Ever wanted to cry in a class? After taking a class with her, you will.
Excellent class - not sure why there are all these negative reviews...she's fantastic
She is tough, but as long as you pay attention (read don't screw around on the internet all class) you will be fine.  Only problem is she is machine gun fast with some material and if you zone out you will miss something.  Seems unapproachable, but if you actually go to her office she is helpful.
It's a good class and she's a good teacher if you pay attention and do the work
Why is she teaching?  Acts pissed off all the time.  She just can't be bothered.  I think she really hates students, or is just painfully shy.
The one professor in my life that I have truly wanted to throw my computer at. I'm serious. She's the problem with tenure.

On another note, hopefully one day she'll smack her forehead or bang it against the board hard enough to realize that she's supossed to teach.
While she may be challenging, Roberts' teaching style gives students an opportunity to learn and apply the law on her own- end the end it all comes together.  If you can't learn how to figure out the law independently in law school-good luck being a lawyer.
Talkes about her biking, expects you to learn the law.  Plays favorites
Could not care less about students.  Waste of time.

doesn't give a damn about teaching;  horrible professor
Poorly thought out lessons.  Only gives a multiple choice test.  Plays favorites
