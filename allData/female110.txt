She was amazing!  She is truly a Renaissance woman.  Professor Angelou often began class by speaking in Latin, French, or Arabic.  She often shared fascinating stories with the  class about her experiences.  Her point was simple -- education can come from more than just a college or textbook.  I highly recommend this professor.

Where exactly did she attend school? Does she have a degree? Or are we to assume that she is just a natural genius. I would also make an argument that she is a horribly redundant and insipid writer, not "inspirational"
Arrogant, spiteful, rude, boring - and possessing a thoroughly mediocre intellect.  The only thing that humanizes her is the supsicion that her incessant bullying stems from an awareness of just what a fraud she is.
Im sorry, great author or not she was a terribly unhelpful professor...she doesnt have a love of teaching..more of a love of self. It irritates me that Wake hired her just b/c of her fame..fame doesnt make you a great prof
Dr. Angelou is helpful towards all students who are serious about their studies.  At first, I was skeptical about her class but after a week or so, I saw Dr. Angelou to be the true inspirational professor she really is.  A fantastic motivator and I hope to have more of her classes in the future.
Very helpful, caring, and an inspiration to all!  Dr. Angelou is DEFINITELY a SHINING STAR for Wake Forest.
Very helpful and caring towards ALL her students, even though there are those who bad-mouth her because she takes no junk from these SLACKERS!!  If you want to learn, Dr. Angelou is the professor to have.
Inspirational!
Accessibility?  Yeah right-- you'll find that her on campus office is actually the bell tower!

Where is she? No one has greater love ,for themself.
There is only one opionion the matters in her class and that is hers.  If you don't have a thick skin avoid her as she will insult you every chance she can
