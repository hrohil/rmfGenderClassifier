She is so exciting even teaching Medieval French. No one can make it come alive like she can. She does an amazing amount of preparation. I think she is the best prepared professor at College of Charleston, and she almost never gets a chance to teach the same class again, where other professors just dust off their old notes. The best ever!!
We read books, saw movies, court métrages with/without dialog, read bande déssinées. We learned critical thinking skills. I improved in thinking and expressing myself.  All of us did. She is amazing. We became a group of friends. We made movies from our papers interpreting Mme Tutli-Putli, a court métrage muet.  She could teach the phonebook. BEST!
AWESOME way to make learning grammar fun.  She used current French songs to illustrate the verb tenses and hard pronouns, so we learned about both grammar and French music.  Best teacher I have had at the College of Charleston and maybe ever because she really cares.  She is from Paris so we heard a good accent. French Again is her grammar website.
Although there were several sections of 202 and all used the same book, Dr. Bourdier used current pop songs and videos to illustrate the grammar, e.g. the various pronouns and verb tenses.  She is an awesome professor now at the College of Charleston in SC.  She cares about our progress and meets "face à face" with us to discuss our future. FUN
Hands down my favorite professor of all time. She cares deeply about her students' academic and personal lives. Get to know her, visit her outside of class, it makes a huge difference. We still keep in touch which I can't say for any of my other professors. She is an inspiration.
Now she teaches at College of Charleston.   She wants everyone in her class to love the French language and culture and goes to all extremes to offer us the opportunities to do just that. Extremely accessible by email and in her office. My speaking got better during this semester.  Now I definitely want to go to France for more practice.
College of Charleston-  Prof. Bourdier designed and taught a new course: French Journalism. The course allowed us to learn  about French news and culture of today. She is a superb teacher, the best  I have had. Her positive attitude is catching. She made this class fun, and we learned a lot about differences and similarities with US reporting.
She is French and different from Americans teachers. She is strict but nice. available, grades fast. very passionate.  gives lots of extra credit options. I didn't like the exams, she said that she took them from the book.  she is a ok grader. I think that she asked us too much for the presentation.  I will take her 314 class next year.
Nnow teaches at College of Charleston in SC. Unorganized and hates the textbook the school requires; instead teaches from her own lectures but tests on everything from the book. She tries to help by giving extra credit but makes the EC almost unattainable unless you have 6 hours a day to devote to just doing that. would never take her again
Fantastic and caring professor. She should be cloned. Gives her 170% if you give  your 70%. You will produce  a better paper than you thought possible. Don't miss the opportunity.
She can be harsh sometimes, but really dedicated and available. She taught me how to write my senor thesis. She taught me how to study and get focus. I recommend.
Madame you are my favorite teacher ever. You were very hard on me but I just got excepted in grad school. Thank you for making me redo my thesis over and over. Thank you for your letter of recommendation.
If you have to take a French class definitely hook up with this prof. If you have a hard time with French she will get you through it. She is readily available for help in class and before class. Very personable and wants you to pass. Her teaching style and pace is the reason I passed. MERCI MADAME
Prof Bourdier is the person who made me like la litérature médiévale. She cares!
Madame Bourdier is a hard worker who wants you to work hard too. besides that she is fun and she really cares. Can be harsh... don't take it personally, she still likes you.
She is an amazing teacher who truly care about the success of her students!
C'est la meilleure professeur! she cares, she makes us laugh and we learn/ super available but she can be strict and sometimes harsh
Madame Bourdier= the best ! I wish she had been my French teacher from preschool all the way up to the University level. She's very intelligent, can teach like no other, and has some great stories about France. If you're in her class, try hard and don't speak in English and you'll do great. Thanks for many great semesters Madame :) You're awesomeee
Madame, YA ROCK! (c'est triste que vous n'enseigne pas le semestre de Fall) Je ne crois pas que vous Ãªtes l'age de ma mÃ¨re :-)
I had Juliette in 2120, 2500, 3050, 3060 and this semester I am taking 3700. She is kinda though but very encouraging and can help with French and with choices in life. If I had to define her i would say that she is Wysiwyg
