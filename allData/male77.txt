Good explanations. CS50 as a course could have been structured better.
Extremely good professor at Harvard, one of the best. Learned all about what an interger was etc.. addition multiplication and even subtraction. You really have to study and have a love for cs.
Professor Malan gives the best lectures I have experienced.
The best professor I have seen in my life, always well prepared with lectures well thought through. Makes the course material accessible and interesting. Highly recommended!
Amazing lectures and explanation skills.
The best professor I've ever heard, would definitely like to take his other courses. David is so inspiring!
I am among those "less comfortable" with CS and if you're like me, you'll love this professor because of his way of teaching - he can make everything understandable. If you're among those "more comfortable" - you'll love him because of his knowledge - no matter how much you already know, you can still learn a lot from him.
Amazing Teacher best teacher I have ever seen
Amazing Teacher
Aweseome
He's very good in teaching in a understandable class hello is one of the best professors and I'm not even from computer science background but still I can still understand the class in abetter way
the best one!
CS50 has been one of my favorite classes.
I'm not done so maybe I can update later. I thought I'd write a review since I taught based on early lectures &amp; taught elsewhere. I have the impression an enormous, incredible amount of thought &amp; effort have been put into this class so it satisfies the goals of those taking it &amp; stays accessible. I haven't seen anything like it. Staff is tops.
Excellent teacher
