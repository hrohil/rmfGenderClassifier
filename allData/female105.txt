I had Professor Brena for Span001, 002 and 102 and she's one of my favorite professors. She's very helpful and really cares about students' learnings. She always encourages me and help me with my spanish pronunciation. In addition, I can see that she tried very hard to organize different class activities thus making the class more interesting.
I had Prof. Brena for Span 001, 002, 101, and 102 at Bryn Mawr College. She was one of the best professors I had at Bryn Mawr and she made the material very accessible and interesting. She engaged students both in and outside the classroom and really encouraged everyone to explore all different areas of interest.
BreÃ±a was such a caring professor and was always super helpful when I visited her during office hours. At times during class, I had a hard time understand her expectations, but she was always open to clarification. She was kind and I found her very dedicated to her students and what she taught!
Profesora Brena was absolutely wonderful! She is engaged in the class, and is genuinely interested in educating us about Latin America and Spain beyond simply learning grammar points and vocab. I learned a lot, and it was a class I never regretted attending, she always makes class interesting and fun. Overall, excellent course, highly recommend it!
Enthusiastic about teaching, very approachable and dedicated to her students. She is also always willing to help.
Dina Brena was by far my favorite Spanish professor in terms of teaching style and personability. She is extremely willing to offer assistance to students, and she is truly invested in helping each person do well. She manages to challenge students while offering a fun and stimulating classroom experience! I highly recommend her classes!
Professora Brena was one of the best professors I've had in college. While the lectures sometimes confused me, she was EXTREMELY helpful in office hours and spent a lot of additional time helping myself and others with things we didnt understand. If one is willing to put in the time and effort, they will absolutley LOVE Dina Brena.
I personally had a great experience with Profesora BreÃ±a. She was hilarious and really engaged with her students. She was always willing to meet with me and was always very professional in class. Hands down one of the best Spanish professors I have ever had.
Very easy and entertaining.
she's irritating and doesn't explain anything properly.
On the whole, she is a good professor.
Like another person complained- there are periods of miscommunication with Breña in which it will always be the student's fault. The syllabus homework was difficult to understand and project dates were changed on a whim. This teacher isn't for everyone and can be more than a little frustrating.
She Brates her students. I don't think she likes to teach.
enthusiastic teacher  compassionate person  speaks something like four or five languages fluently  willing to help in any way approachable
English is her second language--she can be difficult to understand, and when she is confusing, she will often blame it on the students.  Although she does not grade too harshly, her class can be a headache, because you have to work hard to figure out what the homework is.
