watch out, he'll be great in the classroom, but kill you on grading.
I wasn't prepared for this class. The courses I took before made me feel like knew something about L-A lit. Then I learned I needed to relearn. Amazing experience.
Great guy. Emailed when I was sick to send me assignments.
Amazing! Great lectures, intense, be prepared to work. Will be easier on exams than you'd think. He's generous though he looks tough.
I don't know why Penn has to borrow local talent from Bryn Mawr. This was hands down the best course I've taken yet at Penn and will bite the bullet to get into his class next year.
ok, i don't know what prof you guys had but he responded to emails days later, never showed up on time for meetings that we scheduled, and when he was there, he would be there with another student and look at me like i was intruding on something when we had SCEDULED an appointment.  never checked up on me and he was my thesis advisor!
Best teacher I've had yet!!

Lima will waste your time with unorganized class discussion and impossible readings.  Then he will give you tests that make no sense and grade them at random based on how he feels at the time.
Lima was one of the worst professors I have ever had.  He's so arrogant he doesn't he can't even admit that he's an inefficient teacher.  I hate the fact that he was tenured.  He doesn't deserve it.
