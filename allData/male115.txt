Good lecturer, but has a sadistic streak. Complained that a paper I spent an extra month after graduating working on wasn't publishable in Shakespeare Quarterly. I wasn't even specializing in Shakespeare and had only a few weeks to produce the paper. Refused to look at drafts and then wrote A/A- so that I wouldn't know my grade until I checked web.
Shuts down ideas that he does not agree with.  His way or the high way,
The best professor at UChicago. Amazing.
If he does not like you he will sink your career.

Pompous, condescending ... I loved him.
A little intimidating, but incredibly intelligent and interesting -- I took as many classes as possible with him b/c he's just that good.
Pompous, condescending, uninteresting and uninterested.

I think Richard Strier is better marriage material than Al Franken or Michael Moore.  And his class ain't bad also.
Strier is an excellent teacher and superbly learned.  He genuinely loves literature and ideas, and conveys his excitement to others.  One of the few professors here to work with for grad students who prefer aesthetic/text-centered criticism to historicism(s) or theory.
You won't find anyone more knowledgeable about the metaphysicals.  His book on Herbert is wonderful.
Very knowledgeable. His courses ARE interesting, especially if you appreciate English literature!
helpful but not extremely interesting
Richard Strier = Ben Stein

Not as interesting as one might hope and not helpful in the slightest.
