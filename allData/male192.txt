Better suited fr undergrad teaching. For a Masters course dealing with experienced professionals he came across as arrogant. He loves to explain the Algebra and Calculus. Not really required for an MBA -- a better use of time is this is how you use it in excel and this is how your interpret the data. I got more in study sessions with a tutor.
Can take very long time explaining a concept, preferred if he would let student get entire question out, before starting to respond.  otherwise seems genuinely interested in students success.  Just try to be a specific as possible in your questions, because if you don't know, "H' he will want to start all the way at "A' before moving forward.
Not sure a prior negative critique from another reviewer was deleted.  Explanations were lacking and confusing.  His examples were okay, but class discussions would have been better if he was more open-minded and listened to what students were saying/confused about.
stubborn. always took way to long to explain questions to class.
He is very good at giving you examples and projects that help you see the concepts at work in the real world. I found the Marketing Research class that I took with him to be extremelly relevant to the career for which I was preparing. Teacher is very nice and with good humour at times - it's a pleasure to attend his classes.
Good professor, a little arrogant, but made material easy to understand to someone without a math background
Very good teacher.  He explains the meaning of Quant and places emphasis on understanding methodology versus memorizing formulas.

Made quant really easy for me to understand.
If all professors were as helpful, clear, smart, and nice as Derrick, the world would be a better place.  Top 5 instructors of all time.  He actually makes math interesting and fun.
