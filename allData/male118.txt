The easiest class I took at this school. Great teacher and well prepared.
Not a helpful professor.  Grading system is flawed
AMAZING CLASS! although this class is very easy, doug's funny jokes and powerpoints save it from being too boring. plus, i found that a lot of the issues we talk about are prevalent today- we talked about how unstable New Orleans was the year before Katrina happened! By far, the BEST way to fufill your phy sci requirement!
perhaps it's not the most rigorous class, but he's a very good speaker and he knows his stuff.
so borrrrrrrrrrring
I'm sure he'd be an excellent teacher if he didn't tend to teach total joke non-science-major classes.  Really, I'm as glad as any other English major not to have to go to phy sci ever, but he takes it pretty far, nice guy &amp; c. though he is.
Awesome dude!!!!!
An average third-grader could probably get an A in this class. Doesn't seem to know anything outside of actual physical science although course integrates biology and archeology. Shows Tomb Raider clips instead of teaching. Class is a waste of my life.
Super good guy, Doug rocks my socks!  Take any class you can from him, my fav. teacher at this school, and im an econ major ;(
Enthusastic and great lecturer
He is a glaciologist, and you take a feild trip...he's awesome
