Lectures and textbooks were bad.  lecture notes were good.
he's a grandfatherly professor who means well, but he's totally incomprehensible and his lecture is just babbling/regurgitating lecture notes. at least for me, it was really rough, plus 43/e&amp;m is the toughest of the 40s series... i'd really avoid him if you can
Great speaker, kept material interesting.
Very nice, caring, helpful person--very smart--thank you
Really nice.  His enthusiasm in lecture makes physics actually bearable.  He loves doing demos and gives u lecture notes every class, huge bonus.
Notes are incomprehensible. Did not make sense in any of the lectures at all. The class only made sense once I did my problem sets, otherwise was completely useless. Has a strange sense of humor though, has a flair for being theatrical and goofy. The final was suprisingly easy, said it was his "christmas present" for us.
great great man
he reminds me of my grandfather. i loved it
he is unaware of his own arrogance
Shows a lot of concern for students if you approach him, though that's made rather difficult by the horde of students fawning over him during office hours... dare I call them Nobel groupies?
pompous, arrogant, uncool
difficult class, made more so due to confusing, diffuclt, arrogant professor.
His lecture notes are kind of illegible and his lecture can wander off. Likes to mention his award in class a lot. Approachable, though.
a pompous little man.
This guy really loves teaching, and it shows.

Interesting, but kinda hard to understand.
Nice guy, but has a tendency to confuse during lecture.
