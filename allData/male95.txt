"We know in our hearts"  This guy is a great lecturer; he's very clear. But, he's also quirky. One of the best lecturers I've had at Stanford, up there with Scott McKeon
ok lecturer.
Prof. Tendall teaches you the mathematical steps to solve very specific types of problems.  Of course, no one actually learns what anything means, but at least you can get a good grade without understanding "hard" concepts!
Great professor.
Mark is a nice guy and is clearer than many professors, but his teaching style is terrible.  Rather than helping students understand concepts, he focuses on simple computational rote learning.  If you want a very straightforward class where you *don't really learn anything*, you will like this class.
good at explaining things and pretty funny
Wonderful Professor. A brilliant academic whose enthusiasm for economics is contagious. He is interesting, funny, and nice.  He genuinely cares about his students and their success.  I am happy to have taken a class from him.
Really clear and concise.  Great, funny guy.
Solid professor, and a good guy too
Really funny and likes teaching.  Exams and problem sets are straightforward.
very confusing. i understood this stats in 9th grade but can't remember any of it now.. his lectures are sleep-inducing and perplexing.
Horrible teacher.
Such a nice professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to learn. Psets and exams are generally straightforward. No surprises there.
super clear, very easy to do well if you just pay attention.  no tricks on his tests.
very funny, lectures were good, exams fair, but problem sets were intense
Funny in lecture, very student-oriented.  Always available outside of class for help.  Fair exams.
Great professor. One of the best I've had so far.
Absolutely amazing. Turns some people off because of delivery but has very clear and helpful lectures. Also the nicest guy in the department.
Has weird speech delivery.  Should be more direct.
