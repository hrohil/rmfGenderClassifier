Grades by only 4-5 tests. Does not give extra credit. Lectures aren't interactive.
Too smart to interact with the public. Doesn't know how to convey what he is trying to teach.
He can't interact with student  the only prof in our department that no research group. he is so rude
really arrogant he can't teach you any thing so rude and makes you feel stupid
Don't waste time with him.
Hard grader with very difficult tests
Professor Salam is very fast when giving his lectures, and although he is brilliant, his objective comes off as unclear to his students.  He doesn't use curves when grading his tests, and expects the average of the test to be around a 75.  If you have him, teach yourself the material through the book rather than relying on him to clarify.
Professor Salami teaches primary from power point slides with very little textbook usage. Outside class work is mainly optional, with only 5 homework assignments per year. However, tests are ridiculous. Often, he makes concepts more difficult to understand than they actually are. If stuck with Salam, learn from the book, it is clearer than he is
