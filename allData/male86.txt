Inspiring lecturer.
The single best Professor I had while an undergraduate. His courses completely changed my approach to literature and continue to influence the way I think 3 years after graduating. A great professor and a fabulous human being.
Rather brilliant.

One of the best lecturers I've had. Wow, what a stream of eloquence.
Not always scintillating, but still pretty interesting, and probably the nicest professor I've ever had--he tried to get me out of a required class and still asks me how I'm doing and remembers my name, two years after I took his class.

A great teacher with great insights - it is a pleasure to be in his class
Sweet, smart, and genuinely interested in his students.
Do not work with this man.  You will regret it.

a robot, a talking head, keeps his lectures in the refrigerator
One of the best lecturers I had at Harvard.  His insights are fascinating.
Very intellectually exciting class.
