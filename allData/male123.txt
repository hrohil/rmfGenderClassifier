A very committed instructor to teaching with a deep love for maths. Highly competent with a desire to inculcate in learners life skills in problem solving and critical thinking
The Bollerman is the best teacher I have ever had. It's a hard class, but he made it so much fun and interesting, and was incredibly personal with his students and really helpful.
