I had Grebeldinger for Civ Pro 1 and 2. She is a tough grader and sets high expectations, but she is very clear about what she wants. If you take notes, listen to the lectures, read, and apply feedback then you should have no issues in her class. Tip: She doesn't like stupid questions. Only ask a question if it is relevant. Best 1L professor.
Lets just say that when a professor sends out a 12 page email regarding her pet peeves, beware her grading.
If you follow her very specific instructions and pay attention, you can't go wrong.
Most straight forward professor ever.  Make sure you state things her way or else she'll take off points even though it was the right answer.  Anti social and a little crazy.
One of the best professors at Wake!
People skills are lacking. Not helpful.  The class is somewhat straight forward though.
A little odd, however she tells you exactly what she wants and does not hide the ball; refreshing in a law school prof.
If you don't understand what she is teaching you, you are the problem.
Very bad professor.  Very.  Throws information at you and you can't ask questions because it takes her out of her precious schedule.  Wake should save money by just taping her class and playing it back to students.
The class was not interesting, but Grebeldinger teaches in a very clear manner.  I also appreciated her system where only a portion of the class is on call each day, taking some of the stress out of the 1L experience.

This is her gig, and she shines.  Much better than Civ Pro.
She is anal-retentive and vague and just overall rude to everyone.  She expects certain things on exams but won't explain what she wants.
