She is a pretty good professor. She is now at UNCG. The classes are based on powerpoints that you HAVE TO KNOW to do well on the tests, but you also should invest in reading the book. She offers extra credit in the form of outside lectures, and she makes your lowest grade count for less.
I had Prof B for Developmental.  She knows her stuff really well.  Mostly a powerpoint oriented class, tests are not easy, but not impossible.  There is also a 20-hour community service requirement for this class, which wasn't bad at all.  Good class, good teacher.
Class mostly consists of PowerPoints. Decent teacher, but major control freak. Sets a lot of very particular picky rules about the class - they aren't particularly burdensome, but they get to be extremely annoying. Respect is something earned, Ms. B, it's not something you can drag out of people with Rules.
Excellent class.  Doesn't give out A's, but tries her best for everyone to do well.  Highly recommend taking her...
Great professor, interesting class, drops your lowest exam grade which is always appreciated
Great prof. Great dresser. Go Yankees.
