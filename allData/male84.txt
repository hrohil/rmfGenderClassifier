Brilliant world class lecturer.
He's a great teacher.
sucks
His lectures are brilliant and emotion driven.  You bunch of Harvard cry babies are amazing!
I used to climb up onto the balcony during his lectures and fall asleep. Best nap time ever.
dry, but clear
So boring, but so practical
boring lectures wow really boring
Great! nice to not have to endure communist propaganda for once.
Feldstein is great! His lectures are balanced and fair-minded. The people who complain about him are whiny Harvard liberals.
Great course from a distinguished economist.
Lectures are BORING. Super inaccesible. Infrequent lectures. Real teachers in the class are the teaching fellows who are very good.
Too conservative!
No office hours, lectures are very infrequent and uninteresting. Lectures tend to reflect his personal biases on issues like Social Security, Medicare, the EU and so on, and in general have a Reaganomic tilt.

So boring and one-sided.

Boring, presents data from 1996, isn't aware of what is going on in section, doesn't have office hours, teaches conservative propaganda.
