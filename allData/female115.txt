While I am terrified of her upcoming exam, Professor Parker is easily one of the best instructors I have ever had. She is obviously smart, but is also organized, approachable and funny. She made me actually look forward to learning Civil Procedure.
She is the best professor at Wake Forest.
She is an AMAZING professor! I had her for Civil Procedure and, while I don't care for civ pro, she made the class really fun and interesting. She is one of those professors who is really approachable and fun and it's not until you listen to her teach the you realize she's brilliant too. I recommend any class she teaches!
This is a very delayed review. I took professor Parker in the fall of 2008 and she was far and above the best professor I have had in my life. I am now an academic myself and aspire to reach the lofty bar she set in my mind for what defines truly exceptional teaching.
She tries to make class fun, and does a pretty good job.  She is also very organized and gives you the material in a straightforward way. However, it's very apparent that she really prefers male students over females.  She is just much nicer to them and more interactive.  This isn't a huge deal, but it bothers some people.
Great costumes. Drinks lots of seltzer.
Hard grader but excellent  professor.
Very organized; easy to outline.  She does however, use the same examples EVERY year; ie Monk.  And, she knows what an ATV is - don't fall for that.  Pretty straightfoward if you pay attention in class and write up a decent outline.
I love you Wendy Parker.  You are a great teacher.  Thanks for making my first year at law school so much fun in the mornings.
yow; she's good.
