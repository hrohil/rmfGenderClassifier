I don't even go to Stanford, but some of his lectures are online and I've learned more from them than any of my actual classes.
Does an excellent job of explaining tough material.
Dr. Sapolsky's class is absolutely incredible. He's easily the most animated and engaging lecturer I've had. Each lecture is around two hours, but it almost never feels that long. I would highly recommend this class (and anything else taught by Sapolsky) to any person with the opportunity to take it.
Human Behavioral Biology, offered through youtube and iTunesU, is easily the best class I've ever taken. I highly recommend it to everyone. Sapolsky's passion and understanding of behavior will benefit everyone no matter what they are studying.
One of the best teachers in the world. Taking a Dr. Sapolsky class is one of the great experiences of a persons life.

Sapolsky is legendary.
Best teacher in the Biology department by far
Amazing prof.
Amazingly great teacher
Best teacher I've had --- hands down. And probably the best class I've taken at Stanford. There are simply no words to describe the experience. He is funny, animated, approchable, makes materal accessable for understanding, and just blows your mind by the connections he makes between different fields. You are literally on the edge of the seat..
The Best prof I've ever seen.
Best class. Period.
There should be a portal into Spolsky's head. Freakin. Great.
you must take the class before leaving Stanford. One of the best at Stanford.
One of the best classes I've taken at Stanford (no wonder it always has 500+ students).  Sapolsky's amazing.

Took this some years ago when I was on campus.  Sapolsky managed to mix amygdalas, hormones, and stories from africa to make a class with 100s of students feel like it was a class of ten.
Human Behavioral Biology is the best course I have taken at Stanford and Sapolsky is by far the best lecturer I've ever had here.
One of the best lecturers at Stanford.
