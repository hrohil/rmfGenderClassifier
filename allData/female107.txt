I usually lurk on this site, but I HAD to write a great review, because Dr. Lukacs deserves it. She does a lot of extra behind-the-scenes work to make sure that the material is fully grasped by her students. And SERIOUSLY if you encounter any problems, just go to her. But you have to be prepared to give it your all, too.
Dr. Lukacs is AMAZING. She is always available to help and her labs help you understand the course material!
I suggest you get on her good side asap by being magically brilliant at Chem and be one of the few kids that finishes in 50% of the time because otherwise, you will not get any special treatment and she probably won't like you. Make sure you do ALL the work and if you are confused, don't ask her, ask your TA. Lab is only worth 30% so focus on Lec
extremely helpful. get back to students ASAP and really good explanation for things
103/104 Krynn was AMAZING, the best lab professor I've had thus far. She's always sooo helpful and she never makes you feel stupid for asking ANY question. Plus, she gets back to you ASAP for any questions (as in I've gotten literally instant replies from her before, which is great)
she is AMAZING.  so fantastic. she teaches things incredibly clearly.   the labs she designs beautifully complement what we are learning in class but pushing the student a little bit farther
Great prof.
