good
Wow
Such an inspirational professor
Michael Miner is incredible! He really cares about students and if you ask for help you will get it, even if he has to give up his free time! He really knows the subject matter and is an incredible writing instructor who taught me SO much!
He is a very helpful and fair minded. Well versed and authoritative on subject matter. Future Professor
Does some lecturing but a great writer. Helpful and going places.
Makes every class worth it...
A knowledgeable guy, and one of the few TA's I have had who does not see the job as an annoyance, or an intrusion on his other commitments. He is genuinely interested in helping his students learn to write with clarity and accuracy; he is knowledgeable about his field, and generous in sharing his knowledge. A rare pleasure among TAs!
Quiet, but smart. Very engaging one on one and knows his stuff.
Straight forward. Work hard, you will do well.
Not a full professor yet but seemed much more capable than the senior faculty. Smart but not condescending, hard to find in this place sometimes.
Summer class.
I did not have a lot of interest in this class but had to take a writing course, so this seemed like a good option. He takes the time to help you become a better writer - you do not get that kind of help in other classes.
This class was not my thing but he helped me get something out of it. Can't ask for much more than that - work with him if you can.
I came into the class an average writer...at best...but I am leaving with much more confidence as my writing has improved dramatically. What more can you ask for?
Reaaally nice guy and makes you work.
Really great fellow - knows his material and helped my writing immensely.
