Professor Cohen uses anecdotes to elucidate the concepts that are hiding in different texts. This is particularly helpful when dealing with authors with more, shall I say, obscure styles (*cough* Kant). And, by way of these practical examples, the material stays with you if you put forth the effort to listen well - just an excellent professor.
My only regret is I didn't take a course from him until my senior year.
good
Some may think he gets sidetracked, but when you look back on the class, one realizes that everything he says is totally applicable to one's education in the broadest sense.  Take classes with this man.
Very stylistic lectures, amazing and insightful with bone-dry wit.  Just a brilliant, brilliant man.
amazing!
Genius. Funny. Caustic. Goes off topic but it's almost worth 40,000$ a yr. to hear him speak. One of the smartest people most of us will ever have a chance to listen to, so hang om every word!
outstanding, if you're smart enough to follow him
chain-smoking, joke repeating, but awesome.
Very helpful. Listens and encourages participation of undergrads unlike other snob/bore prof's who dislike teaching undergrad courses.  GRAD STUDENTS MAY HOLD THAT AGAINST HIM, THOUGH.
Very difficult.  Clearly knows his stuff, but does not stay on topic.
very good on austin.

incapable of staying on topic. Foul-mouthed. Self-impressed.
