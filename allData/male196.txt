He is a really nice person and is clearly passionate about the subject he teaches. Sometimes, however, he does not explain the problem(s) or topic(s) as thoroughly as he should, which can cause some confusion. I would suggest doing as many of the bonus questions as you can and memorizing not only how to do certain problems, but the theorems.
Before I took this class, I really hated math. It confused me, and just didn't make sense. I can honestly say this professor has really changed my outlook on the whole thing. He doesn't start with high up theorems, but rather with a problem solving approach. His tests are very fair, and the homework he assigns really helps. Highly recommended!
Great teacher. Great class. Just keep up with all the homeworks and ask questions whenever you have them and you will be fine. Also make sure to do all the extra credit assignments.
Excellent and one of the best teachers - EVER!!!

Professor Robinson is easily the best teacher that I have had so far here at Wake.  He truly cares that his students learn the material and explains complicated math equations clearly enough to make them seem obvious.  Take him!!
This is the nicest guy you will ever meet.  Also, he knows his material and keeps you interested in what he is teaching.
