awesome teacher. intro to hindu traditions was very interesting but not too much work. would definitely recommend taking a class with dr. whitaker, even if you're not interested in studying religion
He's a really cool guy, but be warned- his classes are RIGOROUS. A ton of dense reading. He rarely ever gives A's. He really likes to challenge his students, so if you're up for it, take Whitaker.
Absolutely amazing professor, his classes are hard to get into but if you've taken a class with him before or go to his office hours he gives it pois. Everyone should try out his classes, they supply good information but most importantly they make you think. Great professor.
good discussions, lets the students give input.
No one should graduate without taking this professor at least once.
Great prof. Interesting class discussions.
