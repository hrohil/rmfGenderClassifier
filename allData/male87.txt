I honestly don't know how anyone can say absolutely anything bad about him. Even though his classes are super early, I genuinely look forward to going to them. Wish he'd adopt me just so I don't have to leave him!
The BEST professor ever. He is extremely not judgemental, has a big heart, and is caring for all his students. I was very, very touched by just how much feedback he was willing to give per paper. He sees the best in you, and is not at all reluctant to give you credit for your hard work. He is a true scholar who is passionate about teaching.
Great professor/ Remarkably personally modest, kind &amp; tolerant/ Talented man who knows how to appreciate talent.
This teacher is absolutely amazing!

Leo Damrosch is a top-shelf professor.  You will not be disappointed.
Kind of mediocre.  I enjoyed the singing, though, and the quizzes that counted as a third of your grade.
Leo Damrosch is an incredible teacher.
This class covered an area of literature I wasn't initially interested in - but the overall quality of the course and instruction was very good.
fantastic lectures, try to take 10b with him as well
Insightful, witty, perpetually engaging
Professor uses crystal clear explication with a shot of humor and personality.  Especially when he brings his fife to class.
great course. take Damrosch &amp; Vendler, forget the rest.
fantastic teacher. his classes crackle with intelligence
superb - the teaching you dream about when you come to Harvard
Best lecturer at Harvard. Witty, erudite, brilliant.
