DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. While tests are standardized amongst the Organic Chemistry II professors, 1/3 of your grade will be determined by her quizzes and final supplement. Gives pop quizzes and normal quizzes almost every other class and they are incredibly difficult and not curved. If she is the only option do not take it that semester.
Good lectures. Unfortunately unless you live, breathe, and bleed organic chemistry, these will do you no good. The exams are next to impossible and quite unreasonable for the amount of time allotted. On top of that, she usually coordinates lab, and it is a disaster. Just ask the poor TAs that have to work for her.
GRADE DEFATION. She takes joy in making test too long and difficult.
Wonderful teacher, puts a lot of effort and excitement into her teaching.
She does not keep up class discussion. She grades you ridiculously hard on research papers by grading you down and not having an explanation why. She devises a points system out of no where to justify giving you the grade you receive.
Dr. King really sparked my interest in Chemistry.  Her tests were hard, but fair.  You really have to learn the material to do well, but she is very understanding and helpful if you ask.

Very clear, very helpful, expects alot of students, but not unreasonable. Study and and do well on the homeworks and you'll soar.
