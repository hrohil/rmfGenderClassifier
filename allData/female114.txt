I think Lisa is a fantastic prof. She will challenge your pre-conceptions and she has high standards (neither of which are a bad thing). The only people I know who didn't like her or her class were those who either did not read the books or were not interested in learning anything new.
Boring and bad discussion.
I just couldn't get into this class.  Her approach to every novel was the same -- feminist, feminist, feminist -- and it just got old.  I just can't believe that's the only way to approach this stuff.  Plus I didn't find the professor to be very helpful or accomodating.
Best class I had at Wake. Lisa is a phenomenal prof, and she really makes you think. It's true that she's tough, but she's very helpful and always willing to help. She forces you to approach your ideas in new ways, and she's always willing to listen to what everyone in the class has to say.
too blinded by her own huge ego to be either fair or rational as a teacher.  the only views welcome are those which mirror her own.  never again.
abrasive + agressively opinionated + surly personality + ineffective teacher = STEER CLEAR!!!
Prof. Sternlieb was without a doubt the worst teacher I've ever had.  She is unhelpful, condescending, and extremely bigoted.  If you are a guy, don't take her--she hates men!
She was more interested in talking about how evil the Greek life at Wake is than discussing the books we were supposed to be reading.
A truly remarkable woman--she changed my life.
difficult and unhelpful.  What was that with the body comments below?
For some of us Lisa is more than just a great teacher: she's an inspiration.  I used to hide under layers of clothing, but Lisa's comfort with her own body, her willingness to wear red, changed my self-image completely.  Thank you, Professor Sternlieb.
