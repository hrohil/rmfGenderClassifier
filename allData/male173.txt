My favorite professor at Portland State.
He's hot. I bet every girl secretly has/had a crush on him. The man with the brain��
Ed is an amazing teacher who cares about his students success. His tests are hard! But I felt like they me to keep pushing myself to really understand the material. Everything you need to know is what he says and whats on the slides. I stopped reading the book after the first exam. I just started re-watching and transcribing his lectures.
Ed was a good teacher. Hes kinda out there but he goes over everything in class that you need for the exams and he will prepare you for whatever program youre going in to. His tests werent easy but I definitely wouldnt say theyre the hardest tests ever like many people have said. I did change this class to P/NP because it was difficult.
I took the summer Human A&amp;P course and completely loved Ed. Although his exams were difficult, I did not find them barbaric. I really appreciated that he asked questions to the class/students and utilized multiple learning styles throughout each lecture. He says everything on the exam is based off of lecture but I would recommend reading the text.
Ed is a really nice guy.  His lecture style is engaging and informative but he writes the most detailed, difficult exams I've ever experienced.  If you're a detail person who doesn't mind reading, you'll do fine.  If you're a big-picture thinker, or if you can't remember what you read, expect this to be the hardest class you ever take.
I took summer herpetology with Ed and it was amazing. I recommend everyone take this 6 credit summer course if you can. There's also a summer field trip you can participate in if you want. Sometimes he's a little inappropriate but overall he's a legend and the best professor I've ever had! Wish PSU had him for more classes.
This guy is the Herpetology master! He is passionate about biology and herpetology and that carries over to the subject matter.  He does go on tangents, but they are still relevant and contribute to the peripheral knowledge needed to be a truly analytical scientist of any kind.
I love Ed! Come to class and take notes on all recorded lectures with slides as well. Rarely used textbook. I love how Ed always gives an explanation for why processes work. For example, instead of passing a statement "women bloat during menstrual cycle," he'll also explain WHY. Respect:) Aced the whole year, highly recommend!
He  is very knowledgeable and great for auditory learners. As a visual learner, I often struggled to fully process topics he was explaining in class. His lectures and powerpoints usually cover "everything" on the test, but this course takes a lot of outside effort (his video lectures, online videos, flashcards/diagrams). He is considered a bio god.
I understand why Ed has a cult following, he's hilarious, however, being dynamic and entertaining does not translate into being effective. He often goes on rants which take away from the actual lecture. 3 exams per term, heavy curve. Not my style of teaching, but I am sure works out  for most. Bummed I stuck around for all 3 terms, honestly.
You do not need the book he records and posts all lectures. Never thought I would be able to learn for lecture recordingsbut seriously only lectures from what is said in class. Study by listening to lectures while looking at slides and passed with an A. He curves his exams. His lectures are interesting and engaging.
I have taken many science courses prior to anatomy, so that helped tremendously to have that background. For the first exam, I tried reading the textbook and doing notecards but found that to be unhelpful. Go to lecture, as well as listen and take notes on all recorded lecture he send outs. Barely used the textbook after 2nd exam.
His tests and lectures and tests are geared towards pre-med students, and students who have nothing else to do but study. Material is presented very quickly, and he often goes on meaningless tangents that have nothing to do with what will be on the tests. His study guides are vague, if you are not a confident test taker then do not take his class.
Best teacher I've ever had, hands down no question; also the hardest class I've ever taken. Deeply cares for students who give their best. The immense knowledge he has taught me will stay with me forever, and I know what he's taught me will save lives one day.  More knowledgeable than any teacher I've encountered at OHSU; smartest person I've met.
Ed is a great teacher, he really wants students to learn and understand the material. i had him for 301 and 303 but had to take Hancock for 302 (i preferred Ed). Don't get the book, just study using the  recorded lectures.
Ed is hands down the best professor I've had. His tests are difficult, but they challenge you. His curve is beyond generous. Great for anyone who will be taking the MCAT, DAT, OAT etc. Goes out of his way to help students and provide mentorship. He will put you on the spot during lecture. I wish he utilized D2L for grades.
Not an easy class at all. However, lectures are actually engaging and everything from his tests are straight out of lecture or his powerpoint slides. Very brutal exams but generous curves for all three of them (he will throw out the outliers) Funny guy, highly recommend!
Lectures are interesting, but get ready to study, study, study. His testing is out of this world, felt like I knew good amount going in to test and would leave feeling like it was so so hard and I didn't know that much after all. Read the lecture chapter before lectures and study and ASK questions. He's very helpful.
Ed is not hilarious, he tries to be funny but it is very annoying. He constantly picks on students in class and sometimes he can be very inappropriate. He is distracting to take lecture with because he rocks back and forth  and also constantly makes an annoying grunting sound to clear his throat.  Would not take again. Very annoying to listen to.
