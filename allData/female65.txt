She is a hard working teacher and enjoys teaching...easy on the eyes and very knowledgable.  Good professor.  To say, "she is out of her league" is just pure pompous".  We all can get the same education with a library card..."news flash -- there is no original thought!" What do people expect?
brilliant, generous, caring, wise
Brilliant, compassionate, magnificent, alert, original, caring, knowledgeable.  An A++++++++ transaction.
Elaine Scarry is a truly talented critic. She is also one of the most moral people I know.
Elaine Scarry is the nicest, most brilliant, encouraging, generous, and insightful professor you will ever meet.  She taught me everything I know about the Victorian novel.  I loved her presentations about Jekyll &amp; Hyde with the film clips.  She is a goddess.

She's one of the best teachers I've ever had.
A brilliant woman, generous to a fault, with a vast intellect and peerless insights into the nature of just about everything.  Harvard College students who disagree are shallow morons.
