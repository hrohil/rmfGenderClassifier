He honestly is my favorite professor. He genuinely cared about the success of each student. I'm so glad I had him my first semester here at Wake.
Prof. Franco is awesome. I went in to his office hours before every paper and he was super helpful. I am an science-y person, but I kept up with the readings and participated in class which really helped.
LOTS of reading. Not many grades besides the large papers, but he's extremely helpful and encourages students to see him before they turn it it. It's all discussion so be prepared to talk about the texts or it'll be awkward
One of the best professors I've ever had! He runs the class as a discussion/ seminar, which really forces everyone to read and prepare for class beforehand. He is an extremely tough grader of essays, but I improved my writing abilities 10-fold after taking Dr. Franco's class. He really got excited about the literature, which is also a strength!
He's a good teacher with good ideas. The class is very interesting and the texts are wonderful. Take it!
Excellent, I'm definitely not an "english person", but with a decent amount of time and interest, I learned a lot and truly enjoyed the class.
Great teacher
awesome teacher and a great guy who will do anything to see you succeed.  really inspired me to want to be an English major.
By far one of the best professors you're going to get here, he will literally jump through hoops to help his students.  A must take.
Hidden gem of Wake Forest faculty. Incredibly intelligent, very helpful, entertaining. I wish all professors at Wake were this inspiring.
Super sexy
