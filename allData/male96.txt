The greates
A brilliant intellectual and gifted mentor!  One need only read his 'The Lucifer Effect' to understand why he is among the foremost leaders in the field of  Psychology. His students should be honored to be a part of his academic conversation.
He is his best promoter. Left wing to our detriment.
A mixed bag.  Zimbardo is entertaining and insightful, but also highly egocentric and arrogant.  Seems more interested in demonstrating how brilliant he is than in really teachingâ€”more of a showman than an educator.

Kind of full of himself, but hell, he's the****.
funny, interesting, likes to talk about himself a lot
I love his movies! Especially the talking picnic basket! He's double hot! I love his approch to studying 'UMANITY.
He was always helpful and interested and made a personal commitment to undergraduate students.

Class is easy and entertaining.  Unfortunately, Zimbardo is more of a showman than a teacher.  Take it if you're looking for a fun class and an easy A.
Zimbardo gave me back my faith in Stanford. Psych 1 redefined my academic trajectory.
hes an amazing psychologist. i loved him as a teaher
