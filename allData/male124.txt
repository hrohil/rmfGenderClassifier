Professor Archer has great lectures and a clear grading scale.
He is a very good and entertaining professor
Great prof!
Teaches material at level non-science students can understand. Looks just like Hugh Laurie from House M.D.
Very aloof. Not helpful to students. Travels too much.
He needs to be more approachable. It's like he lives in his own mind. Doesn't communicate.
He has the kindest eyes..
such a cute geek
Excellent professor. Clearly loves what he does.
