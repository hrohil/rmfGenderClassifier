Hands down best teacher I've ever had. Had him for little red schoolhouse, which was great. Extraordinary lecturer. Also had him for his first run at Writing Speeches: Reagan &amp; Obama. In the small setting he is brilliant. Deft unpacking of Heidegger. Truly a remarkable facilitator of discussions.
The best course I ever took at U of C.  Larry is an absolute genius who will blow your mind by opening up everyday text and uncovering more layers than you could have ever believed were there.
My best class ever
Everyone loves Larry!
This is the best class I took at Uof C. Professor McEnerney taught me how to write and it has made a huge positive impact on my life professionally and academically.  Take the Little Red School House!  You will be really glad you did!
This is the best course I took at U. of C., and I had come to study graduate English--not Education.  But Larry's class is completely engrossing, pleasantly disorienting, and endlessly thought-provoking.  Unlike most professors at the school, he is never research first and teaching second...because his "other life" does not involve research at all.
One of the best teachers I had, a must-take course.
He is such a great professor, you learn a lot about writing in his class, it is fun and interesting.
Larry is a god of rhetoric.  If you want to learn something you'll use, this is the class to take.
he is really smart and fun and challenging
this remains one of the best courses i've had here; it helped my writing improve dramatically.  he gives tons of feed back, and really spends time discussing students' work with them. he even runs his writing seminars, rather than having a TA.  i still go
best teacher i've had at u of c, hands down
How can you possibly assign a coveted pepper to one who habitually wears a sport jacket with jeans?
