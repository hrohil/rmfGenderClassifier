Great philosophy professor really helps you grasp the big picture
One of the best profs at Stanford. Clear, great lectures, very inspirational
Awesome, smart, helpful, hot
Best professor I ever had at Stanford. His class on existentialism changed my life.
Lanier Anderson is the most obviously brilliant person I've ever met, and likely the best professor as well. He clearly puts a lot of effort into writing and rehearsing his lectures, and it pays off; they are fascinating. I am stunned that there are people who don't recognize how amazing this guy is.
Passion: 28% F
Best teacher of my life! And totally HOT! :)

lanier has this awesome way of knowing your name and referring to your point and how it fits into the discussion
Insightful, eloquent, wonderful at engaging a great discussion
Very good class, but his co-professor (J. Landy) takes the spotlight.
****!!!!!!!!!!!
Co-teaches an excellent class on Phil and Lit with Joshua Landy
This dude was unintelligible.  My dad came to visit (he's a college professor), and he said it was the worst lecture he'd ever heard.  Lanier's smart as hell, and I think an interesting guy, dedicated to teaching, but talks too damn fast, and reads too much from lecture notes.  I think I'd dig him in office hours, but lectures?  SNORE.
HARD AS HELL

Read from lecture notes too often.
HE IS VERY HOT!! BUT DONT LET HIM FOOL YOU!
He was a good, solid professor.  I enjoyed how wrapped up he was in BEING professorly and performing the role well.  It really felt like one was studying philosophy in the grand traditions of the discipline.
Who cares how he teaches? He's hot!
