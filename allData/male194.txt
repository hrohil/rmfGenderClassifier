Favorite professor at wake! really entertaining and engaging classes. make sure to pay attention to all his analogies (and use them on exams/paper), even if they don't make sense the first time around. once you learn the material, it all clicks into place.
my favorite professor.
This guy has to be one of my favorite teachers at Wake. He's hilarious and smart at the same time. It was refreshing to not have a professor who takes everything so seriously all the time.
The most entertaining lecturer at Wake- Loved Con with him and found him extremely helpful outside of class-
Great professor...I really enjoyed his classes...though several people didn't like him....guess it depends on your personality
Entertaining, although I have no idea what I actually learned.
Had him for Con Law I and II, thought he was confusing and probably insane.  Took him for Comparative Con Law and Jurisprudence because the classes sounded good and found out that Parker's a lot of fun in smaller classes. Don't let Con Law scare you away!!  These classes were two of the best I took in law school.
Smart guy. Bad teacher.
