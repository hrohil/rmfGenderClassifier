A gentle-man in the literal sense of the word. His speech is a little slow, and as I took the course online, I watched it at 1.5 speed, but otherwise very knowledgeable without a hint of personal conceit, which is something I really respect in a teacher.
He is an amazing speaker with profound knowledge and articulation about Islam and other beliefs.
AMAZING GUY AND PROFESSOR
Super nice guy,test were ridiculous but enjoyed the class.Also he really loves pickles.A jar of pickles will give you 5 extra points on the test.
Dr. Asani provided wonderfully clear 2 hour lectures for my Islam course.  I learned a great deal about expressions of the Islamic relgion and feel like we only scratched the surface.  I would take him and his course again in a heartbeat.  I would add that Dr. Diane Moore assisted in the online discussions and offered significant insight.
Very motivating

One of the kindest man I have met, especially for someone of his academic stature.  He was generous both of his time and knowledge and greatly facilitated my learning of the myriad prisms of Islam.  Highly recommended.
