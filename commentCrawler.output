I took the Python classes on Amazon/video. When i started I knew absolutly nothing about programing and or computers, I was totaly green, but with his lectures has made it so easy that i keep wondering where was I yesterday. Kudos ! an exceptional teacher, Humble and to the point. Thank you. i'm going to continue with the rest of his classes too.
Taking his course on coursera -- I should have gone to Michigan; he is the most clear, engaging, and thoughtful professor, and I get all that from an ELECTRONIC course/MOOC
very nice
I took his course on Coursera.
Amazing Dr Chuck!
OMG - best professor I've ever had for a MOOC. So many prestigious universities have very very very subpar MOOC courses, scripted boring content, etc. Dr. Chuck rocked this thing - like - rocked so hard that I would take every course he offers. I'm super excited that he is involved in the web design course I'm about to take. GREAT JOB DR. CHUCK
One of the terrific teachers I have come across as a student over the last 50 years. I took his course on Python programming and he taught the course so well that it sunk in quickly even for me.
Gifted teacher, excellent lecturer, one of the best I have ever had
ok
Dr Chuck is a rare combination. Someone who intimately understands the subjects he teaches, and has the ability to communicate and explain difficult concepts in a way that doesn't assume lots of prior knowledge but also doesn't dumb down the material. It's obvious he enjoys teaching and that in turn makes we want to learn more
Great professor.. Makes even difficult topics seem like cakewalk
I think Dr. Chuck is a very good professor, because he obviously is genuinely interested in transferring knowledge to the students and at the same time is proficient in what he is doing.
Made me feel like he was really personally invested in me learning the subject, even though I was taking a MOOC and never met him. Inspirational person and a true educator at heart.
Professor Severance has the rare gift of talking to the students. In other words he teaches as though he was talking to you as a friend, or peer. As a student you know the instructor has a mastery of what he/she teaches. Being a former military instructor I have seen this trait rarely, and only the best of the best have the trait.
Makes subject pretty interesting
One of the best professors I have every taken that I never met in person.
Dr. Chuck gives really really amazing lectures that make everything clear and well-organized.
he is a very good teacher!
he teaches programming in an interesting way.
Prof is great
Teacher name: Nolta, Kathleen
School name: University of Michigan

Teacher comments: 
Best professor of all time. Use all the resources she provides on canvas and watch all the recordings!
I love this crazy cat lady with my whole heart. Her exams are more challenging, but she's such an amazing and engaging lecturer that it makes up for it. She goes out of her way to be accessible and gets to know many of her student my name. No lie if you email her a picture of a problem you're stuck on she'll get back to you in minutes.
I hate chemistry, but Dr. Nolta is the reason I'm still pushing through. She is an amazing lecturer and you can tell she is 100% committed to her job.
her notes are SO perfect and she keeps lectures very entertaining
She is literally the best human ever and is so nice. Talks to you like you're an equal and is always willing to explain a concept to you, even if you need her to 584329085 times. This was the first lab I have taken that I actually enjoyed and I believe a large part of that was attributed to her.
AMAZING HUMAN BEING!
Nolta is the best professor I have ever come across in my entire life. Orgo is v tough but she makes it understandable and actually enjoyable. She is cute and quirky in her lectures and even gave us candy bars at her workshop one time. She goes over the entire coursepack which is so incredibly helpful. Go to her office hrs+every extra workshop!!!
Dr. Nolta cared about the success of her students. I bombed the first 2 exams, but did very well on the final 2 and received an A for showing an huge improvement with my test scores. She also provides A TON of resources and additional help in-person and over email. Highly recommend, especially for the spring/summer semester if available.
Can't recommend her enough. She made me want to go to orgo lectures (not just because of the need to learn material, but because her lectures are actually quite enjoyable to attend). I laughed a lot in this class, and she seemed to really care about her students. Make use of many of the resources she provides (ex. past exams) and orgo will be fine
She is the best and most caring professor I have ever had. Made orgo so much fun! Her notes are amazing, too!
Very informative class but requires memorization of SO. MUCH. INFORMATION. where studying usually ended with rocking back and forth while laughing uncontrollably. Exams are about 20% multiple choice and 80% short answer questions and are brutally specific, but compensated from a huge curve and by having Nolta. I wouldn't take this with anyone else.
Nolta is 100% WORTH THE HYPE! If you can, wait + take orgo w/her. Teaches in a way that's easy to understand + notes are beautiful (color-coordinated!). Genuinely wants you to succeed + has lots of resources to help you. Nicest lady, makes lecture fun and engaging (songs of the day every lecture that relate to material). Gives out candy 24/7 also
Nolta is an amazing professor and a very kind and genuine individual. She wants each and every one of her students to succeed. I struggled with orgo in the beginning but as I reached out to her the better I became. It's really worth it to go to her extra office hours/workshops, and use all her past exams to review for tests . Take orgo with her!!
Nolta is the sweetest professor I have ever had. She is soo caring and wants you to do well in the class. Her lecture boards are BEAUTIFUL and easy to follow. I would recommend going to her office hours/go aheads/workshops. I found those to be more helpful for the exam than lecture. I found her exams a lot harder than the practice exams though.
I love how Nolta obviously cares about her students and how they understand the material. She knows it's hard. But she is so willing and available to help students. Her enthusiasm truly knows no bounds and that is amazing. She's also pretty OCD and makes fun of that a lot, which is super cute. She has so many resources of her own as well as others.
Dr. Nolta is just a wonderful wonderful human. I was terrified of taking orgo, because I didn't like gen chem much, but she made me LOVE it! voluntarily signed up for orgo 2 next semester because I just can't get enough. Might change to biochem or chem major. She is very clear, but office hours are what really seals the deal. Go to all of them.
I hate chemistry a lot but actually enjoyed this class. Nolta is one of the best teachers I have ever had and is very caring and welcoming to students who struggle. If you have to take orgo, she's worth waiting a semester if you have to.
Orgo is very difficult, in general, but Dr. Nolta will show you your way through the material. She makes lectures understandable, her office hours are sooo helpful! GO TO THEM (coursepack solutions!) Her exams are "tough," but they are really just comprehensive and wanting to know if you can do the material inside and out.
I've heard that in previous semesters the chem 216 lab has been difficult and time consuming but Nolta made going to lab every week a very pleasant experience.
Dr. Nolta is one of the best professors I have taken here at umich. She cares so much and her lectures are truly an experience that I wont forget. Her extra OH (which she doesnt have to do but still does) are amazing and I recommend going to them. Introduce yourself to her, you wont regret it.
Teacher name: Conforth, Bruce
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
One of the most inspirational professors of all time. He made me laugh by dancing on desks, and cry on the last day of class with his emotional annecdote on pursing our dreams. He gave every student a special business card with a painting on it to go with the story that I still carry in my wallet to motivate me everyday. Also learned SO much.
Bruce Conforth is the most passionate, intelligent, and talented person and musician I have ever met.  I wish I took more of his courses, as his History of American Blues Music enhanced my perspective on so many things. A true icon of the music world.
I am so lucky to have taken a class taught by this guy! Insanely passionate and funny, really knows his stuff, and I never wanted to miss a lecture.
Coolest dude ever, really knows what he's talking about and cares about students. Class was based on weekly reflection papers, 3 take-home online quizzes, midterm, final, and one project. Don't bother doing any readings - don't even buy the book. Go to his office hours with your midterm, he will give you points back.
If you show up to class every day and really pay attention to his lectures, Bruce will probably change your life - fair warning. I have never had another professor that has half the passion and zeal that he brings to every single lecture. He cares immensely about the topics that he teaches and he cares about his students even more. Don't miss out.
This was my favorite class of all time. Bruce teaches because he wants to inspire, and he wants students to reflect on what they are doing with themselves. I never missed a lecture because they were so interesting, and I would talk about what I'd be learning with my friends because I enjoyed it to that extent. Definitely take a class with Bruce
This guy was great! He was passionate each and every day he came to class and seemed as knowledge as anyone about the information he was teaching. The material reflected a great deal of personal depth and experience. He was rarely competitive. There are two exams with easy online homework in-between. On the whole, a worthwhile class.
The fact that Dr. Conforth is a great scholar in the subjects he teaches (I've taken AC208, AC219, and AC405 with him) the fact that he has personal experience in each topic makes him an invaluable resource as a teacher.  I doubt that there are many other professors who have as much and as extensive real world experience in their topics as he does.
Bruce's seminar on American Folk music was an amazing experience.   We discussed the incredible link between folk music and left wing politics (something I knew nothing about), the ways in which people band together as communities and create art to express themselves and build solidarity,  and so so much more.  Amazing class.
Legend
Easily one of the best professors at UM. Never known a single person to have a bad opinion of him. He is incredibly knowledgeable about the 60s and the hippy movement (as a result of him being very deeply ingrained in it). His stories make each class fun, and I am changing my plans for future classes to take more with him.
Hippies, Beatniks, and Punks was the best class I've taken at U of M so far. I actually WANTED to go to class, because Bruce is such an inspirational guy. His lectures are really interesting, I felt like I got to know all three of the subcultural groups, but my favorite parts of the class were Bruce's life stories. Definitely take this class.
After 4 years I finally got to take Bruce's subcultures course and wow was it worth the wait!  I don't think there are any other professors like Bruce anywhere.  He's caring, compassionate, unbelievably intelligent, witty, funny, hot as hell, and just is everything and more that you'd want in a professor.  An amazingcourse,  Bruce is incredible!
Bruce Conforth is honestly one of the best professors I have had. He makes everyone feel like they matter in his class. He tries to make his lectures not only about the information, but also about life in general. The quizzes and tests are kind of tough, but this class is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Take it.
This is the 3rd class I've taken with Professor Conforth and every one has been remarkable.  He's a great teacher.  Clear, concise, interesting, funny, and extremely knowledgeable.  He's just an amazing prof.  The best UM has to offer.
This class has been nothing short of astonishing.  I never experienced anything like the remarkable way Dr. Conforth teaches and I don't think I ever will again.  He's the smartest, most caring professor you could want.  I've already learned more about the topic and life than I have in all my other classes combined and I'm a senior! Take his class
It is absolutely unbelievable the way that Bruce teaches a class.  Not only is he an amazing scholar and knows so much about so many things, the life lessons he teaches you are remarkable.  If you go to class (you'll want to) and you pay attention (it's hard not to) you'll leave his class an infinitely greater person.
I was expecting a bit more from Professor Conforth; with all the hype, i thought this would be the greatest class I ever took by a long shot. Not the case - while the course was interesting, it just didn't live up to the hype. Not hard to get a good grade if you study enough for the exams, and lecture was always fairly interesting to attend.
Bruce is a legend at UM and there many reasons why.  He's compassionate, incredibly interesting, REALLY knows a LOT, worked at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and as a musician, he's a scholar, but most of all he REALLY cares if you learn the stuff in class and how you can apply it to your own life.  He's hands-down the best prof at UM!
Dr. Conforth is an awesome professor.  His lectures are very interesting and you can tell he genuinely enjoys the subject matter.  The class is pretty easy to get a B- in, but beyond that you really need to work hard to get a better grade.  I, unfortunately, realized I was not interested in folklore, but Dr. Conforth still made lectures interesting
Teacher name: Malley, Brian
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Basically, you have Joe Rogan as a teacher. More than just a physical resemblance, Prof. Malley also has a history of martial arts, a great speaking voice, and is very intelligent. I encourage you to talk to him in office hours. As long as you attend class and discussion regularly, should be an easy A. No exams, just 6 open note pop quizzes.
Malley is a really funny guy, but I didn't take his intro psych class to hear him crack jokes and share his own "opinions" about psychology. It seemed like he never really knew what he was talking about, because he was always having to ask the GSIs (who sat in the front) for clarification. Also, his pop quizzes are graded way too tough
Do yourself a favor and write down the entire textbook that he makes you buy. This guy preaches about how life is not hard and how everything will be okay, yet he grades his answers like a Nazi. If you're answer is not cookie cutter material it wont count. He is a delusional professor who does not follow what he preaches. Do not take this bum.
get stuff done early and you are golden. e.g. required research participation or papers if you dont wish to participate. so much easier to get done in the beginning of the term. also, go to lecture and you don't really have to read other than for a few discussion assignments
I like how the class is structured, and the material he talks about is inspirational.
Poor lecturer, very little of material discussed in class ends up on quizzes. 75% worth of grade is easy to attain, other 25 is made up of arbitrarily graded quizzes. Good for fulfilling nat science req but If you have a real interest in learning about psychology do not recommend.
Pretty cool guy. If you pay attention and make an effort to print out your notes for the exam its not hard to get a B+/A-. He does not give out A+ unless you go way above and beyond. Super good class for people who are interested in psychology and need a natural science requirement. All in all he's cool.
Takes his intro class way too seriously. Quizzes ask about the most specific word from his lectures that aren't on his slides.
The pop quizzes are boujee and he is a complete jerk off, to be honest. Everyone on here is boosting, and just take psych 111 without this professor lmfao
Only open note pop quizzes that are graded very harshly but not super difficult to get an A. Take detailed notes and always go to lecture or else you won't pass since he doesn't post the powerpoints online. He's a really good lecturer and makes the topic very interesting so I'm glad I took the class.
super funny teacher. The pop quizzes were petty hard and are graded very harshly so be ware, but atlas there aren't exams. Take extremely detailed notes, including all of the examples he references, because he does not post the slides and you can use your handwritten notes on the quizzes.
Great guy, and the class was pretty easy. I found his lectures a little difficult to follow at times and its a little inconvenient that lectures aren't posted. As long as you show up and take notes this class should be pretty straightforward, be prepared for those quizzes though as they can be challenging
Malley is one of the better professors I've had. Great sense of humor and manages to make lectures interesting. That being said, it's crucial you keep up with lectures and readings! The quizzes are unannounced (but he always drops a hint at least a lecture in advance) and the questions are mostly open ended. I wasn't prepared and ended up retaking.
All about the pop quizzes so basically you have to come to every single lecture to not miss one. They are open book, and only challenging if you don't pay attention or read beforehand. He is often absent for pain so you get a few days off but when he teaches he throws in a couple jokes, allows questions during lecture, and knows his stuff!
Quite possibly the easiest class I have taken.  Malley is an excellent professor.  He really enjoys teaching and has some pretty funny jokes to complement his lectures.  As long as you do all the work and pay attention, it should be hard not to get at least an A-.
Malley was the definition of fine. Psych 112 was not hard at all.  It was completely dependent on your GSI.  I had an amazing GSI so I lucked out.  Beware of pop quizzes they can be very tough even though they are open note. Rest for he class is cake and you're lucky cuz one quiz gets dropped
Class is mandatory and can't make up pop quizzes or assignments. Didnt learn much because a few classes he gave us tough readings and told us to go home without even teaching. Expected us to be prepared but often times was not himself. Unorganized.
DO NOT take this class at 830 am unless you know you'll get there. If you miss lectures you will likely miss pop-quizzes which count for a lot. Most assignments are due at the beginning of class. He does not accept ANY late work at all and if you miss a pop quiz or anything, too bad. Not the nicest guy but an okay class (if its not at 830).
Professor Malley is really nice and pretty funny. His syllabus is intimidating but reality is the class is very relaxed. He tries to make his lectures interesting. Your grade depends on pop quizzes so you have to show up. The discussion section is basically another lecture.
I took this class to fulfill my natural science requirement and I ended up loving it! not to hard but interesting material
Teacher name: Schreier, Shelly
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Prof Shreier is the professor I would love every one of my other professors to try to emulate. She has excellent examples for every concept and is extremely eager to help students succeed. Best professor at UMich
Her lectures are very engaging and fun. It's a shame that I always fell asleep in the crowded and hot MLB auditorium :( Also I have goldfish memory so this class was kinda challenging for me.
Her lectures were actually engaging. She uses a lot of fun videos and she always makes time after class to help you if you're struggling.
Dr. Schreier is definitely one of the best professors at Michigan. She truly cares about her students and makes it a point to express it during lectures. Her lectures are fun and interactive and the videos she shows are relevant and funny. I would not take Psych 111 with anyone but Schreier. She is awesome!
She's basically perfected Psych 111. Really entertaining in lecture, extremely fair about exams and assignments, and provides interesting material. Class is easy too.
Good content, very interesting and captivating info, but exams were a little tricky. I knew the information, but because there were so many terms, I would find myself at a loss trying to remember a certain word during an exam. I knew the concept, I could see it on the lecture slide, I remembered studying it, it just would not come to surface.
Dr. Schreier is one of the best professors I've ever had at UMich. I would definitely recommend taking this class with her to knock out some Social Science distribution credits.
Schreier is by far the best professor I have had at this university because she genuinely cares about her students and wants them to succeed. I may not have done the best in the class but going to her office hours so I could clarify questions and engage further with her teaching style helped. The sweetest person in the world. Take psych with her.
She is absolutely one of the best professor I have ever had, she cares about her students so much and she always prepares well for lecture. She gives out pretty easy exams and there are lots of extra credits.
Class is optional, but showing up to class is really important considering she tests you on videos you watch in class (and aren't on Canvas). Plus, paying attention in lecture is more than enough to guarantee you a decent grade.
She is an amazing lecturer, and also there is a lot of extra credit in case you mess up on an exam or something. But the exams are pretty easy if you actually study. Very straightforward. If you do the work, you get a good grade
Dr. Schreier is one of the best professors at Michigan. Caring, smart, funny, helpful - the list goes on! I wish she taught everything!! An overall great person and teacher :)
Very entertaining. Tests incredibly straightforward. Recommend to anybody doing pre-med
I waited a semester to take this class with her and it was 100% worth it. Make sure you take this class with her. It's very easy (do the extra credit that she offers) but you will actually learn so much too without even trying. She's absolutely adorable and genuinely cares about her students.
Schreier is a goat. She is the most reasonable professor and there are no discussions or homework other than 3 easy essays (literally got a 100% on all 3). She puts funny videos in the lecture from like the Office and stuff, it is really helpful to keep you engaged since the lecture is 2 hours long (the only thing I didn't like).DO THE EXTRA CREDIT
Dr. Schreier is the best possible professor for Psych 111. There are no discussion sections, so you're not at the mercy of a GSI or weekly quizzes. Her two hour lectures are a breeze and she gives LOTS of extra credit. If you read the slides beforehand and make a quizlet, you'll be fine.
She's a queen, don't take intro psych with anyone else. Very engaging and the sweetest person alive. Truly cares about her students. Do the papers, study, and you should be fine. It is just memorizing.
LOVE Professor Schreier. She made me want to pursue psychology. I genuinely enjoyed her lectures. She is great at keeping students engaged through the psychological methods she teaches. She leaves blanks in her slides, so it helps to have a friend in the class if you miss. I will look for any opportunity I get to take another class with her!
Scroll down. Read all the good reviews of her and they are spot on. Professor Schreier definitely made the exams more difficult this year. There are some problems that were not on text in the slides, but she discusses in class. Do the extra credit, listen, and answer the essays completely. You will get an A.
Definitely one of the best teachers at the University. Cares about her students so much, and offers a lot of extra credit. 3 short papers and 3 tests where she explain throughly how to complete them successfully. Really interesting lectures and you don't have to read the textbook. Pay attention to lectures and you will do great!
Teacher name: Gunderson, Brenda
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Amazing lectures
great professor
gunderson is so sweet and she does cartwheels! she tries to make things as clear as possible but they make the tests incredibly hard. make sure you get a good GSI who will review well for tests.
Dr. Gunderson is the ideal Stats 250 professor. Only some lectures are mandatory but go for extra credit. Dr. Gunderson says a lot of helpful things and stresses important ideas. If you have to take Stats 250, take it with her.
Brenda is an experienced &amp; intelligent professor. It is clear that she has been teaching this course for years, &amp; thus knows the best way to communicate relevant ideas. The only complaint would be that she speaks at an extraordinarily low volume, so that it is often difficult to hear her. Despite this, she is the best current Stats250 professor.
Gunderson is easily the best of the stats professors at Michigan. It doesnt matter at all what lecture you register for because you dont need to go throughout the semester. Just watch all of Gundersons lectures on Canvas a week before the exam and you will understand everything. She does a great job explaining and entertaining. (1.5x speed)
Gunderson is the queen of stats. She explains things clearly and in multiple ways if she sees mass confusion. Goes through examples thoroughly and seems to really care if her students are understanding the material. The class apparently used to be easier but now the exams are pretty rough.
Gunderson is great. Period. However, you need to be warned that there is no curve for the course. Over half of students got a C or less on an exam, and it still didn't matter. The grading is so meticulous that even one mistake will cost you an A. You would be smart to take Gunderson -- give yourself the best possible chance to do well if you can.
She is one of the best prof I have ever had, she always knows what she is talking about and she genuinely cares about her students,
DO NOT TAKE STATS250 UNLESS ITS GUNDERSON. I cannot emphasize this enough. the other profs make everything so complicated but Gunderson is a god send who makes everything so clear and records lectures. stopped showing up to my own class and watched hers, grade went from C to A.
Dr. Gunderson was a great prof. Knew the material perfectly and was the reason I attended her lectures at 830am. Very helpful outside of class too, and lots of extra credit opportunities if you attend lectures in person.
Super kind and she makes her lectures easy to understand. You can tell she really cares about teaching the class. The tests are a little tricky, but even just reviewing the notes will probably help you get 70% of the material down - the rest is just doing problem roulette or practice exams. Go to as many lectures as possible to get extra points.
Gunderson is revered as the best stats professor, and unfortunately that's true. Lectures are SO boring, especially if you've taken stats before. MLB3 is also definitely designed to make you sleep. You can barely miss anything on exams before your score tanks. Exams also line up closely to orgo exams, so be warned. Doable, but painful
she's a sweetheart
Took this class 2 years ago and I just remember how cute and fun she was. She personally writes congratulatory letters to those with high grades. Stats can be tricky, but if you take good notes and read exam questions carefully, you will get an A. I remember last day of class, she did a cartwheel. Really a sweet and cute teacher
This class would have been a nightmare without Gunderson. She explains concepts thoroughly and simply, and is willing to explain them in a different way if you ask. It's easy to lose points that add up on tests, so make sure you study as much as you can before each exam. She's very entertaining during class.
I didn't have Gunderson, but watching her lectures does wonders! Grades are majorly based on exams which are honestly not hard to study for but it is easy to miss points here and there. I definitely spent a good amount of hours reviewing before exams and don't think it is hard to pull at least a B/B+ on exams if you put time in before!
Gunderson is the best choice if you must take Stats 250. I would have done much worse in the class without her. She clearly communicates material that can be confusing. She also throws in entertaining slides about her family, vacations, etc. Now and again she does a cartwheel. And she includes lots of exam review in lecture, which is a bonus.
STATS 250 is most definitely no longer a blow off class like it once used to be. Even doing practice exam after practice exam and studying for hours for exams, I can only manage to get Bs on the tests. The content isn't anything difficult, but the tests are extremely nitpicky for no reason. However, Gunderson is very sweet and helpful.
Stats is not the class for me (love the material, can't perform well on exams making up most of the grade). That being said, I loved going to class with Brenda. She is so sweet, so intelligent, and very good at lecturing. Takes time to go through the material so that nobody feels left behind, lets class out 5-10 mins early, and is very easygoing
Teacher name: Winn, Dave
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
The class is laid out kind of weird because they know engineers need to pass it. Saying that, you only need to get like an average of 44% on quizzes and do half the homework to pass. Doing better than just passing is very hard. Also very hard quizzes every other week make it very stressful. Lectures are awesome though, love dave winn
Dave Winn is by far my favorite professor at the University of Michigan. He's lectures are both very intense and extremely hilarious!
I thought he was a decent professor, but I wouldn't say amazing or anything. This might be because persoanlly I wasn't really a fan of the subject matter he taught to begin with, but his explanations often confused me more, and the quizzes were unnecessarily stressful.
Dr. Winn is the best professor I've ever had at Michigan. He makes the toughest engineering prerequisite a course that you actually want to take and show up for lecture. He's very understanding and accessible outside of class; however, the class itself is very, very tough. Be ready to study a lot.
Dave Winn is probably a good professor, but Physics 240 is impossible at Umich. The lectures have little to nothing to do with quizzes, and homework problems are never tested on. Most of the content is learned on your own. Dave is a friendly, funny guy though.
Winn is honestly a good professor, I just personally struggle with Physics and he intentionally makes the quizzes very hard. If I was a Physics or Engineering major, I would probably love him, but as someone who is just trying to pass the class, it's pretty tough.
Makes class enjoyable and explains very well. Incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the topics
Professor Winn was an excellent professor, covering a lot of material quickly and clearly. That said, I wish I had taken multivariable calculus before taking this class rather than at the same time. This course requires a lot of work and the quizzes don't necessarily reflect the homework assignments, so the practice quizzes and roulette are key.
A very good lecturer who teaches the topics well and focuses on the conceptual background. Also he has a lot of great demonstrations, which help give the content a real world connection, something more inherently difficult in 240.
Solid choice. Very clear instructor. His jokes are the amazing part of this class (but people seem to not get those all the time)
One of my favorite professors. Wore sandals and the same shorts everyday which I loved. Class is hard and sometimes he puts really hard questions on exams and doesn't realize it but overall a great guy and great lecturer. Also can't move well. Jokes are hilarious.
Professor Winn is, without question, the worst professor I've ever had at the University of Michigan. He's scattered and can not clearly present relevant material. The textbook is the only thing that stopped me from failing. Take 405 with literally anyone else. I'm pretty sure I understand less having finished the course than I did after 260.
Winn is an amazing lecturer, and the perfect mix between funny and awkward. Quizzes can be hard, but the lowest grade is dropped and there is lots of extra credit available. If you do enough Problem Roulette and don't cheat with iClickers, you can get an A.
Fantastic lecturer. Professor Winn constantly makes the class laugh. He also does a great job of making highly complex physics concepts seem immensely simpler. If you are about to take Physics 240, I HIGHLY recommend you take it with Professor Winn. Plus he always wears socks and chacos, which is undoubtedly the greatest outfit in existence.
This guy could be the most awkward professor I've had to date, but he's an incredible lecturer. Probably one of the few collegiate lectures actually worth going to without additional incentives.
Great lecturer. The grading in his class is based on only 6 quizzes, with the lowest quiz grade dropped. There is extra credit for showing up to class and answering iClicker questions as well as doing the homework.
He is by far the most amazing professor I ever have at UofM. He is very caring about his students and want us to get As in the class. He is very helpful during the i-clickers and try to help us as much as possible. He is funny, generous, and has a cute sense of fashion. Physics 240 is supposed to be a hard class but he makes it worth it.
I wasn't a fan of Professor Winn.  Even though he's funny during lecture, his teaching is always heavy on the theoretical material and he never covers any problems with math (which is what most of the homework/exams is based on).  Only good part of this class is that the extra credit can significantly raise your grade (brought me from B+ to A).
Prof Winn's jokes and quirky personality made 9am lecture worth it. The material is tough, but you'll do well if you start your hw early and go to office hours (camp out in the Physics Help Room). He recommends doing Problem Roulette to study, but I redid the hw &amp; lecture slides. DO THE PRELECTURES! easy points + makes life SO much easier trust me
Overall he's a really solid professor. He's funny and makes jokes in class but also covers the material thoroughly and at a good pace. He has very strict grading criteria which he clearly lays out at the beginning of the term but he also has no leeway for bumping up grades
Teacher name: Coppola, Brian
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Absolutely incredible. Probably the best teacher I've ever had in my life. Not only does he explain the material in an engaging and clear way, but he is also willing to answer questions beyond the syllabus, which has helped me understand many concepts better. He also only uses the chalkboard, which I found much more interesting than powerpoints.
Incedible lecturer, explained organic chemistry in a way that even my parents would understand. Very accessible and helpful for outside of class questions. Related the material to every day life and made it seem relevant and interesting.
Coppola is a nice guy, but he is very fast and assumes you already know a lot about the topic. That being said, he clearly loves his job and is so on top of his work. He responds to emails almost instantly and is very punctual. He does not give out answers to the coursepack, but there are practice exams on nolta's website you can use.
He cares incredibly much for his students and is always energetic during lectures. During the office hours before the exam, he stayed waaaay past the the regular hours and answered every single question though it was really late. Coppola is extremely admirable and teaches in a way that is succinct and, as much as orgo can be, interesting!
The best chemistry professor on campus period. Organic chemistry is hard, but his explanations are detailed and thorough. Remember to use multiple sources of information, including your peers and textbook. There's a lot of work to do, but you're in good hands. He's definitely a role model for anyone who learns from him.
Coppola is a good professor but he isn't always clear in the way he presents the material, going in depth on things that aren't relevant. A few general notes about orgo it takes WORK, stay on top of the material and do ALOT of practice exams if you want an "A", also get your questions answered and don't hold on to misconceptions. Good luck!
He's really helpful, he looks strict but he's actually nice.
I thought Orgo would be very hard, but Coppola's straightforward and logical lectures made the material itself seem not so hard. Amazing professor. He always incorporated real world examples into lecture which was cool. If you follow along in lecture, do the course pack, and put in time for studying you will be fine.
Brian is an extraordinarily intelligent, dedicated, &amp; experienced professor. If Brian says it, it will be covered by the exam; his lectures are succinct &amp; he does not stray from the subject matter. Brian uses examples that explain difficult concepts quickly and make them easy to remember. If you have a choice between professors, choose Brian.
Coppola lectures can be boring, but he covers only topics that will possibly be on exams (unlike other profs), as well they are recorded and posted to his website. The class is inherently difficult, but joining a SLC study group and doing about 5 hours of studying outside of that before exams will allow you to do well.
Out of all the profs for organic chemistry, Coppola is def the best choice. Then again, I must warn you that I basically thought he was speaking a different language by the end of the semester. This class is by far the hardest class I have ever taken, and I hope I never have to go through something this terrible again
Coppola is an AMAZING lecturer. He writes the exams too, so being in his class is probably for the best. Lectures are recorded so attendance in class isn't mandatory. He's probably a genius.
If you want to do well in this class, dont do noltas exams (way too difficult, her pages in the coursepack are in text font arial). Dont get too attached to lecture. They usually are the justification for the answers. Coppola writes very fair exams with an occasional trick here and there.
Dr. Coppola was an inspiration. He convinced me to join the honors study group, and that is how I met most of my friends at the university. I didn't know how much I would enjoy organic chemistry because I've always liked physical chemistry better, but one semester after taking Coppola's class, I became involved in organic chemistry research!
Literally the best professor at UM. He's funny and says random jokes at times. He's like the funny uncle everyone wished they had. He has such a clear and distinct voice that grabs attention so lectures are never boring. I wish he would teach other chem classes so I could take his class again.
He's good and all, but i don't understand why he sells course packs. They could easily be available online like calc's and physic's practice exams... They're just old exam questions, so it's not like he's slaving over these things. A little scammy if you ask me. Only gripe though, so i guess that's good?
Coppola was alright. He tended to go fast during lectures, and only covered the most difficult material 2 or 3 days before the exam. Fortunately, Chem 210 has countless resources that help you. Tough class, but put the effort in and you will do well.
Professor Coppola has been my favorite professor so far and teaches chemistry so well. He is very clear and always makes sure to answer questions during class, after class, or in office hours. I had his class at 8am and he always kept my attention and was very captivating. I would highly recommend taking his class if you can.
Amazing person and professor. Really knows how to teach. Funny. Kind of fast sometimes but his lectures are recorded so you can re-watch. For the first two exams he covered the hard material really late (2 days before the exam) so it's better to be ahead and allow time to practice.
Coppola is honestly an amazing professor. He teaches chemistry so well and everything in his lectures is extremely clear. Truthfully, you don't even really have to go to lecture because his lectures are recorded and he posts a panoramic shot of the chalkboard. Don't believe the scary things you hear about orgo; it's honestly not that bad.
Teacher name: Hogan, Chad
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Chad is laid back and clearly goes above and beyond to help students understand the material. He does not make lecture attendance mandatory and posts slides online, but I would still go. There are only 4 problem sets throughout the term and exams are easy to prepare for if you do the homework properly. Overall, a solid 300 level econ elective.
I can understand why Professor Hogan gets an unfavorable reputation. However, he really cases about making sure his students understand the content and makes sure that he is available as a resource when needed. He is incredibly accessible. His exams are graded harshly, but that is because they are straightfoward and contain already covered content.
I honestly hated chad as a lecturer (VERY boring), but loved him as a person. I put in very minimal effort and still did well. The material is simple, just sitting through lectures is the hard part. His tests are very, very straight forward.
Chad Hogan unlike most other professors cares that you understand the material. He does not ask you cram complicated formulas but rather understand and apply them. In exams his questions are similar to that he gives in his assignments so you know whats expected of you. If you want an A go to lecture but more importantly use his office hours.
Just go to class and you'll be fine. There's no discussion but office hours with Chad are very helpful and he can clear up course content on a more personal level.
101 is light work and hogan is better than the other lectures. The curve is huge. If you don't get a B don't continue with Econ its not his fault you suck
mad chill, just go to office hours. he really cares about 300 level course and he really wants his students to do well. He is a totally reasonable guy and I would definitely recommend his 300 level class
You can tell that Chad really cares about what he is lecturing on. Attending class in optional, but you definitely need to go to pass. He is very accessible outside of class and even encourages students to text him with any questions. Make sure you go to his office hours!! He'll work with you until you have the right answers on assignments
He is not as bad as what most students ranked him on rate my prof. In fact, i would argue that he is extremely caring and accessible outside of class. He even gave out his work phone number for students to access him. I believe he is more helpful in office hours than in class. Chad is the man!!!
Going to lecture and discussion is pretty much useless. His lectures are very boring and he never gets through the whole lecture. But with that said, he's not as bad as everyone makes him out to be, most people hate him because they don't put any effort in. The material is pretty easy so if you actually take the time to learn it, you'll do fine.
An easy A would not take you so much time.
Econ310 is almost the *exact* same content from Econ102, with maybe 3-4 lectures on new content. Hogan is a good professor but his lecture-style is definitely geared towards "auditory-learners" because he goes through maybe 4 slides per class. Exams are really easy as well.
For the first two exams, it is fine if you read the textbook and see his slides. But for the final exam, go to his office hour and ask about the questions in sample exam that you don't know how to solve! But beware that his lectures are extremely boring and hard to concentrate. You have to learn by yourself, but he is willing to help in office hour
The course is 90% exams and 10% homework, so if you think you are good at this topic, take him. The exams are not difficult. Otherwise, no. His lectures were dry and boring. I learned mostly through reading the textbook and going over slides on my own. If you want to do well in his class, go to his office hours and he is willing to help.
Chad is a nice guy and very willing to help outside of class, however, I found myself before exams using youtube to teach myself all of the content. I enjoy econ and think I'm not bad at it but Chad's tests proved otherwise. There are teachers at Umich that will be significantly better for getting a better grade and increasing your understanding.
Hogan somewhat deservedly gets a bad rep. His lectures are boring and unhelpful and his tests are hard af. Having said that, he's great one-on-one. Go by his office hours at least a couple times, otherwise going you'll be floating by without actually understanding any of the material.P.S. Discussion sections don't matter aside from Part B of exams.
Chad is not the most horrible professor ever, but he's not great either. He spends too much time on one subject and explains things strangely. Be sure to read and do the homework for understanding. His class is way harder than the other 101's at UM. However, he really does care and puts so much effort into helping you if you just ask.
I took Econ 101 with Hogan and my first week of school, a 5th year Econ Major friend told me that he had dropped Hogan after 2 weeks of class and warned me to do the same...I should have listened. The absolute worst lecturer I have ever had. Redundant, slow paced, and focused on simple topics in class, leaving us confused about actual exam content.
Worst thing I have to say about professor hogan are his lectures. While hes easy to understand when I try listening, it does take effort to focus for the entire lecture because he is a bit on the dry side. However, he definitely is an intelligent guy and you can tell he tries to make things as clear as possible
His lectures are terribly dry and boring. I didn't go to lecture once. Just read the slides before the exams, take practice exams, do homework and you will be fine. Do not go to lecture or you will fall asleep. He spends like 30 minutes on one slide where I can knock out a slide at home for like 5 minutes. Class is fair, just bad professor.

Teacher comments: 
I took Bio 173, a 2 credit lab, this semester and this class has taken more of my time than any of the other classes I am taking. The work required to get a decent grade in this class is ridiculous.
Absolutely terrible. Is unprepared for lectures and doesn't actually teach you any material- he reads off of a PDF with vague bare-minimum info and then tests you on specifics that you have to somehow find on your own. He held an exam review and someone asked what would be on the exam and he just goes: um, some questions about plants.
This class is out of 200 points. Completely GSI dependent, and some of them grade very harshly. The essays are tough but doable, if you go to office hours and make sure you ask your GSI what to include you should be okay. The presentations aren't bad, but the first one is graded much tougher. Get a hold of previous quizzes, they were very similar
This class is very GSI based. Marc is a terrible grader -- expects us to know things that were not covered in class, etc. If you get a good GSI, say hello to an easy A, but if not, work as hard as possible. The structure of the class is terrible -- too much work in the last two weeks and barely anything for the entire beginning of the semester.
I understand that a college lab is not supposed to be easy A+ for everybody who shows up. But this was wayyyyy too much work for a 2 credit intro bio lab. Essentially, there is 2-3 months of absolutely nothing, then you are slammed with a paper, presentation, and exam all in a week. Can't work on them earlier because you need to wait for the data.
Horrible, very disrespectful too. In "quiz review" he refused to give out practice questions / old quizzes and was snarky to students who were asking questions and didn't understand material
For a 2 credit lab class, Bio 173 is a lot of work. There are 2 papers, 2 group presentations and 2 tests. The material seems a bit too in-depth for a simple intro bio lab course. You will probably feel lost if you haven't taken or aren't currently taking 171&amp;172. He's a good prof (and is super helpful one-on-one) just a very tough grader.
2 presentations, 2 four page papers, 2 exams (midterm/final), prelabs (that are strictly graded). How is this a 2 credit class? The professor is fine, but he makes the GSIs grade strictly. I thought we did great on our presentation, but only got an 80%. They take pre lab points off too if you're not specific enough or don't have particular wording
He said there wouldnt be procedure questions of mol bio for quiz 1 but there were! They were questions about what we would throw out for PCR and column chromotagraphy.
The class is out of 200 points. The quizzes are extremely difficult and bombing one quiz makes it impossible for an A
Dr. Ammerlaan is a nice person, that much is clear. But the lectures are not clear. The "quizzes" are the worst. They really are more like exams. A lot of information not on notes or in the modules are put on the exam. It's all dependent on your GSI.
Not good. Doesn't tell you what to study for quizzes or give any practice ones. hope you have a nice GSI like i did.....
take with dif prof if you can...
Incredibly boring lecture where he reads off the canvas document. Class completely dependent on GSI. he occasionally gives answers to prelab/quiz in lecture so kinda helpful, but if you can get a friend to get those notes then dont go
Lectures are extremely boring and dull. Class is heavily dependent on the GSI which could be a good or bad thing.
Ive had him for 173 lab as well and it was fine. I was terrified of genetics but it really was not bad even as an accelerated class. I suggest reading not all the assigned sections before lecture. If you do that the concepts stick much better. (Tip: winter term genetics is brutal. Choose either summer or winter)
It's a bummer to see most of the reviews are from Bio 173, as that class, no matter whom you have for a prof is... less than fun. That said, MC Ammer is a great prof. He's fun, engaging, and rather pleasant, despite reading off of his lecture notes verbatim often. Exams are hard, but if you're good at multiple choice, you won't have any trouble.
Not impressed with him at all. Lab lecture became a waste of time by the end of the semester. His GSI's were never on the same page as him, and I would get two different answers for the same question between him and my GSI. Class is mostly based on your lab GSI, mine was awful
Super boring lecture, didn't go unless there was a quiz or paper to turn in. Labs themselves are taught by GSIs; I really liked my GSI and she made an effort to be accessible outside of class and was kind, caring, and made the labs the best they could be. Ammerlaan is not a great lecturer, doesn't add anything to the class.
Ammerlaan is a good man. he rearranged our quiz time when there was a shooting threat bc he didn't want us to feel nervous while taking the exam. He knows what he is talking about, and applies common themes from bio 171 and 172 in a way that makes sense in the lab. Projects and tests are kinda hard, but manageable. Overall good class.
Teacher name: Kerner, Nancy
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Lab reports were tedious. Doing well on lab reports can be challenging. Look them over carefully. My group did well on presentations. For exams, watch her review lectures, do all practice exams, and go to GSI office hours to completely understand questions you missed and exams will be easy. Her lectures were helpful to me.
The class is hard if you get a bad group/bad GSI but Nancy is actually fine. She held helpful reviews before the exam and put up a ton of practice tests that end up being 90% of the actual test.
Listening to Nancy's voice in lecture is comparable to having your fingernails pulled out one by one. The GSIs grade incredibly harsh and if your lab group isn't bright and organized, you're screwed. If you don't have to take this course, avoid it at all costs.
A lot of work for a pointless class. If you take this class, pray that you get a decent lab group. Do all the practice exams, otherwise the hourly exams will shred you.
Her grading/extra credit system is awful. The GSIs are unnecessarily harsh and get in trouble if they're too nice, and often are not helpful. The lab manual (written by her) is often misleading and contains many typos. This class is ridiculous and I feel that we deserve more than 2 credits for all the work we put in.
This class was incredibly difficult. Nancy Kerner was not helpful at all, and the GSIs are useless; they can't tell you anything, and they mark you down hugely for small mistakes &amp; sometimes for no reason other than that the class average must be at a certain percent (if you ask what you did wrong, they don't respond). To do well, ace your exams.
The lectures are helpful for knowing what to do in the lab, though the extra credit for the class is unfairly given. The lab manual is confusing.
I got very close to a hundred percent on both exams, and I did not receive an A in the class.  This class is trivial and useless.
Kerner helps with nothing. The labs don't relate to the lectures at all. If you're not confident with chemistry, go to lecture to get the extra credit, but other than that it's pretty useless.
Chem 125 is a miserable class. Kerner is knowledgeable and seems reasonably nice, but lectures are boring and useless when it comes to lab. You have no real guidance in lab (GSIs aren't allowed to tell you much) and you put in way more work than the two credits are worth. The lab reports are graded extremely harshly.
Very technical and not very clear.
After the first week you realize she doesnt help with anything so I just stopped going to her lecture
Terrible professor. Labs have no correlation and she is rude when answering your questions. Advice: Her past exams are identical to her exams.
The class is almost more work than the Chemistry 130 portion of gen chem, and is only worth 2 credits. Definitely not worth my time. Too bad it is mandatory.
Nancy Kerner seems monotonous only if you sit in the back. In the front row, she is sassy and funny and a great professor. You just have to pay attention.
One of the worst professors I've had so far. This course is ruined so much by her. The labs have no correlation to the exams at all. Basically you do the labs just to do them and for the exam, you learn everything on your own through trends on practice exams. Nothing is learned from this class, you just memorize. Completely useless class
Worst lab ever with a boring monotone teacher. The lectures are not mandatory or useful, unless you are a chem major then maybe they are. The class focuses on teaching you 3-5 rules that are results of your experiments and to ace the exam one simple needs to memorize those rules. Lectures are long winded ways of explaining them, so no need to go
Pretty boring and dry professor, but seems like a nice person
Her lectures were not helpful what so ever. I went to only one all semester and passed the class with ease. She talks like a robot and it's not worth going to her lecture.
Overall, Chem 125 can be a pain because of all the group work involved. As a professor, Kerner isn't as bad as everyone makes her out to be. While her lectures are very boring, they are also very clear. Labs are very, very difficult to perform/understand without them. If you go to lecture and use the practice exams, you should get a good grade.
Teacher name: Gottfried, Amy
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
This is the most challenging class I have taken at Michigan. With that said, the work is incredibly rewarding and you will learn chemistry on a deep level. During the class you will be very frustrated at times, but when it is over there is a definite sense of pride and accomplishment for persevering. Make sure to do the PREP!
Dr. Gottfried is a great lecturer and she puts more time into helping students learn chemistry concepts than any other professor I've had. Lots of people are put off immediately by her exams but that's because they test your reading skills and ability to pull information out just as much as your chemistry knowledge but that's what the PREP is for.
PChem is a difficult class no doubt. But Dr. Gottfried is always very willing to answer questions, whether in office hours or on Piazza. Her tests are difficult, her coursepack is challenging, but I've learned so much from this experience. You will be trained to work really hard in this class and will be pushed to your limit but you will grow!
She is one of the best lecturers I've had at this school. Her exams are pretty tough but she gives "improvement" extra credit points, you only need 75% on iClicker, and the class is a curved scale. She records OH and answers literally every single Piazza post. She really wants students to do well. MUST DO PREP SHE POSTS (w/ the key) TO DO WELL.
She's very approachable and her lectures are clear. Since there isn't really a textbook for this class, you have to make an effort to attend the lectures. The exams are pretty hard but she gives you a lot of resources (practice tests, etc.) to study from.
Lectures are elementary compared to her rigorous exams. I recommend NOT taking this with any other difficult courses. Despite providing a ton of great resources for practice and feedback, a large sum of time is dedicated to do well. Attendance isn't mandatory but clicker points can be used for those who don't want their grade to be 100% exam-based.
This class is the worst class I've ever endured. There are 7 extremely difficult exams, with the final being cumulative. Gottfried is a good lecturer, but her lecture material is extremely basic compared to her exams and she choses for it to be this way. The stress level created for this class is too much to handle for any student due to the exams.
The lectures cover at most 10% of the material on the exams, so most of exam preparation has to be done on your own. Homework is useless because it is not even 5% as difficult as the exam. By the way there are 7 exams for this one class! She explains material well after class but the exams always have new material that very few know how to solve.
She's alright. Super nice and approachable, but this is honestly one of the hardest classes I've taken here. PREP is the only way to actually prepare for exams. I understand it's difficult to explain such complex concepts, but lectures often felt a bit barebones. You'll learn a lot, just be prepared to work
This course is difficult but there is no other instructor that I would have taken this class with except Dr. Gottfried. She is super approachable and really dedicated to helping you do well. She explains the material well but of course wants to challenge you to succeed so don't expect an easy A. Be prepared to work hard and don't give up.
Yes, the class is time consuming and difficult, but Dr. Gottfried gives amazingly clear lectures. I would 10/10 take a class with her again!
Gottfried's exams are extremely difficult. The material she teaches in lecture gives you the base for what you need to know, then through a lot of PREP practice and self-study you start to learn what she'll ask on exams. She does want everyone to succeed, and she gives a lot of her time for that. Use Piazza and office hours as much as you can!
Gottfried is approachable and makes sure you understand the material. There's lots of office hours and if you post on Piazza she responds very quickly. However, her lectures/homework are NOT representative of exams AT ALL. Be prepared to rage while doing the PREP and rage again at the exams because they are wayyyyy harder than any lecture material.
Dr. Gottfried is an incredible professor. Although this is debatably the hardest pre-med class at the University of Michigan, she explains everything in a way that makes sense. She seems to genuinely want her students to succeed. That being said, her exams are extremely difficult, but she does curve them. Would not take Pchem with any other prof.
She's a stellar professor, and although it's true that the exams will likely push you beyond your limits, you can do well in the class. You get one exam's worth of points for midterm improvement, homework, and discussion as a buffer. Also, PREP is divided into sections by topic, so start the problems as soon as something is discussed in lecture.
While Gottfried appears to be nice superficially, her exams are simply too difficult, and the class is even worse than orgo in that she teaches you extremely easy barebones stuff, and you literally teach yourself essentially everything else. There is really no point in paying for this course when I have legitimately taught myself all the material.
Gottfried is the only thing that made PChem bearable. She's one of the most committed professors on campus and wants to help her students. Her exams are extremely difficult, but she holds so many office hours to help us understand the material. This would probably be my least favorite course if any other professor taught it.
One of my favorite professors at Michigan. She teaches clearly and makes lecture engaging. She provides tons of opportunities to ask questions in person and online, and always makes a point to be thorough, as well as make sure all students have the opportunity to ask their questions. Dr. G's class took heavy commitment but was extremely rewarding.
Dr. Gottfried teaches you how to mature in your thinking.  Every PChem topic has some key concepts, all of which are relatively easy to learn by doing practice problems, but the exams require you to solve problems of unprecedented difficulty to apply those concepts. She wants you to do well, and you can. Take a deep breath &amp; ask for help if need be
Great professor, really cares about chemistry and her students. She makes it clear what you have to do to succeed. She writes some tough exam questions, but gives you plenty of practice to prepare. Surprised she doesn't have a higher ranking.
Teacher name: Peters-Golden, Holly
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Holly Peters-Golden is by far the highlight of my freshman year. Not only are her lectures interesting and engaging, but she gives a study guide for each test that outlines exactly what you need to study and every test adheres to it. She tells amazing stories that relate to her lectures and she is truly an amazing speaker. She's the best!
Honestly, her Medical Anthro class is amazing. You don't have to go to lecture but I go every week because its so interesting and you actually learn a lot. You also watch a lot of movies but they aren't bad and you do get to know a lot about the world.
Very talented speaker. Attendance isnt mandatory but im constantly inspired to listen to her teach. Important to note that you watch a movie/documentary for like 40% of lectures. Exams are not super easy (almost entirely short answer) but are still pretty fair
Dr. Peters-Golden really knows her stuff on anthropology. Her lectures are incredibly funny and she is a very engaging speaker. You can do well in this class by simply attending lectures.
Professor Peters-Golden, is amazing in class. She delivers informative and interesting lectures through a story telling method. You will no doubt do well by just attending lectures. Peters-Golden is super inspiring but be aware. You will be graded on few things. Additionally, her overhead slides are very simplified. SO DO NOT SKIP CLASS!!
Professor is really interesting with her lectures and its clear that she cares about her students and about anthropology. It's really fun listening to her stories and then actually seeing them on the test. She tries her best to make things interesting for us. I was actually sad on the last day of lectures!
Professor Peters-Golden makes every lecture interesting and has a ton of funny anecdotes that she ties into every class. There is a review sheet for each exam, which helps a lot. Also, you can get by without buying the textbook, as long as you attend the lectures.
Dr. Peters-Golden is amazing! So eloquent and funny, and her lectures and films are usually pretty interesting. Something to be aware of though is that this is a very lecture heavy class, where important concepts aren't always on the overheads or mentioned. It takes some getting used to but overall very insightful class would take again.
I can't say enough good things about Prof. Peters-Golden. VERY caring and wants her students to succeed. 258 is a seminar on culture and medicine. Prof P-G is VERY knowledgeable and imparts intellect when she speaks. Accessible outside of class and willing to help. Definitely take 258 if you're pre-med. Good background for culture &amp; biomedicine
Peters-Golden is one of my favorite lecturers at UM. Doesn't use slides, which takes getting used to, but class involves a film every other lecture, which is great. Graded based on a paper, 2 exams, and section. Tells great stories and has a wonderful sense of humor. For a 300 level class, workload is SO manageable and interesting. Must take class
The format of the class takes some getting used to but I grew to love it. Every lecture felt like Dr. Peters-Golden was just kind of telling some stories but in a good way. You absolutely have to attend class and take good notes because there are no recordings or slides to look ateverything is verbal. Exams are not bad at all if you pay attention.
Professor Peters-Golden is a super involved and entertaining lecturer! I think she's caught onto the fact that her class is thought of as an "easy A", so tests were more difficult than expected. If you go to lecture and listen, you can really get by with just studying the day before. Never used the textbook, but get the novel and culture sketches.
BEWARE: No longer a blow-off class!! Go to lecture, take notes, utilize the GSI-led exam review sessions before each test. Tests are straightforward and fair, but grading is very picky on the short answer and essay sections.
She clearly was interested in what she was talking about, and she had plenty of personal anecdotes to help explain the topics. Make sure you go to class though, because those anecdotes may appear on the exam. Exam 1 was difficult, but she and the GSIs made a conscious effort to make the next two easier and better prepare us.
Holly Peters-Golden is by far my favorite professor I have ever had. I have taken 3 classes with her, and loved all 3. She is so wise and intelligent, and her stories make class so much fun! Everyone who took this class was sad for it to end, and wished we could take it again! All you have to do is read and participate in discussion everyday
Lectures were boring &amp; I feel like I learned nothing new, but dont expect to skip lectures &amp; do well on the tests unless you put in the time to study (from Quizlet, review sheet, discussion notes, &amp; readings). I got by without the textbook, but needed Getting Ghost for the essay &amp; the Culture Sketches, which appeared in written questions on exams.
Kind of annoyingly rehearsed lectures, but she tells good stories and gives you all the material. Read culture sketches for the tests, but fairly straightforward exams. One paper assignment off of a chapter book you read on your own.
Peters-Golden is by far the most annoying professor I have ever encountered. I don't know how she has such a high rating. For the lecture on Primates, she brought in a Curious George stuffed doll and continued the entire lecture as if it were one of the books. She's patronizing and her stories are obnoxious. The lectures were painful and cringy.
Pretty clear lecturer. Tests are a little more specific than the other sections, so if you're looking for an easy A and dont want to go to lecture take them, but if you just go to lectures (dont need to do readings) you'll be fine. Her lectures are pretty interesting, and if you take basic notes w/ examples you should be able to get an easy A.
Definitely not as easy as the other anthro professors. If you are taking this class for an easy R&amp;E, take it with someone else or P/F. Easy B+, will make you work for it if you want the GPA boost.

Jason Daida was my first engineering professor at U of M. He challenged my peers and I to extend ourselves beyond our comfort zones in order to achieve greatness. Beyond the content of the course, he helped me to think outside of the box when solving problems. This ultimately helped me on my journey through my next 3.5 at U of M. RIP.
RIP, one of the most inspirational and caring professors I will probably ever have the honor of studying under.
I would not recommend Daida at all.  He is not helpful, especially if you have no previous programming experience.
He can be a little quirky in lecture, but he tries to make class fun and interesting. Assignments weren't difficult especially with GSI/piazza help. Tests were open book/open note. He supplied his own textbook online. All the lectures and examples were also online.
It is a lot of work for this class, but I have never had a better professor. Many professors simple "lecture", while Daida "teaches". Not directly tho. During the year you will hate how much work you have to do, but afterwards you will really appreciate what he tried to teach you.
This guy is a good professor but your grade depends more on teamwork. Roughly half of your grade is based on teamwork and if you get stuck with a bad team then you're f*cked. I'd suggest taking another section
Helpful professor, charming and appealing, gives the best class ever.
Dr. Daida is amazing! You will definitely learn a lot from him and walk away from the class happy you put in such a great amount of effort. As long as you are willing to step outside of your comfort zone and learn something new and exciting this class will definitely be beneficial to you no matter what Engineering field you're pursuing!
Amazing class and really helpful, unlike any other lectures. Def. recommend.
Really helpful and intreasting
Really helpful and intreasting
i was extremely scared for engineering 101 because i had NO prior experience with computer programming. however, i felt like daida was able to simplify things in a more understandable manner. assignments are time-consuming so start IN ADVANCE. midterms are reasonable, open-book/note. office hours saved me.
Pretty bad teacher. He doesn't post your grades so you don't know how you're actually doing in the class. Took over a week to get my final grade. I found some of his sample code that he gives out on his website to be wrong. Puts too much emphasis on theory and style than actual coding. If you have a choice go with Ringenburg, not Daida.
Wouldn't wish this class on my worst enemy. Waste of time. Nice guy, would take him for any other subject, but this class was poorly constructed and highly uninteresting.
The worst teacher I have ever had.  The worst when it comes to grading, the worst with conveying his ideas, and the lectures have little to do with each other, or at least he doesnt explain the connection well.  He also has a huge ego
Daida knows what's up. I've never heard of matlab, in fact I've never even looked at code. He changed the way I think about things, much more linear and logical. I think I'm going to further my programming knowledge because of his class and I might even do CSE. I learned a lot even though half the lecture was about random stuff.
Hardest class I took as a freshmen, but also way more interesting and important than the other sections of ENGR 100.  You WILL start feeling anti-Daida angst by the end, though
Dr. Daida is a professor that is very fun to watch in lecture, but at the same time, he gives a LOT of work. If you are looking for a experience that you will never forget, this is the class, but if you are looking for an easy way to get by the engr100 requirement, take something else..
This professor is perfect.
Dr. Daida is a wonderful professor, but he expects a lot of the student. While I highly recommend this class (Engr 100 - Design and the Real World), I warn any potential takers of the workload: it's a lot of work, mainly teamwork. With that said, I will never forget this class or this professor.
Teacher name: Sipowska, Jadwiga
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
A decent professor overall. She gives a lot of useful examples during lectures but makes you feel like an idiot for asking questions. Chem 130 is a difficult class to begin with and Professor Sipowska didn't really make it any more or less difficult.
Dottie is a very intelligent person and means well in her work. The lectures are very fast and detailed. Unless you pay close attention in lectures and work hard outside of class, your chances of passing are fairly low.
Sipowska isn't the worst teacher I've ever had, but I wouldn't recommend her either.
Dotie understands the material and the structure of Chem 130 very well.  However, she often doesn't give helpful or detailed answers to questions that students have. The iClicker questions are incredibly helpful in determining how well you understand the information, but it makes attendance mandatory and they're often "trick" questions.
She is incredibly hard to understand and does not explain the subject well at ALL. If we get Iclicker questions wrong, she blames it one us. Avoid her at all cost.
20-30 pgs of reading for every lecture. Lectures usually had 3-9 iclicker questions, some of which were tough. Often  than 50% of the class would get a question right, and she would ask "why did you get that wrong?". Went to every class, did all the reading, homework, clickers, failed every exam... I was in the slc group too. Print lecture notes!
Chem 130 is a pretty hard class, but Dottie is a pretty funny lady. She can be hard to understand, she does have an accent and speaks quietly. She's pretty fair with the clicker question, if the percentage that gets it right is pretty low she'll go over it as a class and re-open the question.
Dotie definitely knew what she was talking about when it comes to this subject; however, she is very unclear, and she does not make it any easier when you have a question. Exams are very hard, too.
Great professor! Teaches the material very thoroughly and prepares you well for the exam. I advise doing problem roulette as well.
You have to read the chapter before going to class - reading assignment clicker questions will be tough if you don't know someone with the answers. Course material isn't too difficult, but keep up because what makes the class hard is the amount of material you're expected to know. She's a good professor and will answer questions if you ask.
I found her lectures completely useless and confusing. I played games on my phone the entire time. DO the OWLS, read the book, do problem roulette and ask for help if you don't understand. Her office hours are annoying though, way to many people. Test are hard I gave up studying on most of them
Reading the book and doing the OWLs are crucial to passing and preparing for the tests. The iClicker questions are very tricky, so read the material before class.
Do the OWLs and read before lecture. Her notes are very clear and easy to follow. She has good sense of humor and she likes to use it. The exams are not too bad if you do problem roulette before. Weekly quizzes are really dependent on your GSI. I took the CSP section so the GSIs were great. Attendance isn't mandatory but you get iClicker points.
She has clearly been teaching for a long time, and, if you pay attention, she will make sure you are aware of everything you must do to get a good grade.
As my professor for the summer term of 2015, she was a fairly good lecturer. She does not particularly stand out as amazing, but nevertheless her understanding of the material is solid, her lectures well planned and presented, and her engagement with the students enough to keep her students from falling asleep for more than a few minutes.
I absolutely dreaded going to this class. It was obvious that Dodie was trying, but she is just not a good teacher. Nice lady, bad instructor.
I did well on the first exam because I did the readings. Then, everything got busy and then I sort of gave up haha. Join a study group, do OWLs, and never forget to do problem roulette. If you do well on one exam, you'll be fine if you bomb the last two. It's gen chem so it's going to be annoying.
Exams are pretty rough. Attendance counts, and your correctness on i-clicker questions matters. Sipowski is really helpful if you make an effort, but she can be a little harsh when you ask questions. Pay attention and it'll be okay.
Do the OWLs; they help a lot. Just do Problem Roulette before the tests, and you'll do decently. There's no curve. The tests are just 25 MC.  There are iClickers.   In my opinion, her accent makes it really hard to understand what she's saying. Also, her class was kind of boring, but what do you expect from an introductory chemistry class.
Really cares about her students. After the first exam, she e-mailed me and invited me to her office to talk about it and assured me things will get better and they did!

Teacher comments: 
Dr. B is extremely hard to follow during lecture, they're very confusing and many times he doesn't even introduce a topic. He'll just start talking about something random then moves on without explanation of what he is even talking about. I leave lecture lost almost everyday, and even rewatching them doesn't help.
If you want to be in a learning environment and also be welcomed, don't ever go to his office hours. I go to his 1-2x a week and I'm not sure if it's because I want to break through his meanness or whatever. I feel completely invalidated and idiotic after leaving his office. No matter his position, he should be formally evaluated or something.
If you're willing to work, Dr. B is willing to help. Don't expect to blow off biochem or not pay attention in lecture. Put in honest effort, and he will be there to assist at every step! Honestly a great prof - one of the best I've had at Michigan! Don't listen to those negative comments about him. Get to know him, attend office hours and work hard
Dr. B is truly awesome. Amazing lectures and VERY willing to helpful IF you are willing to put in the time. No-nonsense prof that can sometimes be humorous and sarcastic but in good taste. Strict but extremely caring if you demonstrate effort and investment in the class. Pay attention in lecture to follow his slides. Exams are hard but not undoable
Dr. B is conceited and very monotoned in lecture. He brushes off certain concepts that we've learned in other courses at the University and assumes you "learned it in grade school". He doesn't truly care about students' success and is a much harder grader than Dr. N. Overall, his lectures are of a lower quality and so is he.
Dr. B is super helpful if you go to office hours, but thats the thing. You almost always feel like you have to go because his lectures are really bad. He talks way too fast and his slides were confusing.
Dr. B is a decent teacher. He's passionate and knowledgeable about the material, but I think immunology in particular is a very complicated subject which can be challenging to teach regardless of proficiency level. I had difficulty learning in this class initially, but many other students did not, so you may have a better experience with Dr. B.
Thought he was a great biochem professor. Super clear about what you need to know, and it's obvious he's been doing this a long time. If you put in the work, it's most definitely possible to do well on his exams. Wish he was the only one that taught this class!
Dr. B is fantastic. He is very tough but clear on what he expects from his students. He actually makes biochemistry entertaining and tolerable. Extremely helpful if you take advantage of office hours and is always willing to help.
Dr. B is an exceptional biochem professor. He gets the point across, and explains the material extremely well. I would recommend re-watching all of the lectures because he talks very very fast sometimes. He can be pretty sassy, but it's honestly pretty funny. He's also super approachable in office hours.
He is a very engaging lecturer, and does a good job of presenting a large volume of material. However, he can also be a bit sassy in person, so I'd recommend approaching your GSI for one on one clarification. The exams are entirely based on lectures, so definitely re watch them before each midterm and rewrite your notes.
Dr. B is a wonderful professor who teaches biochemistry well and wants to ensure that all his students fully understand it and succeed. Is it a tough class? Absolutely, but only because of the volume of the material. Dr. B is really kind &amp; approachable. He will point out when you are wrong, but does so very respectfully. Study hard &amp; ask questions!
Dr. B is a great professor who teaches well and is always open to questions. It's clear that he truly wants the best for his students. That being said, the class itself is difficult, and there is a lot of material to memorize. However, the exams are all very fair and Dr. B is always accessible through piazza, email, or office hours.
Go to office hours, join a study group, and attend discussion and you'll be fine.  I personally loved this class and learned a lot from it.  Dr. B is very approachable in person and genuinely wants his students to succeed.  Memorize the slides word for word and don't bother reading the book if you're looking for an A.
In all honesty, Dr. B was the worst professor I've taken at the University. His general attitude makes students afraid to ask questions in lecture or attend office hours. The grading criteria was very unclear and the exams were near-impossible. He's incredibly smart and knowledgeable about biochemistry but honestly  it's not worth your GPA.
really hard and nit picky have fun! he has Attitude (capital A)!! he's very engaging and throws in some empathy towards his students haha he's very intimidating to ask questions to but he will do so if you do have any :) good luck!
Dr. B was a fine lecturer who clearly cares a lot about the material.  The lectures themselves are intrinsically too dense to absorb in one sitting, so I can't really blame him for the nature of studying biochem.  He could be kinda harsh - would say "meaning no disrespect" right before disrespecting you.  His energy is great though!
Dr. B may seem tough during lecture, but he is very helpful if you go to office hours. He really does care about students doing well and will help you with any questions you have on the lectures and on the cell map. Reading is completely not necessary so don't rent the book. His lectures provide everything you need to know for exams. Study weekly!
Kenneth was a poor instructor. Although biochem is known for being a difficult class he just made it more difficult than it had to be. Was very rude to students at lecture and office hours. Would not recommend taking biochem with him unless it is a MUST
Condescending. Makes students feel horrible for asking questions. Made me hate going to class. Would not recommend
Teacher name: Bielajew, Alex
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He gave the most useless lectures and the most insanely difficult assignments and tests which did little to further my understanding of the material. I felt like I was going through some sort of NERS hazing process. The grading was lenient though.
Knows what he's talking about. Loves to get off topic.
Really smart guy - studied theoretical physics or something like that at stanford. really wasn't made to be an engr 101 professor. get ringenberg. bielajew's lectures were nearly useless - he just plays around with his code. the GSIs were awesome, though.
The class was very informative and I learned a lot of information. The class handled students of many levels of prior knowledge. I had never coded before this class. The lectures are mostly examples and I learned a lot in Lab. Textbook is past lecture notes that are hard to understand if you have never coded before.
The Prof is a great teacher. He's very knowledgeable and can answer basically every question you throw at him, and he's very helpful during office hours. Not to mention his exams are arguably the most friendly. He was funny and informative during lecture, but most of the learning was done in lab, so definitely go to that.
As a freshman with no prior coding experience, Professor Bielajew made the transition into C++ and Matlab very easy. I learned more in laboratory section than I did in lecture, but Bielajew was enthusiastic about teaching coding and did his job extremely well. I feel prepared for advanced coding courses after his C++ preparation.
Professor Bielajew was great, really funny guy. His first couple lectures were very helpful, after that I mainly learned from labs. His class is admittedly much easier than the other 101 sections, but I came in with no programming experience and now I feel pretty confident in my abilities. I recommend him.
Class was overall pretty easy. I came in with no experience in programming and didn't struggle very much at all. Professor Bielajew just enjoys breaking his code instead of explaining it. Class was basically a waste, I learned everything from my GSI in lab.
If you have previous experience in programming the class is terrible. Way too easy as compared to other sections of 101. He also isn't very helpful when you ask questions.
Bielajew's lectures are a little bit incoherent, and he does not really explain what is behind his codes and programs. Yet he has some funny jokes, and can answer higher level questions. Projects take a lot of effort, but the GSI's are helpful and you learn a lot. Exams are extremely fair, and Bielajew makes sure you are prepared for the exams.
His lectures were near useless and he never actually taught in lecture. All he did was show us his codes etc etc. He also wasn't very helpful when I went to his office hours once and he made me feel like I wasn't welcome there because I was asking simple questions and wasting his time because he is "above me". You learn everything in lab with GSIs
Bielajew is an okay professor. His lectures are not very helpful to be honest, but the labs are. The online textbook is useless and not well laid out, I don't think I've read it once. The class overall is pretty easy. He taught C++ well but the MATLAB section of the course was awful. Very rushed, he seemed to assume that we knew more than we did.
Homework can be a bit rough at times but he is very fair and straight forward. You can tell he cares a lot about the undergraduate class. Had more than a few mind=blown moments in this class. If you put in the work you will do well.
Helpful and means well. His lectures aren't the best, you will have to study on your own A LOT. Don't rely on lectures alone to understand the material. Workload is reasonable, grading is reasonable. Do the quizzes if you want a good grade. Because if you don't do the quizzes your screwed. Makes a lot of corny jokes in class, which can be funny
Profesor Bielajew kept programming on an understandable level. Not going to lie you have to put in the work but believe me it is worth it in the end. He keeps things fun with the projects and the dude has a good sense of humor. Don't be afraid to go to office hours or talk to him!! He is extremely helpful
Super easy class.  Almost too easy in fact.  Even though I got an A, I left the class still feeling like a complete novice programmer.  I wouldn't have minded seeing some more advanced topics in the class.
Very solid professor.  His engr 101 is one of the easiest classes I've ever taken from elementary school to college inclusive.  My only real complaint is that he let's his GSIs grade you however they want, and my GSI chose to grade on participation.  Might as well grade me for penmanship while you're at it.
Does a decent job explaining everything. Occasionally goes off topic and sometimes shows code that beginners struggle to understand.  Book is very helpful and lectures are worth going to.  Can be hilarious at times which is a bonus
Taught C++ well. He made some successful jokes and lots of not so successful ones, but he definitely is great at programming. C++ was good, but Matlab was pretty rushed. He seems to go over a lot of excess material, but his programs are manageable and fair for beginners.
Great professor, treats the class like what it is meant to be - an INTRODUCTION to programming class. also gives interesting applications of the material.
Teacher name: Williams, Ralph
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
One of the most intelligent men I've ever met. The course was hard due to the pure amount of reading, but so worth it. Go to office hours to chat with him about anything, and also to see his incredible, overflowing library. My friends and I quote him on a regular basis now... "For the wind is very much up"
Ralph is a kind man and is of a rare breed of intellectual. One can learn a lot from him. However, it can be trying to engage in discussion with him. The papers are lots of work and seem to be unworthwhile. He expects a lot so it can be difficult when one isn't able to match that. Take P/F, such to maximize Ralph-time and minimize work-time.
Very entertaining and insightful. He strikes me as the sort of professor who would have been brilliant when he was in his prime. He can now be unfocused and sometimes repetitive, but he's still great.
Amazing professor! Life lessons learned. Took him every semester I could!
Ralph claims to welcome all to the table for discourse, but ultimately he doesn't care about what you think unless you're agreeing with him. He welcomes varying interpretations, but if they disagree with his, he disregards them. He seems like a nice guy, but don't take this class unless you're willing to change your viewpoints to agree with him.
Completely disorganized.
I haven't met a more engaging man, I sat in on three of his lectures with a friend and I couldn't agree more with people. He is really smart, kind-harted, and a gentleman. He engages everyone with the respect you deserve and is willing to talk to any one, if I could I would take all of his classes
Everything just seemed a bit vague. No due dates for the readings and no tests until the final. Two papers on whatever you please (as long as it's relevance can be argued). Lectures are rambling and theatrical. Perhaps the topic just wasn't of interest to me, or maybe I need more structure than what was given, but this class wasn't my favorite.
I've taken 3 classes wProf. Williams.  At first I was a huge fan of his.  But I started to realize he uses the same anecdotes and same wandering manner in lectures.  Very scattered, doesn't explain concepts in clear manner and asks "Yay or nay" in a way that discourages dissent. I feel like he's trying to impart life lessons, not analyze the texts
Williams is much more preoccupied with impressing his students through his performances in class rather than teaching you anything, even though he claims the opposite. He's very set in his ways; even though books should be up to the interpretation of the reader, it's his way or you're wronggraded down. I felt like my time and money was wasted.
I took Williams because I had heard great things, and I've never been more disappointed. Rather than teach, he really just gives book reports, yet he expects his students to analyze for their essays. However, on the final, he expects you to repeat what he said in class, which I don't view as helpful to me in any way. So, you have to go to class.
Ralph is a very knowledgable professor and has historical context deeply ingrained into his lectures. Unfortunately, he tends to ramble on in his lectures, leaving an abundance of muddled information. Regardless, his lectures are very eye-opening and interesting.
Talk about a guy who shapes your college career--who shapes you for life. Ralph is it. One of the most genuine, enthusiastic, kind-hearted and dedicated professors at UM. I brought a friend from another top-ranked school to sit in on one of his lectures--my friend was floored. He picks great books and speaks about them with unparalleled passion.
It would be a sin go to U of M and not take his class. His lack of schedule and frustrations with that will be made up by wit, charm, and inspiration. He is the smartest guy I ever met- and extremely humble. I still have pages of my notebook from tid-bits I found inspiring in his class. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Sorry for being extreme lol
Professor Williams is great! I took "Memoirs and Social Crisis" with him and his insights have truly changed the way I think about the world. Great guy, there for students, and really passionate about what he teaches. Grading expectations were somewhat high, but he's the kind of professor you want to do good for. Lots of EC available too!
This was my second class with Prof Williams and all I can say is I wish I could take a 3rd. He is an incredibly engaging speaker and steers discussion in incredibly interesting ways. I didn't only learn a lot about course material, but also about how to think. Even if you are not an english major, take a class with Ralph! You won't regret it!
I agree with everyone that he is a brilliant guy, knows his stuff, enthusiastic, and kind. HOWEVER, respectfully, he does have his blind spots. He'll treat material he disagrees with in a belittling manner and if you raise objections in class he just shuts you down. He's willing to engage in discussion, unless you end up disagreeing with him.
He's literally the best prof you'll ever have. He greets every single student in lecture every single day; he loves us that much and continually tells us how great it is to share time with us. I LOVE this class. We read memoirs about social crisis (slavery, holocaust, vietnam war, AIDS) and I honestly read all of them 'cause they were all great.
Ralph Williams is one of my favorite teacher on campus.  Both the breadth and depth of his knowledge is astounding. He's clear and enthusiastic and compassionate; I highly recommend taking any class with him. I read all of Paradise Lost for this guy.  He is gold.
Phenomenal!! Ralph Williams is so smart, so compassionate, and cares so much about his students. I've never met someone quite like him. I loved this class, and I was so sad when it was over. I had him as my discussion leader as well as for lecture, and that made the class even better. Our final exam was a discussion about Shakespeare at his house!

Teacher comments: 
She's so salty and always throws temper tantrums in office hours.
Not a great professor, but in EECS183 you can attend any lecturer you want, so don't worry if you get stuck with her. All lectures are recorded as well. She is very considerate in office hours, but is not a great lecturer...
Not too difficult of a class but she was both a bad teacher and a bad person. Least favorite professor I have had at UofM.
She's one of those people who thinks she's strong and bold, but is in reality just rude and very bitter.
My group for the final project went to meet with her because even the IAs couldn't find the problem with our code. She was condescending and ended up yelling at us and blaming us for not understanding concepts. Interestingly enough, the concept was something we had never even learned before... I would go to another professor if you have questions.
Terrible teacher. Always very rude and unhelpful.
Let's just say that Nic Cage speaks at a more consistent volume.  Lectures can get pretty boring.  One time one of the other EECS 183 lecturers subbed for us and that was pretty good.  I'd say go for another lecturer if you can but it won't impact your grade at all.  Super easy class
Definitely pay attention to the reading. That's how I learned all the material for the class. Her lecture is very boring and discussion is basically useless. Find friends to work on the projects with and don't get too hung up on exam grades. Start projects and assignments early of you WILL regret it. Overall, fun class!!
EECS 183 is easily the most frustrating class I've ever taken.  The lecture slides, as well as the online supplement material, covers a bare minimum of how implement code correctly.  The office hours are an absolute mess; if you don't have hours to dedicate to getting one question answered, don't waste your time going.  Don't take this class.
I went to her OH and started to doubt myself. She was so rude and didn't provide any helpful advice at all.
Went to her OH twice. First time, I had no idea what to do for a project and she was very rude about explaining anything. It was like she couldn't possibly understand why I was confused about anything on that project. Second time, I had a large part of another project done (thanks to the GSIs), and she was much nicer and helpful with my questions.
She can come off as rude, snobbish, or unhelpful , but ultimately she really wants to help students learn and be successful in one of the most challenging fields offered at Michigan. Work hard, stay on top of the material, form a study group, make a good team on the final project and you'll have a great experience.  I really liked her and the class
Her manner of speaking is extremely annoying, and she is quite rude and unhelpful in general. The class is pretty easy though, and thankfully, the rest of the staff is fantastic.
She's so. rude.
Dorf is the LEAST helpful professor I have ever had.  Her answers to students' questions are vague and often condescending.  She over complicated simple concepts and wastes class time on unrelated topics. The projects are boring and extremely exact.  Nearly impossible to complete without going to OH.  Very happy this class is over.
Dorf is extremely unsupportive and unpleasant to be around. She  makes a big deal about how "coding is for everyone" blah blah but if you have questions, she often makes you feel inferior. Her emails and comments on Piazza are very rude. Its time for her to retire honestly. Don't go to Dorf for help with this class, the IA's are your best bet.
Dorf isn't the best lecturer but you don't have to worry about her tbh. The IAs and Office Hours are the lifeblood of this class. Go to office hours and start early! Can't stress this enough! You will do well if you do that. Overall, really great class. It's set up extremely well and the projects are fun! I recommend it to everyone!
She's super annoying and is rude. If you ask for help and you don't know the answer she will be angry and is a very unpleasant person to be around.
One of the best teachers I've ever had - and definitely the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable programming instructor I've ever met. Really supportive/proud of her students. Make sure to not miss any lectures if you don't have to; do all of the CodeLab exercises/practice tests, and you'll be sure to do well in the class!
A very unpleasant and unhelpful person. Treats all students as if they don't know the meaning of hard work.
Teacher name: Ringenberg, Jeffrey
School name: University of Michigan
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I had Ringenberg for 280, and I thought his lectures were entertaining and really helpful. He explained complicated concepts really well, and would take time with each question to answer it thoroughly. The projects and exams for the class can be tricky, but if you give yourself enough time and stay caught up, they're definitely manageable.
He was an okay lecturer for ENGR 151. I had previous programming experience, but I found the material quite difficult because he zoomed through most concepts and did not explain the harder things like recursion very clearly.
Yay! I'm being specific!! :)
Super funny and enthusiastic. This was his first time teaching ENGR151. We start with the basics of programming in the beginning of the semester so it was boring at first for people with prior coding experience. I would highly recommend having prior coding experience though cuz we went fast afterwards. Mandatory labs, lectures recorded online.
Very entertaining lecturer.
Take his class, best ENGN 101 teacher here by far
I like Ringenberg, went to almost all his lectures. He has early office hours up north, but I went once and I found him very helpful. It's an easy A if you keep up with the lectures and projects. I recommend going to class even if the lectures are recorded.
Going in, I hardly knew anything about programming. He knew there were lots of kids in that boat, and I think he did a good job of teaching from the ground up in that respect.  So even if you don't have any experience, it's not too hard to get a good grade if you keep up with the material.
Good teacher and lecturer.  Dry sense of humor.  Tests are quite tricky, but that's just the class. Lots of work.  Based on my performance compared to others who performed at a lower level than I did,  I don't agree with the grade I got.
Dr. Ringenberg is a great professor, however the class was quite unorganized this semester. Not sure how much of that was his fault or not. Otherwise, his lectures were interesting for the most part.
Jeff was a good professor overall. Since they were early lectures on north, I almost never went to class except for lab. As long as you read the powerpoint notes online you should be fine if you have some experience with programming. From what I heard of the other professors, Jeff is the best one to have for Engr101.
Amazing Professor. Attendance is not required because he posts recordings of his lectures. His PowerPoints are very easy to follow and have walkthroughs of code which make it easy to understand. Although lecture was early on north, he made it as painless as possible
Awesome professor. If you're in compsci and have the chance to have him, you have to be in his class. He's the rock star professor that every college needs.  If you go to lectures and pay attention, take time to understand the material, it's an easy A. (but you still have to put in some work)
Yes indeed. Accept and love this man.
I had Ringenberg for both 101 and 280. Not the easiest person to pay attention to but he explains things alright. Can be a bit of a superiority complex. 101 is for weeding people out of CoE, and 280 is where they start weeding out CS wannabes. I did well in 101, but so did everybody in 280, so 280 is much harder. Many CS wannabes give up after 280.
Ringenberg can be funny in lecture. He does shoot for a certain grade average though and admits that. Class is meant to weed people out of the College of Engineering as a whole rather than just a major within it (seriously if you can't do at least decently in the class you don't have the ability to succeed in engineering). Exams are tough but fair.
I thought Ringenberg was good for 101, but only okay for 280. Can be a nice guy, although occasionally condescending. Something with the way he teaches just didn't resonate with me. I always zoned out and went off task if I went to lecture. Lecture is not mandatory. Just watch the lecture recordings at 1.5x. It saves time.
Not a real expert in the course material because he was wrong with inheritance (whether private member variables are inherited). But this doesn't matter because exams are made by GSIs and he is even not responsible for the autograder and projects. That being said, you should either learn by yourself or go to DeOrio for deeper understanding of C++.
EECS 280 is a tough class. Ringenberg is an okay professor. A bit of a superiority complex, but is good enough to make you understand the concepts. The exams are extremely hard and you cannot count on your projects to save your grade. Don't expect any sympathy if you try to submit your project to the autograder even one second late though.
For EECS 280 Ringenberg contributes to how tough the exams can be. This class IS meant to weed out CS majors, despite the instructors denying it. Many people think after ENGR 101 that they wanna do CS and then say "never mind" after EECS 280. He can be funny at times, but somehow I always got bored and couldn't pay attention in his lectures.

Teacher comments: 
Tait does a great job. This the second course I took from her because I like her.
Awsome !
Dr. Tait is the most caring professor i've ever had. She gives you every chance to have an 100% in her class. She take she time in lecture and really wants to make sure everyone understands. Her assignments may seem confusing but she leaves room for individuality. She answers questions well. She bought our whole class subway.
Tait is concerned about the students. She helps you succeed
Tait is a super nice lady, she's very kind hearted and sweet to her students. Although, she doesn't do a good job (whatsoever) of explaining assignments to students. This class has no Tests, quizzes, exams, projects, or even a textbook required. Just one paper every two weeks. The class is easy, but she makes it very difficult.
Alice is a nice and respectful prof
Great Prof. !!!
Dr. Tait is a nice professor. She is easy to understand but spends the entire class period talking about her personal experiences rather than lecture based material. I could not tell you one thing I actually learned in this class. She requires participation points but only every other class period. Really easy but the class was a waste of time.
Dr. Tait is a really intact professional.
I would tell my friends to take this class and this prof. You learn a lot. go to class and you will do well. she really cares about her students.
In this class I learned a lot about media and how it impacts alana and lgbqt.
I learned a lot from this class and this prof. My roommate took the class and told me to take it. I am glad that I did.
Dr. Tait is the best professor i have had while attending CMU. She cares about each individual student and their grade. she talks to me every time I see her, even outside of class. she has real emotion and passion for her work and she is a great educator. the rest of the reviews giving her a 2.2 are stupid.
This class was required for my major. I thoroughly enjoy studying race relations and gender issues. I was so excited for this course that I reached out to her before the class began to do extra work for her. She treated me disrespectfully to the point I left her office crying more than once. She is disorganized and doesn't relate to students.
She drags out the class as long as possible without gaining any information about the subject. The subject of racism and culture in the media has a chance to be interesting, but she completely ruins it by not teaching you anything. Quizzes are online and open note making it an easy A. Overall just don't take this class unless you really have to.
easy class and the class is organized. sometimes she gets off schedule and that hellps us. i liked the speakers. i liked hearing and seeing the other students' presentations. i learned a lot from this course and prof.
One of the easier courses I have taken but easily the most unorganized professor I ever had, which is actually worse than having a hard class that IS organized. Also, gets defensive if you disagree with anything, which is odd for a course that is very much opinion based. I had a 93.5 in her course she refused to round up. Kept me off Dean's list.
Easy Class and I learned a lot for my classmates' projects and guest speakers. Come to class an you should do okay-she has organized the class well.
Not the biggest fan- unorganized, doesn't put grades in correctly, repeats lectures a lot. She does offer 10 extra credit points max, which is nice, but still needs to work on putting them in Blackboard correctly. 2 participation points/class, so come, but just do stuff on your laptop during class and you'll be fine.
Her class is easy, but she is very unorganized.
Teacher name: Stewart, Thomas
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Basically just lectured and watched movies the entire semester. Nothing he talks about has much relavence. He gives you the exam questions ahead of time so you just have to prepare those. Really boring and not very enjoyable. Im sure hes a nice person outside of class.
Very passionate about politics &amp; teaching. Encourages discussion a lot, as long as you go to class you will be fine. Watch a lot of movies, but they are informative!! He gives the test questions ahead of time so you can prepare and it's easy to get good grades on the tests and he offers extra credit. I would take him again.
Can sometimes ramble on about random things that dont matter and you watch a good amount of movies/ videos. Only 3 exams and a term paper. Tells you what is going to be on exams so they arent too bad.
This professor is a firecracker! One must pay attention and take good notes to keep up, but his lectures are definitely interesting. He encourages discussion, covers a lot of important material, and he finds a way to relate the material to current events. He gets fired up. 10/10 recommend.
As long as you show up to class and write down what he says you'll be fine. He gives you the exam questions ahead of time and allows you to ask questions during review. Overall he's a great professor with a deep passion for politics
DO NOT TAKE. Worst experience I've ever had when it comes to professors at CMU. The first day of class, I had read the reviews online here but went in with an open mind. Horrible decision. He ridiculed me in front of the entire class because I said "God bless." He continued to bring up how stupid I was for being religious. Horrible lectures as well
He had zero outlines and would always write random unrelated words on the board with arrows. No study guides, and no way to tell if a lecture is important or not. Very little organization or blackboard materials. Quite old fashioned.
Syllabus said if you have over 5 absences, points will be taken off. Well, I skipped class about 10 times &amp; my grade wasnt affected at all. His lectures are long, boring, and pretty pointless. He gave the essay qs before the exam. I opened the book once and ended with an A. Take this class for an easy A, even though going to class will be a drag.
Don't take this guy. Does nothing but lecture for the whole class period and has no note structure whatsoever. Super tough when grading the essay questions on the exams. Always says the questions come from the readings in the books, they don't. Save yourself the trouble and find another professor for this class because this guy is really bad.
Class is strictly lectures. He gets very carried away in lectures and it is hard to decipher what is important and what is not. His tests are extremely difficult and he grades the four essays very hard. He says to use the readings from the book but they have no correlation to the tests other than a few random facts that seem unrelated to the course
He's very lecture heavy, doesn't give outlines. He has an unusual sense of humor and can sometimes be taken as being mean. Go to his office hours, he is always willing to work with you outside of class! Great guy one on one but in class, he can come off as a bit rude.
Well I ended up dropping this class. He took over a month to grade our first exam, the first exam had nothing from lecture or the book (which you will be spending a lot of time with), and lectures are awful. Will single you out and make you feel stupid. My academic advisor recommended I take this at comm. college and I hope everyone does the same
All of his exams are in essay format, and you have to write 3 essays per exam, in class. If you are not a fast or good writer would not recommend. Does give a list of prompts about a week before and you choose your three topics. Loves to go on tangents and give his opinion. A big research paper is given on topic of your choice. Would take again.
I would not recommend taking this class with  Stewart. He does not provide any power points or any structure of notes at all. He just lectures every single day for the whole class period. The only things that were graded in this class were your exams and a five page paper you had to write. You have to read the book and teach yourself everything.
He is friendly and will get to know you if you meet with him. Help is there if you ask for it. He's not going to hold your hand and walk you through the textbook, it's up to you to spend the time and read it. The lecture can get off topic but its because he wants us to discuss what's going on in the world and how it relates to the class.
The classes aren't that bad, he doesn't write down notes or have an outline so it's up to you to listen and take notes. The exams are not too hard as long as you pay attention and read the chapters. He has an exam review and gives you the questions for the essay in advance. If you put in the work you will be fine.
He was ok, went on tangents but expected stuff to be on exams. Does give you essay questions early to study and has review day class before exam, ask questions. Watches lots of movies.. takes attendance every class
I'm usually not too picky but he is awful. He belittles students and I felt like I had to hide in the back so he would not see me. He is very arrogant and has a specific opinion on politics that he shoves down your throat (even though it should be mutual because it's a political science class). If theres another option for a teacher, go with them.
Lectures have nothing to do with the course at all. You will see something for the first time on the exam. He takes attendance, and he has strong opinions, and if you don't agree with him he will argue back with you like a 5 year old. If you have a question he makes you feel dumb about it and wont give you a clear answer. Tons of EC, and a paper.
DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR! This was by far the worst professor I have ever had in my life. He is extremely unclear on what will be on the exams; his lectures often go off topic and are very confusing. You are graded on three tests, a group discussion project and a term paper.

Teacher comments: 
This was a great professor, make sure you keep up with your online homework and you are set. Read through the study guide and you will pass! He is such a nice name and is willing to help if you're willing to put in a little bit of effort.
This was one of the easiest classes I took at CMU. I only showed up to class on the exam days, which was only like 4 days of the whole semester! The book for the class is online, and there are also online discussions and quizzes that were due weekly. The study guide is just a little over 200 questions, and he chooses around 50 of them right from it
Dr. Carroll is not the professor to take for an online class. For a psychological testing class, his tests had the most obscure and specific questions. He expected us to know each reliability and validity coefficient for the exam, and there were hundreds! If you do take this class online, his test answers and questions are available on quizlet.
You don't need to show up at all. His lectures are pointless, plus his powerpoints are online. As long as you do the homework assignments online, you'll pass. Also, his tests are taken straight from the review we get so as long as you get the correct answers from the study session, you'll be good to go. Very nice professor though!
Only went to class on exam days, partly because he puts all the answers to the exams in the study guide he gives you, partly because he was sometimes rude to students in class.
Easiest class I ever taken at CMU. Make sure you do the online quizzes and discussion boards. Don't bother going to class, just do the study guide before the Exam and you will do fine.
Easiest class I have EVER taken. Never went to class expect for exam days. Study guide has exact answers of exams. It is 200 questions, he takes 50 of those questions from the study guide and that is the exam. Exactly the same question, word order, and answer set up. Make flash cards and study those. Weekly quizzes that you get unlimited attempts.
Dr. Carroll was literally the easiest professor I have had in college. I only went to class on exam days. You have weekly TED talk discussion boards and weekly quizzes but the quizzes you get 4 tries to get the right answer. His exams are 50 questions, multiple choice and he takes them word by word from a 200 question study guide. Super easy!!!!
Good Professor, but I do not like his teaching style becuase there is not need to go to class as he give you a 200 question study guide and only 50 will be on the exam so basically he is grade how well your memory is right? Can loook up the answers on google, some you can't but most are online. If you need this for a UP this will be a easy A.
Make sure to keep checking your grade! I had to retake his class because he gave me a D when I scored all a's and b's on his exams. It said in blackboard I had a b+ and he put a D on my transcript. Other than that he gives a LONG (200 question study guide) with the exam questions inside. Ted talks and quizzes each week. Pointless lectures in class.
Easy A regardless of if you're taking 100 or 220. Don't buy the Ted Talk website, wait until others post the title on the discussion board shell and look it up on youtube. The online quizzes are credit/no credit and the exams are 50 of the 200 questions on the study guide. I did need to use the 220 book for the study guide.
Loved him. Fill out the study guides for the exams and study them like crazy and you'll do well. Definitely recommend him over the other psychology professors -- from what I've heard on campus, he's the best and he teaches the material really well.
Very easy class. Majority don't show up for class and do well. I went every day and got an A.  Weekly quizzes online that are credit/no credit, ted talk videos, 4 exams, and an optional final. Exams are easy. A study guide is given to you with 200 multiple choice questions, 50 of those are the exam questions. Do the study guide and you'll do fine.
He is so dull. His voice will put you to sleep. The whole class period is him just talking in front of the screen meanwhile the notes are on blackboard. He gives exam reviews that are 200 questions long but no answer guide so you have no idea if you're studying the right thing or not. Good Luck.
You'll have weekly quizzes &amp; TED Talks you have to do. Easy points. He gives you a study guide which has the same questions that are on the exam. He is pretty lecture heavy but passionate about teaching. He gets mad if people don't show up to class which makes it worse of those of us who do show up because we have to hear about it so just show up.
Dr. Carroll is such a great guy and he's very passionate about his subject. However, much of his class was based around watching videos and we didn't usually talk about material from the text. Attendance wasn't mandatory and the only homework was a weekly quiz online and watching a TedTalk. Overall, it was an easy class.
Honestly all the previous reviews summed up this class pretty well. I had a loose-leaf copy of the textbook and it helped when I was doing the study guides since the online version is difficult to navigate. I did the weekly Ted Talks in advance when I had higher priority things to do. Easy but somewhat interesting material.
Dr. Carroll states it's your education, so it's your decision to show up for it. I did attend class every week though I didn't have to. I found his material relevant and the lectures provided additional outside understanding that showed what the book was saying. You can pass without attending, but he brings more to the lecture than the book.
Do the review guides and you'll do fine on the exams. Weekly lecture is not mandatory, (I did attend every single one though and it helped )the  only days that are mandatory are exam days. Carrol is a funny and sincere professor. There is weekly homework but, it's very easy.
I missed 2 TedTalks and 1 quiz because he assigns them every week. The weeks just kind of jumble up together and you forget to do them (trust me) it happens to a lot of the class. DO SONA STUDIES FOR EXTRA CREDIT. I got 60 points that way. It's almost always just sitting at a computer for a half hour, providing data for a psych student.
Teacher name: Jurkiewicz, Kenneth
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Kenneth is not a bad prof. He knows his stuff, although his lectures are very long and boring. He tells you exactly what he is looking for when grading your papers. The one report you write, you literally follow it from the textbook.
In BCA 101, you watch a movie and then get lectured the next day. The class is not too terribly hard, but the exams are very specific so if you dont pay attention or attend class, you will have a hard time. Overall, it is a pretty easy class. He does assign quizzes too, but you do not know when they will be.
The exams are tough and very specific but always ONLY what's in the lecture. Quizzes after almost every film. One big paper but if you follow format you'll be fine.
Either he gives a long lecture or you watch a movie. The 3 exams are very specific so be taking good notes in class. Sometimes its hard to figure out what things he says are important/exam material because he talks so much. I really like his thoughts though and Im planning on taking another course by him later.
I loved Dr. Jurkiewicz although his lectures can be long and boring he is a funny goofy guy and is very knowledgeable on film he is very smart. The tests are hard just like most BCA classes, but if you study and listen and take notes you'll do just fine.
Jurkiewicz is a really hard prof. His lectures are long and boring but he covers material that will be on the test. Tests are 100 questions with "matching", t/f, and a variety of hard questions. Most will have a-e on scantron. I say "matching" because you can use multiple answers twice... Be prepared and know dates, names, themes, and movie info
Really funny and passionate professor! Good lectures that will almost always take up the whole class. The exams are a little tough but as long as you do great on the big paper you will definitely pass the class with flying colors! I will be taking him again for a horror films class next semester.
Dr. J is a solid choice for a prof. There is one paper and it's so easy! You have to buy a special book from the bookstore and it has an example of the paper in the coursepack. Exams are a little difficult so make sure you go to every class because that's the only way you'll know what the exam will be over. There are movie quizzes but very easy.
very hard class. I am a 4.0 student and struggled to get an A.
He's very enthusiastic about the history of films and the films themselves.  Not afraid to say his honest opinions and cracks jokes. A funny guy. Some of the movies in the beginning are a bit boring but it gets better. Read the chapters but the test is heavily what's discussed in the lecture. Very fun class!
Dr. J is a really good professor. He is hilarious and also very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject. His classes are compromised of one large paper (if you follow the format you'll get an A), three tests which are very difficult, and watching movies and listening to lectures the next class period. He doesn't take attendance.
Like Danny DeVito had a love child with Bernie Sanders and got the best traits of both. I am infinitely glad I took this man's class. So many lectures but the dude is hilarious and fantastic to listen to.
Don't take this class if you don't like movies, first of all. This class is also heavily orientated in HISTORY-- so you need good memorization skills for specific facts. You watch a lot of movies in-class and talk about them. His lectures take up the entire class period and there are NO visuals. Need good listening/note-taking skills.
He's great!  Yea, on lecture days it's exactly 1 hr and 50 mins, but he makes it interesting and funny.  He's SOOO passionate about movies; it's contagious!  I've been looking for more of his classes to take and I'm an Environmental Safety Major!  I didn't read the book, at all except for the sample report (which I HIGHLY recommend; I got a 100).
I loved this Sherlock Holmes class. I thought the movie and television selected was good. I liked the way they were grouped, too. The paper was actually really fun to write! Just know that 525 is a 4 hour class, and Dr. J will use that whole time each week! NO POWERPOINTS.
Lectures are extremely long and boring, he gives no visuals at all. If you're a visual learner, this class is not for you. I wouldn't suggest this professor to anyone. He isn't good at teaching the material and drags on and on about subjects. He also is very bad at emailing back and communicating with students!
Love Dr. J! His class is harder than the other prof that teaches 101 from what I hear, but really respect his knowledge and passion for the subject. You can learn a lot from him!! Easy A as long as you do the readings and attend every class. Hardly ever homework.
Don't take this class. Seriously. I have to retake BCA101 with a new professor because I didn't receive a high grade. His lectures take up the entire two hours and are very dull. The movies are okay, but he is too detail-oriented with his quizzes and he grades extremely hard on them. His exams are 100 very-specific questions.
He's truly passionate about movies. I took this as a genre study on Sherlock Holmes and so there obviously isn't much to go on, but he still managed to find something to tell us about for 2+ hours without making us fall asleep. Textbooks are somewhat needed for the exam, but he mostly bases his test questions off of movie quotes- somewhat difficult
Knows ALOT about the subject and knows what he is talking about, if this is your major I would recommend talking to him about his knowledge. His lectures are SOOO long and painful although and they get dragged on for the entire 2 hours, don't ever expect to get out early. Good teacher just a boring class &amp; his tests are pretty difficult.
Teacher name: Lindahl, Susan
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
You can miss class, but don't skip all the time. It's pretty straight forward as long as you go and do the reading. You have to attend concerts as well, like choir concerts.
Mrs. Lindahl is definitely one of my favorite instructors i've had so far. I took her class for a WI. Not very challenging, but broadens the mind. If you need a WI you should take her class.
Very nice professor that offers LOTS of extra credit, even free points on tests (ie. "just mark A"). If you're struggling, which shouldn't happen much, she is very accessible for office hours and gets back to you frequently on emails. Topics are also interesting and easy to learn also it's just music and learning to appreciate it. Fantastic class
Super easy class for nonmusic majors. Definitely have to put effort into studying for exams if you want a good grade but there are a lot of easy points in the class to boost your grade if you don't do well on the exams. Tons of extra credit points (I went into the final exam with over 100% in the class). Online HW due before class is easy.
Susan is a great professor and offers a ton of extra credit. It is extremely hard to not get above an A- in this class. No attendance is taken, however, there are 12 quizzes throughout the semester. Most of the time you can use your notes, she provides you the answer, or gives you points for trying. This is a very easy class for a UP.
Professor Lindahl is easily one of CMU's best. Plenty of extra credit opportunities, and attendance is not taken, although there are weekly "quizzes" that you can use notes on. You have to attend 2 concerts outside of class and write a review about them but it isn't as bad as it sounds. This is a very easy class, and Susan only helps to prove it
She was awesome! Doesn't take attendance, but does in class responses randomly. Easy A if you have the notes. Exams you can use a notecard, so it isn't too bad. Plenty of opportunities for extra credit! Would definitely take her again.
Pay attention in class or get notes from a friend and you'll do fine. There are in class quizzes at the end, but you can use notes. 3 tests, 2 concerts and 1 project all easy to get A's on. She is helpful if you email her or talk to her after class. Boring class, but super easy A.
Lindahl was a great professor to have for this class. You are required to go to 2 concerts for the class throughout the semester, but less than other mus114 professors. If you keep up on the online quizzes (you can always get 100%) and do the extra credit youll be totally fine. She really wanted her students to succeed and is very helpful!
She isn't the most sympathetic professor, but it is so easy to pass the class. She offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get 100% on them. Show up to class though because there are little in-class responses that add up to 150 points throughout the semester. You have to attend 2 concerts and write about them. Overall OK.
Organized professor, very nice lady, and very understanding. Easy A if you attend class and put forth the effort. Learned a lot I have never known before. Would recommend if you were to take the class.
Great class.  All you have to do is show up and pay attention (make sure you get the right notecards). I went to a performing arts school in middle school so I already knew most of the things but she does explain things really well and she is willing to help if you dont. The class was with about 200 other kids so go to her office hours, if need be.
Dr. Lindahl is great! I am not majoring in anything music-related, but took this class because I heard it was an easier WI. She doesn't even give that many writing assignments, and the ones that she does assign are easy. The homework is really simple and the exams aren't too bad either. Go to class because she does in-class assignments sometimes.
As I'm sure for many who are reading this I am not in the music program nor am I an expert even after this course. But it was a really easy to pass course, professor Lindahl offers a ton of extra credit and you can't not get a 100% on the online homework and quizzes. If you need a music class for graduation this is the way to go.
Prof. Lindahl was great. She knew that almost the entire class was taking it because it was an easy UP. Easy homework- online music guides that had to be completed in a week. No reason why you can't get an A. All the answers were in the book, so the assignments were very easy. She's a great prof. if you don't understand music, as she makes it fun!
Although I don't understand music nor have I ever taken a music class, she made things very simple. The only way you wouldn't pass this class is if you didn't do any of  the work. If you put in the effort, regardless of your test grades, you WILL pass with an A
Professor Lindahl is a great professor, who does a good job at explaining the idea of music to non music majors. She gives you guided notes, and if you pay attention you will do good on the exam. She offers lots of extra credit, and gives you ample time to complete assignments.
Professor Lindahl was an awesome professor. She is very passionate about music, and it makes it easy to put in the effort. If she can tell you are trying you will get a good grade. Attendance is highly recommended.
Susan was a great professor. She gave many extra credit opportunities, and allowed everyone to pass with at least an A if effort was put in. Showing up to class is not mandatory, but is very helpful in order to receive a high grade. She is very passionate about music, but is also respectful to those that aren't.
I really liked her! She was very respectful to students and understood that not everyone would learn at the same pace. Very organized!!!! Loved the online quizzes that you could take until you reached 100%. Lots of Extra Credit opportunities. She really cared about music and teaching music to students who probably have never studied it yet.
Teacher name: Jaffa, Melvyn
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
if you've never taken psych before do not take his class!! jumps around in his lectures a lot and doesn't make sense.  his tests are worded weird but he offers up to 30 points in extra credit
Very lecture heavy. Covers so much material for each exam, which there are 50 question exams every other week. His voice is monotone and boring, and it is easy to zone out during class or not go in general. Only positive about him is that he covers the material thoroughly if you are actually interested in psych. Exams can be confusing and hard
Decent lectures but not engaging at all. VERY clear criteria in syllabus. Extra credit opportunity for 18 points plus pop quiz for extra credit if high amount of absences on any given day. Gives good notes and semi-difficult exams. 7 exams by the way, every other week.
This class is SO lecture heavy and he's very boring and monotone. He knows what he's talking about but if you have trouble paying attention you won't do well. All of your grade relies on 4 exams worth 50pts each and are biweekly. Exams can be difficult and confusing. One of the worst profs I've ever had.
Definitely a lecture heavy class. It is pretty much you sitting there for the whole hour while he talks. Every test was pretty much straight from the book and notes. If you take solid notes and keep up with the reading it should be a pass. ONE POSITIVE if you keep a B or higher by the end you get a chance to do research which does look great on app
Seriously the worst professor I have ever had. He doesn't care about his students and the class is only out of 200 points (4 exams) and the exams are ridiculous and have nothing to do with lecture or the book. He says everyone fails his class and doesn't do anything to change it. Take this class online.
Jaffa knows his material but he is very monotone and speeds through his lectures if he is running out of time. His exams are difficult and can be confusing. His lectures can be very hard to follow and I would not recommend this professor if you have a hard time paying attention in class. You need to read the book or you will fail.
He is very intelligent and has taught for a long time. I can see how many see his way of teaching as difficult to follow, however, I really liked it. If you're a more intelligent student and you truly care about learning for learning's sake, you'll like him. He is a bit older, but he truly loves the material and will give you a lot of knowledge.
Granted, I am only a sophomore, but this was the absolute worst class I have ever taken in my life.  I was taking 18 credits when I took this class.  Got an A in all of them except this one.  Failed this one.  He doesn't know how to lecture and doesn't know how to help you.  I would recommend taking this online!!!!!!!!!!!
I think Jaffa is just getting too old to teach now a days. He seems like a good guy and it's hard to be harsh on him but he's just someone you don't want to take a class with everything you basically have to teach yourself.
He is an extremely boring monotone professor that repeats words he just said multiple times every sentence. He tells you that many people fail his class but doesn't do anything to change that. He's not there to help you and every exam he gives has material that wasn't in the book or covered by him in class. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  not with Jaffa.
Ive had to take this class more than once because it is so hard. The lectures are actually some what interesting but he makes them boring. There are only 4 grades for the class and they are all exam grades. He will tell you on the first day of class that most people fail and it is a very hard class. He is a very nice person, just a hard professor.
Very boring and monotone. Got mad easily and didn't care if he kept you after the class is supposed to be over
unable to understand him and learn the material. very erratic and awkward. not very helpful in explanations. half the class failed the class and he is the only one that teaches it. unless you take it online with a different professor, dont take it with him.
Jaffa is not the nicest or easiest professor you'll ever have, but you do end up learning a lot if you pay attention. The tests are hard, but if you read the book, review the homework, and read his handouts, you won't get less than a B.  Getting a A is hard, not impossible. Overall:  smart guy, kind of a jerk, but you'll learn a lot.
Mel is seriously the worst prof I've ever had. I would like to think he's a nice person, but DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. EVER. He told us multiple times that people do poorly in his class, yet he does nothing to change it. The highest grade in the class is like a C. I took 2 years in high school and have struggled all semester.
I had to take this class twice because it was required. The material in the class is actually interesting but the way he teaches and what he focuses on makes it unclear and less interesting. there are no assignments in the class and only 4 tests out of 50 which are basically impossible.
Initially on the first day of class he flat out said that half of us would end up dropping, and shows no sign of caring about how well his students do. As a psychology major I am genuinely interested in the material and attended all lectures.  My grade of a C+ was one of the highest in the class when I am usually an A student.  Tests are confusing.
Taking PSY 330 with Jaffa was definitely a great idea.  Always go to class because he gives out notes that you can add more too, which is EXTREMELY helpful! He also explicitly tells you when certain things should be copied down which is a good majority of the time. Lots of studies we reviewed were from previous classes, but still helpful.
Needs to retire. Worst teacher I have or will ever have in my lifetime. I'm a psychology major and absolutely love psychology. I get A's in every psych class I've taken and this class was pathetic. Take it with someone else if you don't want to waste your money like myself, and half of the class did after we all dropped it. Can't even ask for help.

Teacher comments: 
Worst professor I've had at CMU. He makes the lectures super super boring and have no correlation whatsoever. He is very knowledgable about his field but if you don't like to talk about conservation and policy all day then DO NOT take this class or Dr. Bailey. Haven't learned anything. Tests are written.
I hated this class with a passion. You don't really even need to show up because he goes over random material. He does not have a syllabus, so he reminds you two days before that you have an exam. There are outlines and study goals on BB, and make sure you take online quizzes. You can take tests with other people and receive a better grade.
This class is ridiculous! You literally learn EVERYTHING in lab. Going to lecture is a big waste of time. The exams are somewhat similar to the work you do in lab so a good way to study for exams are to go over those. This lab uses Minitab which only works on Windows, so if you have a MAC you have to do your homework/study on a computer in the lib.
Professor Bailey is such a great guy. Attendance is not mandatory and I didn't go often because he usually does get off topic a lot. Every test we were allowed a full sheet of paper front and back filled with notes making it extremely easy. Contrary to what everyone says, this is such an easy class and I highly recommend taking it with him.
You don't need to show up to class to pass. He is a very boring professor, and he never lectures about anything important. He'll go off topic and talk about his life, rather than talk about what is going to be on the exam. He tends to cram the class period before the exam, but his tests are super easy and just based off of the online quizzes.
Dr. Baileys lectures are beyond boring and showing up to class in not necessary AT ALL. He rambles on a lot about things that aren't biology related and you wont really learn anything. Online quizzes are easy and exam questions are taken directly from the quizzes. He kind of can be rude but he's cool if you at least ACT like you care about class
Bailey is honestly a pretty funny guy, but he wasn't very good at teaching. I went to the lecture for the first two weeks of class and then didn't step foot into the room until the final. As long as you go to lab and study for exams, lecture is not mandatory.
Lectures were a drag, it really doesn't matter if you go or not, just on exam days. and Lab. Nothing useful to hear
He is a pretty easy going guy and wants everyone to do well. However to get much out of this class you need to PARTICIPATE in discussion during lectures. Pretty much everyone in the back sat on their phones all semester &amp; that's their problem. He did put grades in for our group projects, he just did that last you can see them on blackboard now.
This class was a joke. By the end of the semester, we had grades for two things; a midterm and a final. There were two group projects involved in this course, but I never saw a grade for either one. Never took notes, not even one. I showed up to maybe a quarter of the classes and got an A.
His tests were hard but you got to use a full sheet of paper front and back for every exam. He was nice and an easy teacher.
Professor Bailey's lectures are interesting and informative but they don't correlate with the lab at all. Show up for class or you might miss a pop quiz, most of the quiz material is basic though so its easy to get a good grade in the class. DO YOUR WEEKLY JOURNALS or you will basically fail your final exam, that is all. . .
Bailey gets off topic a lot. You don't need to attend class to pass, you can skip and still get an A or a B. He doesn't really teach biology related stuff. He is very nice though.
Very easy class, but Bailey usually gets off topic during lecture. Attendance isn't required nor necessary in order to do well. All exams are collaborative &amp; you can use a cheat sheet. I showed up to maybe 5 lectures all semester and did just fine.
Nice man but never actually teaches you anything. Class felt like a waste of time with group work and online quizzes. The entire semester he did not post any grades until the very end so you never knew where you stood until the final grade was posted.
At first I was a little hesitant taking this class; I was thinking it just wouldnt be for me. I started to look forward to going to his class. Bailey allows his students to voice their opinions, and to discuss topics in a friendly environment.  In all I always felt like I was motivated to look at biology from a new diverse perspective.
He did not teach or give organized lectures throughout the semester.  He uses Mastering quizzes to teach the material, but does not EVER give an organized lecture.  I never once took notes because any notes you take are not relevant to your success.  You have two group projects in all and most class periods are used to work on them.
Bailey is an extremely easy professor, you don't even have to attend the lecture to pass. However, he is extremely unclear about assignments and very unhelpful outside of class. I'm also annoyed that I spent money on the book just for the Mastering Biology code. I wouldn't take a class with him again even though it is an easy A.
I never went to lecture and got a 98% in the class. But ALWAYS show up to your lab because you'll get assignments. Just figure out what days to show up for the exams!! All exam questions are from your online quizzes :)
Literally all you have to do is show up the day of the exams and they're collaborative, if you're looking for an easy A, take this class!!!!

Teacher comments: 
The absolute most boring prof ever. Expect naps. Every. Day. Nice and sometimes funny though, not difficult at all.
he will put you to sleep but you cannot skip because he gives up to 10 points daily on a little paragraph you write at end of class. overall not to hard and I even slept like everyday and still got my points. 2 essays out of class, also not too bad
If you don't plan on falling asleep every lecture, RUN! Super nice guy but extremely boring. 2 hour lectures of either talking or watching super old, boring films. We turn in note cards after every lecture worth 10 points, so if you plan on skipping you will fail. The note cards is basically your entire grade excluding the 2 papers that he assigns.
Nice guy, but his lectures are very long and boring. I fell asleep often. He has quizzes at the end of each class which count as your attendance so if you like to skip class a lot, I wouldnt suggest this for you.
Absolutely no tests except the final. There are 2 papers which are super easy to get full credit on as long as you read the book for each. Other than that each class has a short note card you fill out and as long as you were awake, that'll be no problem.
I only ever heard bad things about Poindexter but he is not bad at all. If you show up everyday you'll pass. You fill out a notecard everyday which is where a majority of points come from so if you skip you lose 10 points for that day. Only downside is he goes super quick with his slides during lecture &amp; gives a very broad study guide for the final
If you don't plan on coming to class, then don't waste your money by taking this class. He's a boring guy and it was painful to attend but somehow I got the highest grade in his whole lecture class and wrote me a stunning recommendation letter for a scholarship.
If you skip you wont pass. Period.
He teaches like a history lecture. There are notecards at the end of each class every day, which is the majority of your grade. There are 2 essays, but they are pretty easy, just select a chapter and follow the guidelines. He does offer extra credit &amp; it is a discussion class for an hour but we usually get out early.
Loved his lectures even if he gets off topic once in a while. Has like-daily grade cards so dont plan on missing class. Really nice guy &amp; I thought he was funny &amp; interesting.
Lecture's that you can't miss and will put you to sleep. You will have two group presentations and the final exam is close to half of your grade. If you do well with note taking and lectures take him. If not then don't get anywhere near this man.
Poindexter is interesting. His class was meaningful at some points and at others the class really dragged. He's a very qualified professor, however his material sometimes appeared to be more about his own work/experiences. He's very passionate about what he teaches, but I would try to take this class with a different professor.
I took him for BCA210 as a freshman my first semester. There are 2 big group projects (which were fine) but he doesn't give you any exams over the entire semester. THE FINAL EXAM IS WORTH 45% OF YOUR FINAL GRADE! Most A's in the class will change to C's or worse because of it. Choose a different professor if possible.
DO NOT TAKE 210 WITH THIS MAN. RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN. GOOD LUCK
Don't have him if you can avoid it. Taught more like a history class and unclear what the main objective is. He's enthusiastic about the class but comes off as pretentious  and showing off his own achievements in class. I enjoyed what was taught just not how he taught it. The 2 group projects are graded hard and theres a 6 point note card everyday.
Take 210 with Maggie Mayes if possible. Content of class is out of date, feels more like a history class.
If you don't attend class, you will not pass. This professor gives 6 point notecards each and they are not easy questions- you definitely have to pay attention in class or you will not receive a good grade on the notecard and that's the most important part aside from 2 group projects that are also horrible and is 13+ people in each group.. Bad idea
I'm honestly still not sure what this class was about. Very unclear on what was going on the entire semester. notecards everyday so you need to go to class. two group projects you need to do. offers make up assignments and extra credit. easy to pass but waste of time
You have to show up for class participation which is writing on a note card. Hes boring but if you take good notes you will pass the midterm and final.
One of the most dry boring classes I have ever taken at CMU. Watch pointless movies that don't help you learn the material at all. When he does lecture it's long and drawn out, and he goes off on tangents A LOT. Tests are super hard. He really does love the material though, and is a nice guy.

Teacher comments: 
DEFINITELY would not recommend this professor or class to anyone. if you like religion and writing this is for you, but to every other average person, take another class with another professor. HORRIBLE TEACHER.
This professor cares about her students but is the hardest grader. The first half of this course is more of a English course on reading skills. She gives reading quizzes, did not learn much about death and dying, not a very good classs. It is exam week and I still dont know what my grade is because she does not put them into black board.
She really REALLY cares about your success, which is the kind of attitude every professor should have, however she makes you work hard.  Show up for class. Don't buy all the books until absolutely necessary, you most likely won't get through all of them.  I really enjoyed the class, but I didn't enjoy the workload.
She's more concerned with writing and reading skills than anything else. She makes you "read like a detective" and wants you to take various notes. Book and material reading is MANDATORY! Coming to class is mandatory because she stamps your work and that matters in your portfolio at the end of the semester. I worked hard for the grade I received.
She doesn't touch the course material until halfway through the semester. Her grading is very tough because she's unclear when explaining what she wants. She forces her "detective" and "learning strategies" on you claiming they are the best thing ever. If your opinion in your essays are not hers or someone she references, expect a bad grade. Avoid.
This class is definitely not a blow off. The material is difficult and she assigns a lot of writing, but, she is willing to do just about anything to help her students get good grades. Go to office hours and ask questions in class and you won't have a problem.
This professor is what you have nightmares about when dreaming about college. She grades tough, gives way too many busy work assignments, and doesn't clarify anything relevant to religion. I hope you like learning about reading and writing skills because that's the majority of the class. If you can avoid taking this professor, do it. R.I.P my GPA
She is not clear with anything that she wants handed in, she doesn't use letter grades, only the check, plus, minus system like we used when we were 7. She is rude during students presentations.
She doesn't read you're writing all the way through. You will have a ton of homework and assignments but not a lot of grades. It's not listed as writing intensive, but it is. She grades more off of how you write, instead of you're knowledge of your course.
Anyone that has given her a good score is barking mad. I accidentally signed up (2003) as a first semester freshman, something that wasn't  allowed, from what I understood.   Irony of Death and Dying, I had a family member die and the woman lied to me and said I'd get a "W". NOPE, she failed me.   Merlyn ruined my whole perspective on college.
Had to withdraw from the course because by the last week that it was possible to withdraw I still didn't have a grade in the class since she gave my portfolio back ungraded. A shame, 'cause the information was actually interesting. Too bad she's the only one that offers it.
Toughest class I've ever taken but I gained the most from taking it. I do not recommend this class if you're looking for something easy or a blow-off class to fill a U.P.
I took Mowrey years ago; I want to post and let you know that the skills she taught, the ones that everyone thought were "pointless" and "time wasters," have changed how I learn and read...I'm a better student, and have been in grad school and a professional postgrad program.  Don't disregard Mowrey's teaching methods; she is definitely helping!!
Absolutely terrible. She uses the coursework to teach reading skills rather than the actual subject, and the amount of assignments is ludicrous. I'm a decent writer, but this was supposed to be a course on death and dying. Save yourself the trouble and take the class with ANYONE else. She's the worst prof I've ever had throughout my years at CMU.
Dr. Mowrey seems to be much more concerned with showing you how smart she is than with efficiently teaching a class. Her supposed caring attempts at keeping her students from becoming "academically adrift" are ironically alienating. I love reading and I love writing, but her "Detective" strategies are repetitive, time consuming, and mind-numbing.
She is a brilliant woman. She's always willing to give extra help to students. If you want an easy A, this is NOT the class for you. She will make you a better student, thinker, reader and writer if you put the effort in. The material you cover is very interesting. You learn a lot about the subject of death and dying.
Don't waste your time taking this course. The workload is absolutely ridiculous. I understand it's a college course, but it's like she doesn't realize we have jobs and other classes outside of this one. We've never talked about the actual subject of death and dying, only how to "read like a detective." The way she teaches makes me feel like a child
If you are looking to learn about death and dying in this course then you will be disappointed. All you learn about is "reading like a detective". I wish I had never taken this course. She is nice and she means well but its simply not what I expected at all and I am struggling to get by. She gives so much work that is unrelated to death.
For the love of god, don't take her. She uses her classes to shove her "learning strategies" down your throat, and you won't even TOUCH the subject matter. Literally, we haven't even discussed death and dying, just 20 class periods of learning to be "better readers". Save yourself the agony, trust me.
I just don't quite understand who she thinks she is. The class is random theodicies that don't reflect her original ideas just regurgitation of others work. She focused on reading more than death &amp; dying. if that's what you're looking for in a class, don't take this. By far my worst college experience.

Teacher comments: 
This class was awesome! An interesting way to fill out a WI course. There are a few papers along with a research paper, and the class is reading HEAVY, but if you are busy, just buy the audio books! You won't be discouraged to the reading if you just have to listen instead. I hate english classes, and this doesn't feel as basic as reg ENG classes.
He required us to watch "What We Do in the Shadows," for which I will be forever grateful! (Also The Shape of Water--also stellar!) You have to read six novels--not a lot by English class standards, but still time-consuming--but I enjoyed all the books and Jeffrey creates a warm and relaxed atmosphere. Great course!
I took the Monsters and Their Meaning class and the reading was very heavy and you had to get through books quickly. However, Jeffrey was a good teacher who was very passionate about the subject matter and always gave very good feedback on the papers you turn in.
Prof Weinstock is a brilliant man. This course is difficult only in that he requires you to come up with your own arguments rather than telling you what to write. Check in with him before you write and you'll do fine. I really loved the reading and laid back of this class.
Weinstock is very arrogant. Emailed him for feedback on a paper, received his feedback, followed the feedback and it was not to his standards. He seems to have standards for what a paper should be that he does not put on the directions documents on blackboard. Although it was tough to meet his standards, he does keep the class atmosphere relaxed.
Professor Weinstock is very passionate about this course. Although there is a lot of reading for the class, the books are an interesting read. The passion he radiates throughout class discussions and lectures is something that doesnt goes unnoticed. If you do the assigned readings and watch the movies this class will be nothing less than a joy.
If you arent passionate about monsters than this class is not for you. This class is more about race than actual monsters. Professor Weinstock is a very interesting man to listen to but is often times unclear with what he wants on papers. He will mark you down points if its not what he wants, even though often times he doesnt say what we wants.
Very unusual class--students designed the units for the course which considered film, science fiction tv, social media, music, and gaming. Dr. Weinstock found readings for each and provided guidance but it was mostly student-led. I could see this going off the rails, but in this case it turned out well. And we went to see Black Panther!
terrible
I took this course online--which I don't recommend unless you are already a strong writer. Something Dr. Weinstock in a final video stuck with me: "I know I'm demanding but my goal is to make sure you are all prepared to do well in other courses and that a degree from CMU is worth the paper it is printed on." I appreciate this a lot.
Professor Weinstock can be a hard grader but he's very funny and is willing to work with you outside of class. Monsters and Their Meanings is a great class and I would definitely recommend taking it with Weinstock! Communicate with him and you'll do fine!
Professor Weinstock is a very down to earth professor. He often has us sit in a circle with him and structures lectures so its more of a forum and not just him lecturing at us. He is extremely passionate about what he teaches and brings amazing energy to the classroom. He respects everyone in the class and really makes an effort.
Professor Weinstock is very passionate about the material he goes over in class and the discussions are a reflection on that. He gives a lot of options for fulfilling the writing portion of the class, but if you read and work hard you will be okay.
This is a really good class--Dr Weinstock clearly is passionate about it and knows his stuff. Reading was heavy but excellent and discussions were very interesting. He grades closely but lets you revise and if he doesn't know the answer to something researches it and comes back with an answer. I wish I could take fantasy/sf again!
Weinstock is really passionate about the HON201WI. That being said, he didn't space out the assignments very well and many of us often felt overwhelmed. Class is discussion heavy and spends a lot of time focusing on readings. Our class had a personal project, and mine was a dumpster fire because of he was unable to help me. He seems unorganized.
Professor Weinstock was overall a pretty good teacher and I would give him a 3.5 if I could. The only issue I had with him is his expectations about the unit essays he gives were very unclear. Students usually come up with their own topics and sources. Other than that, Monsters and Their Meaning is a very interesting and surprisingly useful class.
Prof. Weinstock is definitely a smart guy and knows a lot about his field, but the class was mostly taught by other students. Papers were very difficult and you will work to get an A. Do not take this prof unless you are already a good writer. He can come off as condescending or curt in emails, but if you take time to meet with him he is helpful.
If you have the chance to take fantasy/sf with Weinstock, you shoudl do it. it's a lot of reading, but its great stuff. Weinstock is funny and you can tell he really enjoys teaching this class. He knows his stuff and the discussions were always great. Theres a lot of writing but it is WI and he is clear with the requirements. It was a great class!
He took the "WI" seriously. Everything was a paper and reading. You write a paper on every book, and a 5000 page paper at the end. He is super strict about writing, but he would try his best to help you. He is very very passionate about fantasy and sf works so if you're not I suggest not taking this class. Every every time consuming.
The fantasy and science fiction course with Dr. Weinstock was my favorite class at CMU. The reading was wonderful and led to very interesting discussions. I recommend this course to anyone who needs a UP class and who likes to read. There is a lot of reading though. Dr. Weinstock is an excellent teacher though he grades hard
Teacher name: King, Donna

Teacher comments: 
Dr. King is a wonderful human and makes Beaver Island courses amazing! Be wary though, they wont be easy. It's a lot of flying through notes and then spending many hours running through them outside of class to really understand what's going on. You'll learn a ton really fast with her, and she's always willing to take extra time for questions.
Okay, so Dr. King was a hard teacher. If you want an easy class, don't take her. However, she has to be one of the most helpful teachers I've ever had at CMU. If you didn't understand something in her class, go to her office hours and talk with her. She'll make sure that you understand it if you just put forth the effort.
Almost 4 years ago I took this class and I will never forget studying 3 nights in a row for 6 hours with a group of friends and getting a C- on the exam. I find it hard to believe the good comments below, most likely posted by her teaching assistants who always had a stick up their... well you know. If you get this class, a word of WISDOM, drop!
Dr. King is a very sweet lady! She will help you out with whatever you may need if you just go and talk to her. Exams are easy if you study her notes. You don't need to buy the book!!
Very, very nice woman that goes out of her way to help you if you put forth the slightest bit of effort. It is not hard to pass the class if you show up. you don't even have to read the textbook. just pay attention to the examples she she mentions in class and how many beagles she has.
Dr. King is kind of crazy yet she is not a bad teacher. She knows what she is talking about and gives you a lot of diagrams to explain information. Class is pretty mandatory because you won't understand her diagrams unless you go and she gives little in class assignments regularly. Quizzes are very hard but exams aren't too bad.
Very unorganized and scatter brained. Literally asks you to "use your imagination" to take exams and quizzes. GO TO CLASS because she quizzes without notice and this will hurt your grade. Read the book, because questions on exams are randomly picked out from the book. Exams are difficult, her powerpoints are confusing, don't take her.
Dr. King is terrible. Seriously do everything in your power to get out of her class if you have her. She goes over nothing that is on the exams, you basically have to teach yourself the material. Information from the book is on the exam but you are told not to bring the book to class. I cannot give one positive comment about her.

Literally the worst professor I have ever had.  Her powerpoints seem to only make sense to her, and she flies through them like we can write a million words a minute.  The exams are extremely difficult, and even after studying for countless hours I still felt I knew nothing when it came time for the exam.  If you want to lower your GPA, get Dr King
Donna King is a terrible TEACHER  she has the worst and most unclear notes. The exams often have more difficult and unrelated questions than what is learned in class. Recommend finding another professor.
I felt like Dr. King was very passive aggressive.  She seemed to think that we all needed to be experts in the class.  The exams were EXTREMELY difficult.  I DO NOT recommend her.
Dr. King is a kind hearted lady. She really means well and wants the best out of us. However, her teaching needs some revision. Powerpoints need some clarity. She gives out handouts that are scrambled and make no sense. Lab definitely helps grade. Also, attend class. Frequent group discussion that are graded. Recommend, but study more than notes.
Dr. King is a horrible bio teacher. All she talks about is her beagles and even puts pictures of them in her slides. She is always off topic and doesnt handle classes well. She walks out if people do not understand or if shes too upset. Take someone else!!! her teaching is sure to lower your gpa. The only good part is the lab
Donna is very passionate about biology and means well, but just doesn't explain things very well, shows VERY confusing powerpoints and tells stories unrelated to the class. The lab is super easy though and really helps your grade! I wouldn't take this professor, she makes the class a lot harder than it needs to be.
The worst prof ive ever encountered
Worst BIO teacher ever. The only thing you will get out of this class is knowledge about her damn beagles and beaver island. She needs to retire.
Honestly you are asking for failure if you keep her has a teacher.. Literally psychotic. Awful at explaining things and quits if you don't understand it the first time.. By far the worst teacher I have ever had..ever.
She is hard, and talks about Beaver Island and her dogs ALL THE TIME! Gives tons on pop quizzes and doesn't hand back any homework she assigns (so you don't know your grade ever) Rarely uses blackboard....
this is not a professor this is not even a human being i cannot stand her and if i were the dean of CMU i would force her to retire to go out with pride or i would fire her. she is the worst teacher i have ever had in my life refuses to see things at your view she is always right and doesnt care if u pass fail or drop this class. DONT EVEN DO IT
Teacher name: Lanfear, Carol
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I took her Calc 2 class 11 yrs ago &amp; still have her lectures today.  She was "old school" but effective.  She didn't use a textbook and wrote all her lectures from memory - when I took her class I felt like I had to fully listen and be present.  It was obvious she cared for her work and that enthusiasm translated to her effectiveness.  I loved it!
I'll try to be specific: Carol's world revolves around two things, Christianity and math.  Since she's not teaching religion, she teaches math, and she can't bring it down to the level of the Calc 101 student.  She immediately jumps into *application* rather than helping students understand and get the basics down first.  Nice lady, poor teacher.
I'm reading these posts roughly 15 years after taking Lanfear for Calc II and would say that it's amazing that nothing has changed in that time.  The reviews of her style perfectly describe her from all the way back then.  As an alum, I think it's pathetic that she's still teaching at my alma mater...&amp; yes, we did complain about her back then too.
Before taking class, I thought I was pretty good in Math but now I am not so sure.  The test was very difficult.  It was hard to study for  this class.  The professor was not very helpful.  I failed this class and I amlooking into taking it at a community college, I am sure I will pass.  The professor really needs to change to method of teaching.
She is one of the worse professors ever! She grades unfair and doesn't want to help you if you need assistance or have questions. She is mean and I suggest NOT taking her course!
She is the a horrible professor! She makes all her tests inpossible to pass and you can never pass even if you studied 50 hours a week! Warning-- Do not take her! She will only fail you!
Ew! Horrible class. The teacher is not evil or especially mean, I had this class online so I never saw her in person so she could be different in person... however, she is not a good teacher. She gave us no notes during the entire semester and wasn't very helpful. She pretty much got paid to do nothing! Don't take her for an online class!
i never have done this bad in a class my whole college carrer.  DO NOT SIGN UP FOR HER....TAKE A FOREINGER AS A PROF INSTEAD OF HER
She is oldschool, thats it. She's not mean, in fact shes very nice. She just doesn't understand young people very much in my opinion. I got an A in her trig class, but I had to really work for it. Just try to stay awake and do the homework. Don't forget, CMU has a math center.
How do you think this makes her feel. 38 freakn pages of bad reviews! 38! No other teacher at CMU has more than 10! This is embarasing. A 1.6 average our of 5 one being the lowest. WOW! Somebody needs to adjust a little bit.  I'm not trying to be mean but there are more than just a couple of sour grapes here.  There are 38 pages of them.
You guys are so dramatic. She is not the devil, nor a Nazi or even the worst teacher at Central. She has a rough demeanor but she respects students who try and is very willing to help those who ask. She's fast paced so if your math skill is poor take another teacher. Otherwise if you do your hw, ask questions and really try you'll do just fine.
she is really boring
lanFEAR- She is really disrespectful to students. She does a great job making you feel dumb-actually called me dumb. If you struggle in MTH what-so-ever then go to Mid. She has this math homework thing online and its really a pain to use. She has actual projects plus homework. Plus she has a DRESS CODE!
i have been attending central michigan for 6 years. i have taken numerous classes, carol lanfear is the worst teacher i have ever had in my life. I took this class at a community college and got an A. I took it with her and got a D. I dont see any reason why she still has her job.
Well i had her my freshman year and reading comments like these just brings back the horrible memories... She is a horrible prof and threatened to take me to the dean because i looked in the back of the book for an answer... if she knew how to teach maybe i wouldnt have done that... needs to roll over and die!! seriously
She's a nice women but its n extremely hard class.  She makes it look easy in class, then you do your homework and it is nothing like what she just taught you.  Do not take this class with her...it will kill you GPA.
Taking this class could be close to the worst thing you could do for your college career. You will NOT be successful ever. Tests are nothing at all like homework.  I would not wish this class on my worst enemy.
She is just really annoying. When she goes over anything in class she talks and writes too fast so it's impossible to follow. When you raise your hand in class, she never calls on you. It is almost impossible to learn anything in her class. I wouldn't recommend her, but if she is your last option, it is possible to learn everything from math XL.
AS SOON AS YOU FIND OUT THAT SHE'S TEACHING YOUR CLASS, DROP IT IMMEDIATELY! Expect to be confused, frustrated, and let out late every single day. Instead of actually teaching, she does crazy math problems for her own fun and will keep you late just so she can get some form of sick pleasure from solving equations. RUN FOR THE HILLS IF YOU GET HER!
I hate my life due to this ****
Teacher name: Babcock, Renee
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I stopped going to lectures because she did not give any more information than the textbook and homework quizzes did. She does not make her own exams or powerpoints and gets them from the website that the textbook and homework are on. She does not show up for exam days and TAs grade everything. Easy class if you do the homework.
In PSY 220, Dr. Babcock does everything you need her to. She goes over powerpoints and lectures that pertain to the book (it is an online Revel Textbook) and take online quizzes and tests from that book. The class is overall very straightforward and easy if you do the work.
Babcock is a good prof. The online book has easy tests and quizzes. Once in awhile she gives extra credit for coming to class but you don't need to go to lecture. As long as you get your work done and study for the tests you'll be all set.
To be completely honest, I stopped attending this class a month ago. I went to the first couple of lectures and she's great. Super friendly and knows what she's talking about. But if you read the book, take the quizzes, and take the exam (all online) you'll literally be fine. I don't even bother to show up and I've had an A semester.
She's passionate about what she's teaching and always makes sure to give examples to clarify ideas. If you pay attention, you're guaranteed an A. She keeps lectures interesting. There are quizzes online before each exam, but the work isn't hard. There are a few mini essays that you'll have to write.
Easy online class as long as you read the online textbook. Lots of points available through the online text to help boost your grade. Offers two chances at online exams with lockdown browser, and there is no final exam! Don't even need to view the powerpoints, just read the text. Weekly discussion board, and a couple of writing assignments.
Great lady. Lecture heavy but she is very nice and obviously cares about her students. Online textbook needed, with LOTS of quizzes to go with, not too hard though. Couple papers assigned, exams online with lockdown browser. Also, 2 current events which aren't hard. Prof. Babcock is a solid choice.
A lot of people take psychology, and I would highly recommend Professor Babcock. Her lectures were not mandatory, but I never missed a lecture because they were really interesting and it was easier than having to read the book. Weekly quizzes that can be difficult if you don't put in a little effort. Very friendly and very funny.
She was one of the best professors I have had so far. Has straight forward lectures with power points to fill out with notes that are directly on the exams. Online homework is a huge grade booster and super easy.
Babcock is an easy instructor. You do not need to come to class but beware: some things she shows in class shows up on the exams. All work is online via REVEL (buy the access code which includes the book). Offers good extra credit. Easy A class. She can be boring and routine though because she reads directly off the power points.
Incredible! By far one of the most understanding, relatable professors I have ever had. She tries to meet our needs by being very flexible, but not too flexible where she is taken advantage of. Honestly, if you just do your homework and average C's on the exams you will most likely end up around an A- or B grade in class. Recommend.
Amazing lectures/power points. Do the assignments on REVEL and the discussion boards! Exams can be taken twice with no final. She responds to emails quickly
There is a lot of homework for this class, but if you pay attention to her lectures they  are pretty simple! It looks like way more work than it truly is! I absolutely loved professor Babcock! She kept her lectures interesting and related things to our lives to make it easier to understand the info! Fave class by far! Totally recommend :)
Babcock is a great professor for PSY100. Lectures are optional, although I would recommend going to take notes off her PowerPoints. The Revel homework assignments make up the majority of your grade, so as long as you can do well on those, you can definitely get an A in the class. She's really sweet and understanding &amp; I would definitely recommend!
Dr. Babcock is amazing professor! I really enjoyed her lectures. PSY 220 was a very easy class, just make sure to do the homework and show up for lecture. The textbook is online. Also she doesn't make her students take a final!
You don't need the book just the access code for homework/quizzes online. I never studied outside the assignments online and got a B+. Prof Babcock adds relatable/relevant content to lectures so they're always interesting. She's very approachable and easy to talk to. Definitely a "mom" type prof, even in a large lecture class.
I liked the lectures because they were very interesting but the exams were pretty hard. Spend time on the online quizzes because those are a big part of the grade.
Class with Dr. Babcock is always interesting and she gives plenty of opportunities for questions and open discussion. Do not do homework the night before the exam.
you can get any grade above a C if you take notes in class or get them from a friend. She also gives a study guide a couple of days before the exams which is very helpful.
I enjoyed her class. As long as you stay up on the reading and do well with the online quizzes and papers you will be prepared for the exam. It isn't necessary to attend lecture but it definitely helps. She enjoys conversations about the topics and is more than willing to work out any issues with you. Great!
Teacher name: Gibson, Bryan
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Prof Gibson is a great teacher who tells you exactly what you need to do in order to pass the class. His lectures are very important, and if you miss one, you'll have a lot of catching up to do. He is, however, quite funny and clearly loves what he does, and he gives off good vibes during class. Not an easy class, but definitely worth taking.
terrible
There are quizzes over what we learned every other week. Overall the class isn't too hard but you should do reading on your own despite the lectures in class. He provides practice quizzes and study materials on blackboard to help. Overall a very good class.
I actually enjoyed him a lot. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT! It is a safety blanket for you if you are failing/struggling in the class! My rough estimate of my grade for this semester lies on a C+. With the extra credit it bumped me to a B-! Pay attention in class, lecture and text count for quizzes! Do NOT miss out, you are basically screwed!
Dr. GIbson is a great guy, very knowledgeable in the subject. However, the class involves 7 quizzes and in order to score well on them you HAVE to read the chapters. The final is optional and if you take the final he will drop your two lowest quiz grades. Good luck!
Gibson is a rally smart guy, and his teaching style is exactly what I expected coming into college. Very lecture based. 7 quizzes, 2 lowest get dropped. Those are your only grades so make sure you study. Quizzes are over the material he teaches in class, and two chapters in the book. If you study, go to class, and don't be lazy... you'll be fine.
His lectures make little sense. He goes off on tangents every class which makes it really hard to follow the lecture notes. He's a little bit crazy as well. Don't speak your opinion on anything politics related because you WILL get yelled at and have a big debate in class. you would think its easy bc of the 100 level class but nope. good luck
Dr. Gibson is a very interesting man. He has a lot of stories to tell and loves to tell them. Although when it comes to lectures, be prepared to write so fast that your hand will feel like it is falling off. He flies through his power points. He does give extra credit opportunities. Tests are extremely hard if you do not study.
Gibson is very interesting however I study very hard for tests and do not do very well. He gives lots of extra credit opportunity and going to class is not mandatory.
Prof Gibson is very knowledgeable and very interesting to listen too. His lectures are very helpful and important so you should go every time. Buy the book and read it or else you wont do well. Also utilize his practice quizzes they are extremely helpful for the actual quizzes!
Not a psych major or minor or anything, but I loved his lectures. Very interesting &amp; exciting to learn about. Buy and read the textbook!!! He shares good online resources-use them! Tests are only hard if you dont study.
I took this class via the online format. It was a very interesting class with relevant projects, interesting videos and assignments to supplement the materials, and plenty of study guides and options for extra credit. I found Dr. Gibson to be prompt in responding to e-mailed questions and he gave serious attention and good detail in his responses.
Dr. Gibson seemed to be very knowledgeable in the field of social psych, but his way of presenting material was somewhat difficult to comprehend. His class was 100% lecture and they got lengthy/boring. Bullet points on his slides were unclear and made taking notes difficult. Study hard for exams since they make up most of grade. Lots of ex credit!
Course was poorly taught. Tests were based on material not found in textbook or lectures. Quiz every week. Class three times a week. Attendance not mandatory but if you miss you're lost. Not accessible, was not willing to help students other than the EX-C opportunity (taking a PSY survey for use by a different class).
Great professor! Quite intimidating at first, but not that bad as we got into the semester. VERY lecture heavy and lectures fast, but go to the lectures, attendance isn't taken, therefore not mandatory, but if you go to the lectures you won't even need the textbook. Utilize the short answer questions and practice quizzes given. Lots of extra credit
Real simple for PSY100 find someone else, you have to read a min 30 pages a week and take hard notes in class to get a decent grade, he is very rude, but make sure you check the syllabus cause he might screw you over with 1 of his many exceptions to his own rules.
Quizzes every Friday but they are very easy &amp; you get to drop your 2 lowest scores. The final exam is optional. Tons of extra credit opportunities. Do the practice quizzes on blackboard because they are almost identical to the actual quiz. He also gives you the short answer question that will be asked on the quiz.
Going to be as fair. Gives u 8% extra credit if your willing to put forth work. Bryan after that is complete aids and i recommend you kys if you take this class. REQUIRED to show up to class unless your very smart, his 2 students love to take off 2point off your short answer questions so you at max get 90% and chances are you arent getting an A.
Professor Gibson is a easy teacher to have. He's funny and gives very interesting lectures. You seriously don't have to show up for any of the lectures. He puts all the power points online and just buy the book and you can home-teach yourself. I got a B, but I could have easily gotten an A and probably showed up to class probably 35% of the times
He is one of the funnest and funniest profs I think i'll ever have. Please show up t class and take notes and you'll do fine on his weekly quizzes.
Teacher name: Neurath, James
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Wasn't always clear, quizzes were somewhat challenging, grades based on participation. He answered questions pretty well. Not a bad professor. Ended up curving the grade. If there's an SI, go to the sessions.
The class (ACC 201) is straight forward, assuming you come every day. The content builds on itself. If you miss a class you have to make sure you do over the notes but he will do problems in the near future and if you can do those you will pass with b+ or higher.
This class is very hard. Neurath automatically assumes you're just as knowledgeable as he is at accounting. Our SI quit and he didn't get a new one, just saying come to his office hours if you have problems. The problem is if you ask him for help, he doesn't actually answer your question or give you anything to work with. Horrible professor.
This is one of those accounting classes that you have to study your butt off and the class averages on tests are 65%. But, Neurath is a very nice guy and has a lot of experiences from his current job that he can use to relate the material to real life. I really respect him and enjoyed learning about tax, even though my GPA will be taking a hit.
Very hard class and homework is not graded. A lot of time outside of class is needed to be put into understanding the material well. Miss a class you might as well find someone who can teach you the material otherwise you will fall behind quickly and get lost.
He is a good teacher as long as you pay attention and follow along. You have to show up to class and you have to participate in order to get a good grade in the class. He really does know what he is talking about and he is a very nice guy. Try hard in the class and you will do fine.
If you're not an Accouting major, I wouldn't take it with Neurath. He goes through the material quickly and if you skip a day you might as well just read the entire book on your own. Examples are out of the textbook and the homework is NOT graded. Hard class if you're not organized. I would suggest taking this class with Credit/No Credit.
Neurath is able to breathe some life into a very cut-and-dry subject. Lectures, though certainly not riveting, are mixed in with a touch of his personality and that goes a long way sometimes. Quizzes and exams are tough but fair. He is a very nice man and was accessible outside class. Do your reading!!
This class has its own study sessions, I ADVISE YOU GO. I HAVE GONE TO EVERY STUDY SESSION AND IM BARELY ABOVE A 75 percent. if you feel like working hard, take this class. Neurath is a pretty cool dude but the class is hard as crap. If you have to take this for your major, then good luck
He knows what he is talking about. You aren't necessarily required to come to class but he takes attendance and if you do not come you will feel like you fall very far behind. He has office hours and encourages you come if help is needed.  He enjoys the subject. Would recommend taking this course with him.
In James' class expect to show up and take notes everyday. All the test questions are from the lecture and notes. Not too many notes to take though. He's very understandable and goes at a reasonable pace. Would definitely take him for accounting classes. He won't teach you anything you don't need to know for future courses.
Horrible horrible professor. I had a 3.7 gpa before entering this class and he gives no graded homework, and no extra credit. You get 4-5 quiz's the entire semester and 4 exams. The last 2 exams are within 8 days of each other. If you fail the first exam, you might as well withdraw from the class because you're screwed. Doesnt use blackboard either
He gives clear expectations and if you just listen to him and ask questions he'll make sure you pass with an A. He's a really cool guy
Overall easy class. Do the homework and participate and you should be fine. Tests are multiple choice and short answer.
He isn't as hard as people on here are making him out to be. Attendance and participation are factored into your grade. Bring textbook to class! Gives you participation points for asking questions. Exams and quizzes were fair. Go to the SI sessions if you need extra help. He made it very easy to pass if you put in the effort.
The Professor believes every student is as knowledgeable as he is and holds you to those standards. Lectures consist of only going over the homework you did the night before and clarifying a few things. Tests are hard and not really like the homework whatsoever so I would encourage that you attending SI sessions every week.
I had to retake the this course because I did so terrible the first time. However, I realized that it's only because you really have to get used to his style. Tests were sometimes worded in such a way that answers could go other ways, and one time a quiz answer contradicted the textbook's definition. He simply just said the textbook was wrong... ?!
By far worst class and worst professor I have ever had at central. Very condescending  and rude. Do not take him save yourself.
I wouldn't expect anything different for an undergraduate accounting class. Focused on teaching us the material that matters and removing material that wouldn't benefit us. Assigns homework but doesn't grade it. The homework is really helpful and practical. He will get touchy if he notices his class isn't doing it, though.
Worst teacher I have ever had at CMU. Cares more about his tax job than students.  Expects you to already know what he is talking about and knows about taxes. Barely any office hours. Doesn't use email. Only grades 4 exams and 2 projects. Takes attendance every class and marks grade down every class you miss. TERRIBLE DO NOT TAKE!
Teacher name: Blystone, Kathy
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Doesn't give reviews for tests its all based on the assisgnments she gives as practice.
Exams are hard and she is very strict about phones and laptops it distracts from her lectures.
Kathy is a great prof, too bad the university is letting her go. I will never understand CMU's logic, because she was one of the greatest prof's I have ever had.
Professor Blystone could possibly be the best professor at CMU. Very memorable lectures, always available for extra help, and an all around nice person. I wish Prof. Blystone taught more classes!!!
Kathy was the best professor that I've ever had at CMU. VERY hands-on which helps a lot and she's very passionate about what she teaches. She made me enjoy chemistry a lot more than I did before taking this class. Don't take if you want to sit on your phone the whole time... she will kick you out of class. Don't buy the textbook.
Kathy is one of my favorite professors at CMU. Only buy the workbook for labs (which are easy and help your grade,) you won't need the textbook at all. Do the study guides and take the extra credit quizzes and it's impossible not to get an A. Very fun class, even if you aren't interested in chem!
Hated chemistry but this class wasn't bad. Can get very boring, but she does a good job of keeping it interesting. Do Pre-labs and Labs, extra credit helps a lot. Don't buy the text book!!
Kathy is an amazing professor. She is very passionate about the subject so it is very easy to learn from her. Her exams are always 60 MC questions and drops your lowest exam. She also gives a lot of extra credit opportunities. If you can take Kathy's class!
Gives a lot of notes but makes class super easy. Gives examples before almost every exam as well as does experiments to help you learn the material. Super easy labs and pre-labs
AWESOME teacher! Makes you enjoy being in class. Explains things very well and your labs help your grade so much! HIGHLY recommend!!! LOVE her
Loved her! So nice and helpful! Made learning kinda fun! DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK! ONLY THE WORKBOOK!
Make sure you go to class everyday because whatever she lectures will be on the exams. She is a phenomenal teacher and loves what she teaches and does a lot of cool experiments and tells a lot of relatable and cool teachers. The exams I personally thought were pretty tough, just make sure you study a lot and go to her SI sessions!
BEST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD!!!! TAKE HER! She makes learning chemistry so fun and easy! go to class and study and you will get an A!
EASY A IF YOU GO TO CLASS AND DO THE STUDY GUIDES! Kathy does some great in class activities and I really liked this class for a UP. Usually she lectures for 1 hour and then you have a 1 hour lab.Most nights you will have hw, but it is just a page of prelabs. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK. It is worthless, just study the notes.
The highlights of this class included Professor Blystone blowing stuff up and singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" to the class. She's so much fun and the class isn't very difficult if you try to do well.
Great teacher
She is very passionate about the subjects and makes it very interesting. She doesn't ramble and tells us what we need to know and doesn't include useless information. I wouldn't recommend buying the text book because you honestly don't need it. Overall, she's amazing and taking this class was an amazing experience.
I really don't care for chemistry, but Kathy made it interesting. She found a way to make chemistry engaging and applicable to real-life, and you'll learn from this class. You definitely have to go to class, do the homework, and study for the tests. But the homework isn't bad and class is interesting. Pretty good for a required class.
Blysdtone is an amazing professor. She is funny and explains things very well. I loved her. The tests are easy if you study. And she givesd extra credit pop quizzes which help a lot in the end. I would definetely take her again!
If you took/know anything about chemistry, you will be fine. I feel like it is a high school level course. She is a great professor and repeats herself multiple times to drill her lesson into your head. She hates phones though, so dont pull that out if your a texting addict!
Teacher name: Pietrandrea, Lori
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Lori is my absolute favorite! She is always flexible and willing to work with you, and she always makes sure her assignments are not to hard for her students by asking the students themselves. She is always willing to meet to chat, or answer your emails! She is bright, bubbly, and the BEST professor I have ever had!
Lori is a phenominal human being and I hope to one day be 1/5th of the SLP that she is. As someone who has taken numerous classes with Lori, I genuinley feel like she is an expert at what she does. Yes her classes can be hard, but its the material, not the prof. I would die for lori.
Lori is the best!! She has so many great stories that make you so interested in the subject. The class is super lecture heavy so if you miss class you'll be really behind the next class, but she's super helpful and understanding!
Lori is a gem of a professor and if you have they opportunity to take her DO IT. She cares so much about her students and prepares you very well for all of the exams/quizzes.
TONS OF EXTRA CREDIT! Some of the material is tough to master but Lori makes it easy to understand. I loved going to class and I find Lori's lectures to be interesting but the class is lecture heavy.
I have had Lori for 130 and am currently in her 230 class. She is the reason as to why I have changed my major to SLP. She is super passionate about what she does, and has a happy-go-lucky personality. She cares very much about her students, and loves what she does! She makes it fun with how much she loves everything we talk about in her class.
She was very helpful on how to pass the class.
Lori is one of the nicest profs I've had at CMU. This class fulfilled a UP for me, so I only took it because I heard it was an easy A, which it was! The class is lecture heavy, with weakly assignments to be submitted, but besides that, it should be a breeze. Lori also give a ton of extra credit, so you really have to TRY to fail... Would recommend.
Lori is a great professor for anyone interested in CDO. She is very caring and makes class very interesting and fun. I would definitely recommend taking her if you get the chance!
She is one of my favorite CDO profs!! She is so amazing and passionate about SLP, it makes her lectures so interesting!! Her quizzes and exams are pretty straight forward.
She's a great prof and very understanding!
Super sweet and cares about her students. Multiple opportunities for extra credit and she gives you a study guide as well. this class should be an easy A
I love Lori! She is an amazing professor. She honestly has so much experience in the field. I feel like I learned more hearing stories about what she did than the class itself. CDO 230 is basically an over view of the mayor and she did and amazing job at teaching it! I would take any class if she taught it!
Lori was a blast to have my first semester of school. She is such a wonderful instructor and she made me want to further my learning in communication disorders.
Lori was such a helpful professor and she really liked to have relationships with her students. There were tests but they weren't hard if you studied. Her lectures were really interesting and I loved going to class.
Lori is an amazing professor.  Her lectures are extremely clear and very interesting.  The exams are very much like the lectures and powerpoints.  I would not recommend getting the textbook because we don't need it, everything you need will be in the notes and powerpoints. I would totally recommend taking this class.
Lori is the best professor I've had at CMU so far! She works part time at the Midland hospital &amp; part time at CMU &amp; she has all kinds of stories. Her exams are easy if you study your notes. Make sure you show up to classes that are expected to have low attendance (days before breaks, St. Patty's) because she gives out extra credit for showing up.
Amazing, beautiful, and intelligent. All words said too often, yet never enough in the context of one woman: Lori. Super smart and very encouraging, I would recommend this and any class taught by her because she makes things very easy to understand and uses real world examples like films to aid in class.
Lori is awesome, she is so much help and does such a great job. tests are pretty hard so just make sure you study ahead of time. Theres a big group project towards the end of the semester so pick a good group. She is such a great help!
Love Lori! Best in the CDO field in my opinion. She is so passionate about her profession and it comes off in class. I have her at 8am, but she lightens my morning! Cheesy, but seriously. She's so helpful and move at a steady pace. Study HARD and USE THE TEXTBOOK (learned that the hard way) It will start out hard, but get a little easier.
Teacher name: Shelton, Mark
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
If you are not gifted and brilliant, skip this class.
There is so much reading for this class. He goes over the reading extensively in class, but if you don't do the reading, you are most likely not going to do well in the class.
My opinions on him are very mixed. You will learn a lot from his classes, but they are pretty difficult, easily the most difficult class I've taken. He's a very smart and caring person, but I do not like how his class is organized.
Loved the Prof. but way to smart for an intro class to understand. Get ready to read and not understand lectures! Any papers assigned and are difficult to understand his questions. I have never missed a class but struggle and literally don't get what we talk about. He is funny but again a really tough intro class!
I had such a difficult time in this class. He overcomplicates his sentences during his lectures in such a way that I couldn't focus enough to even take notes that made sense, and I'm currently writing my final paper for this class and teaching myself the material. He's a very kind and approachable man, but I struggled to follow his teaching style.
The material was pretty hard to understand most of time, professor shelton is also more than happy to go over anything that you found challenging. The one downside that i found was the online homework was challenging and confusing most of the time, once you submit it you don't recieve correct answers to the ones you got wrong.
He is kind and very easy to talk to. Lectures are like mini-seminars, although he talks more than the students do. Often he is more interested in what you are thinking about the material rather than if you have the "correct" answer. There are 8 small question/response papers every 2-3 weeks, 600 word min. Very unique class and professor.
Professor Shelton is a great guy. It is very evident from his lectures that he is very passionate on the subject. He cares for his students and is a really nice guy. There are a lot of books you SHOULD read for the papers he has you write about them. The papers are not difficult, only 600 word assignments mostly for completion. Good luck!
Dr. Shelton was a very passionate professor. He would really get into his lectures, and you can tell he is passionate about the subject. If you take PHL100, I would 100% suggest him. The work isn't plentiful, one 500-600 word assignment every other week with only every other one graded, your choice. Easy A if you follow the requirements listed well
Really really liked this class and the prof but he is such a hard grader. I participated and paid close attention every day and took good notes and still ended with a C+. Ruined my gpa
Mr. Shelton is a fantastic professor. He's funny, smart, and clearly enthusiastic about the subject. The way he grades is different, but overall great. He makes it so that the exams are hard, but grades in a way that even if you get only half right you pass the exam. Read, show up, and you'll pass.
This guy is a great person and really cares about his students. If you don't understand something, go and see him at his office hours. I will admit he is a tough grader and says it is hard to get an A in his class. Put in the work, start caring about what you're learning and it's absolutely possible!
He's awesome, it's one thing to go to class and it's another to go and learn something. If you're true goal is to learn something and you're not solely focused on getting an A every time. You will love it, please take this class. We need more people who know stuff in the world!
He's very enthusiastic about what he teaches. He's wicked smart and moral problems is already a rough class so it might be hard for you to follow. It wasn't necessarily easy but it wasn't hard either. If you're struggling, ask questions because it will only get harder if you don't. Do the reading. Just do the reading he assigns.
A very dedicated and caring professor. He makes great analogies and explains things in very understandable terms. Prepare to get deep on subjects. Read weekly, it's not overbearing material. If you work hard you should be able to get a B- or higher. Definitely grew from the class, interesting all around.
Holy Cow, this class sure does make you work for a good grade. Not in the good way though. If you have the option to take a different class for a WI I would definitely suggest it. He is not very clear in his grading so you do not always know your grade. On all of my papers he wrote letter grades. No percentages just A-/B+. Literally what he wrote.
Despite interesting material and engaging lectures, I can't really recommend this class or professor. This might work for someone who is an English major or a Philosophy Major, but I am majoring in Meteorology. Science is objective while philosophy is subjective. Therefore, if you are a Science major, steer clear at all costs.
He is very intelligent and nice, but the material was presented in such a difficult way.  Lectures can be confusing and boring.  Since he goes over the readings in class, you cant skip and you have to do all the readings beforehand to be able to participate.  I would highly recommend NOT taking this class if it is for a UP!
Loved this class! I would Recommend it.
He is a very quirky and smart guy, and if you can follow, his lectures will be interesting and the logic of it all will make perfect sense. He cares about his students and challenges your beliefs. This is my first semester as a freshman and I have an A- with minimal effort. Do the readings beforehand and pay attention and you will do fine.
Teacher name: Coffey, Matthew
School name: Central Michigan University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Mr. Coffey does not use slides or handouts to supplement his lectures, and in many law classes under many instructors, this would lead to confusion. However, he is a dynamic speaker who contextualizes each term or concept mentioned and has a way of crafting a narrative when speaking. I learned a great deal about employment law and would take again.
I would definitely recommend this class. Coffey is a great teacher who makes difficult topics very easy to understand. The class is a little lecture heavy, but if you take good notes you will do good. Although, he doesn't post grades on blackboard, so you have to ask him about your grades. Im expecting an A in the class!
Incredibly easy to get a B but you have to go the extra mile for an A. Coffey makes lectures interesting and keeps your attention. He tells you what the questions will be on exams so you know exactly what to study for. You don't need the expensive textbook, everything you need is a google search away. Not accessible outside of class, doesn't use BB
Dr. Coffey made Racial Diversity through Law easy to understand and interesting. Exams are all essay based, but not difficult by any means. If you go to lecture and take notes, it is not hard to do well in his class.
No need for the book. He explains everything you need to know during a lecture just take notes. Tells you exactly what is on test but can be a little tough grading them. Overall great guy very nice and seems to care about subject and students.
I seriously loved this professor. He was very straight forward and only gave you the information you NEEDED. My favorite thing about him was you could literally send him a text and he'd meet with you, go over your exams, and if you can validate your answers and prove your thinking, he'll give you the points back. He likes hard workers :)
Professor Coffey is a great lecturer. What I did not like, however, was the fact that he does not keep you updated on your grades (nothing was posted to blackboard our entire semester). All tests are writing based. I do not feel that I got a fair enough grade for the amount of effort that I put into this WI class. Also textbook was written by him.
Coffey is an amazing professor. There aren't many quizzes or exams but they are relatively easy if you show up to class and pay attention. Points are given for attending lecture as well so it is easy to get an A as long as you put in the effort.
I really enjoyed this class and his teaching. He's quite a hottie and a very good lecturer, my only complaint is he's a very old school lecture. I wish he would have made powerpoints, but very good overall and would take again!
So I had to take this class to graduate because its a university requirement and my major doesn't have anything to do with law. However, I loved this class and I loved Coffey. One of the best professors I had so for and he's a hottie. Definitely recommend taking this class with him... lets you out early and is super understanding if you miss.
One of the best classes I have ever taken! As long as you take all the notes you will pass the tests He tells you what's on the exams so they are not hard at all. Don't really use the textbook so there is no need to waste your money.
This was one of my favorite professors at CMU. He is genuine, respectable, and knowledgable. Lectures are very important so show up and get engaged. Take thorough notes and study them. Make sure how to explain things discussed  and go the extra steps to get a good grade. He is very helpful and great at teaching. A+
I am not interested in anything related to politics or history of the law, but Professor Coffey is one of the most outstanding professors I have ever had. He cares and he makes the lectures really interesting. He is a 10/10 professor.
Professor Coffey is very laid back and understanding. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you aren't there you miss out on his great lectures and actually have to read the book (which is way more confusing). If you miss an assignment (except quizzes and tests) just send it to him in an email and he'll likely accept it. Great professor overall.

Amazing professor, show up  to class and he gives you all the answers and walks through all the cases. homework is  done for credit. I'm a science major  and i don't even mind  going to  this class.
Very good Professor. He really cares about you learning the topic and not just memorizing it. He dumbs it down but also keeps it interesting. It is clear he wants students to do well in the class.
AMAZING professor. Very clear lectures and provides much information. Would recommend time and time again. Took him 3 times throughout my years.
Old school but teaches a great class. Show up, listen to his interesting lectures, &amp; take good notes over them. Don't buy the book you don't need it. Passes around an attendance sheet. Exams and quizzes are essay format but easy if you go to class. Just apply the rule of the law during the time period. No homework ever. Never saw a grade below a B-
Coffey's lectures were very interesting and easy to pay attention to. You definitely need to go to class to pass. You don't really need to book if you don't want to purchase it; he goes over all the cases in detail in class. Tests are tough, and he is difficult to get a hold of for extra help.  However, he is very nice and respectful.

Norma is my spirit animal.
Norma is the best professor out there. She is patient, understanding, kind, considerate, and great at her job. She has a passion for teaching that is contagious. She  makes you want to run out of her classroom and go teach a class right away. Truly inspirational. Take her if you can!
Norma is an amazing professor. She cares about all of her students and her main goal is to teach you what it means to be a teacher. The homework is easy and she is very understanding if you forget an assignment or something. If you can, take her class! I cant say enough good about her.
BEST PROFESSOR EVER! She really exposes you to the beginnings of teaching. Amazing. Wonderful. Angel sent from heaven.
Norma is a great professor! She understands her students and takes the time to get to know you. The work is very easy and spaced out. She definately tells you what you need to know to be a teacher!
Norma inspires us all to be better PEOPLE, not just teachers. She is the ultimate role model.
Norma is absolutely, hands down the best professor of any professors of all time. Class was challenging yet informative and very relevant. She cares enough about each student to learn their names the first day of class. I will always think of Norma Bailey as my top role model, only second best to my own mother :)
Norma is amazing.  One of the best professors at Central.  I can't think of one bad thing to say about her.  She really cares about her students, their learning, and her classes.
The best professor I've ever had at CMU... a testament to what teachers and human beings should be! Kind, compassionate, fair... grounded in belief. My future students will be better off because I learned from her. My peers and I are so thankful for her. Cheers to Norma!
Absolutely amazing professor. She's so kind, listens to her students and is so understanding. As long as you go to class and do the work, you'll easily get an A. She just wants you to try and is not worried if you miss a couple classes or are late turning in a couple assignments. So passionate about education.
Norma has got to be one of the best professors at CMU. She is so much fun and so enthusiastic about education and young adolescents. I loved going to her class. She doesn't believe in strict grades, deadlines or exams. She makes her classes fun but you learn a LOT at the same time. I can't wait to have more classes with her.
Great teacher! Take her class if you think you want to be a teacher! It will make you truly choose!
Norma was my professor almost 10 years ago and I still remember how much she inspired me to be a middle school teacher.  She is such an incredible and fascinating woman and teacher.
Great professor and great course!
Norma is one of the nicest, most intelligent people that you will ever meet. Excellent teacher.
Norma is by far the best professor at Central. If you're interested in Middle Level education, go talk to her. She has such a ridiculous amount of knowledge on adolescents and wants to make you the best teacher possible. Also, if you want a classroom full of close friends, sign an MLE minor.
Most amazing prof at CMU. If you are going into education she will make you consider a minor in Middle Level. Very enthusiastic. Loves her job and students.
Norma is by far the best professor at Central. She definitly deserved professor of the year! She is very very passionate about what she teaches. She also will answer any questions you have, even if it has nothing to do with your class. I go to her with all my questions
Norma is by far the best professor I have ever had. The class is designed easy so that you can learn and reflect the most that you can. She will help you in any way and understands when things go wrong. She is the most inspirational person I have met at CMU. If you have a chance to take this class, you should! I promise you wont regret it at all.
Absolutely amazing.  Keep up the wonderful work, Norma.  I hope to do exactly what you do some day.
Teacher name: Kadyrova, Irina
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
It's a hard class but if you can focus for an hour every day then you'll be fine. You can't fall behind and you need to focus in class or you wont learn. Book is useful and online homework helps too
She's a challenging professor. I wish you luck.
If you've worked hard in previous math classes, congratulations because this class is 90% review. Kadyrova is useless, so I recommend asking your TA questions or forming a little group to work with. The graded homework will boost your grade, so try to rake in those hundos. Definitely do the test reviews and go to the review she has. You'll be fine.
Overall, I thought she was a good teacher. She gives you notes to print, which is really helpful and the recitation is also really helpful (if you have a good TA). She can be a bit intimidating and her accent can be hard to understand, but she really does want to help you learn the material and succeed.
Be prepared to do double the amount of work you expect out of this class. My biggest mistake was putting my trust in her for too long, and because of that I had to put hours into getting a decent grade. Her lectures and homework assignments are meaningless. Just read the study guides she sends out and you're set if you understand the concepts.
I get that its not easy teaching in a second language, but its not hard to teach efficiently in general. Shes not approachable, shes not friendly, shes rude to her students, and makes learning precalc 3x more complex than needed.
This professor was maybe the most boring teacher I have had. Her voice was very dull which made the lectures very difficult to get through. I would see a lot of students not show up and if they did they would usually leave half way through. I feel like the amount of homework was decent, but the homework was definitely more difficult than the tests.
You need 100% attentiveness to understand her accent. The language barrier is incredibly difficult to overcome. Luckily I already took pre-calc, so retaking this class was a breeze.
Awful language barrier. Tried taking this class twice and had to drop out because of her lack to communicate both times. I thought online would be easier so I could read what she was saying instead of having to listen and even that was rough. Horrible at doing problems, does not actually teach, and when she does she just does the problem w/out expl
Absolutely terrible. Made easy concepts way more difficult than they had to be, did every problem in an extremely complicated way that was in no way necessary. Stopped going to class because there was absolutely no point in going. She gets mad when you have questions and makes no effort to be understood with her incredibly thick accent.
Terrible teacher
She is the worst teacher ever. Nothing else needs to be said. There is literally no reason to go to lecture. If you do go you will want to tear your hair out. Good luck.
Makes mistakes on problems during lecture and online notes even her tests have mistakes.
Worst professor I have had and the tests are hard and makes everything way more difficult than it needs to be.
Lectures seem long and boring. The material she taught was not that difficult, but the way she taught it was not useful and often made an easy concept seem confusing.
Kadyrova was hard to understand in lecture and often times her lectures would be confusing and hard to follow. She often regraded tests because she was unhappy with the TA's grading and she would change grades on some tests and not others even though the answers were exactly the same on both of them.
Not a great professor. She gets mad if you ask questions and always makes mistakes when doing math.
Irina is hands down the worst math professor. My recitation TA even believes she should be fired, but the problem is she has tenure. Parts of this class are easy and some parts are difficult. The class should be an easy 4.0 if you do the extra credit and do decent on tests, but I would avoid this professor at all costs.
During lectures she doesn't explain the process of working out problems, she doesn't spend enough time on challenging concepts, and her expectations of what to know for tests are unclear. The content itself is not terrible, it is just the teaching style that could improve. Avoid this professor at all costs or prepare to teach yourself with youtube.
She is not a good teacher to begin with, she doesn't explain anything and then she has the thickest accent which doesn't help.
Teacher name: Pollock, Amy
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She is hands down one of the best professors that I ever had. The lectures were very easy to follow, but to understand the posted slides, you most often had to attend lecture. The exams tested your knowledge, but if you go and get outside help the exams are a piece of cake - and you can get extra credit. I would highly recommend her as a professor.
You need to attend lecture to understand anything, and then outside of lecture you need to look at the slides and make sure you understand what is going on. Study... a lot. The exams are nothing like what's done in lecture or recitation so make sure you look at the practice exams before hand and make sure you know how to do everything on them.
Good professor. Lectures are well prepared and executed.
Very active in class, allows questions and explains in strong detail, doesn't treat you like an idiot for the question, explains things in a way everyone can understand but not at a pre school level.
Once of the best professor's I've ever had. She is extremely competent and knows exactly what she is talking about. She explains things in a way so you actually understand and can connect different concepts, rather than struggling to simply memorize topics. She cares about her student. She is a powerful, intelligent woman, and a great teacher!
Pollack is hands down the best chem professor for CEM141 and 142. If you come to class, actually listen in lectures and do the practice exams to study, you WILL do well. She cares about her students and gives you pretty good hints at the exam review sessions about what will actually be tested. Great teacher!!
She dumbed things down in lecture, nothing seemed hard at all. All of the exams after exam 1 were very hard in my opinion compared to lectures and homework.
Great professor, all of CEM 141 classes are given the same exams so I would chose her to take the class with. Hard class, but I would pick this professor in order to do your best. She wants you to succeed and will help.
Did not care when I went to her struggling on over 3 different occasions. I went to her when my exam score was a 61% and she told me to go slower. I spent hours on end studying and her exams were stupid-ly hard. She wasn't willing to help me when I needed it the most. Didn't reply to my emails until the day of the exam. Terrible.
Lectures have a lot of information but she is a really good teacher and makes really good connections with other examples that aren't on the slides. Nothing on the exam that she didn't say in class. She knows what she's talking about, it's the class and it's concepts that's hard.
Her lectures are packed, but mostly even though she is a good teacher, she makes the subject that much harder, and furthermore is a very tough grader. Her exams are really hard, and if you skip class it's a sure fire 0.0 grade with her subject.
Dr. Pollock is a great professor and one of the best I've had at MSU. If you actually pay attention to the lectures then you will be fine. She makes chemistry easy to understand and a 4.0 is not very hard to get.
Gives a great understanding of chemistry with clear lectures. A 4.0 is very achievable if you put in the work. Clickers and homework are for participation, but you will not do well if you don't try in them (which doesn't take a lot of effort). Textbook is free, but I rarely used it.
Really good lecturer. Made the class interesting, and the material easier to understand.
Nice professor, impossible to learn from. I might be biased here, but 95% of the semester consisted of yes or no clicker questions, which doesn't help in teaching important/difficult content. I struggled on the tests despite the format (answer is either A, A B and D, C and B, D and A) which makes it so difficult when you're rushed for time.
I hate Chemistry but Professor Pollock was able to teach it in such an interesting way that I didn't hate going to the class. She was always super organized and always knew exactly how to get the correct answers from us. The homework went over what we covered in class and would take half an hour tops to complete. Plus it was participation based.
Nice lady, and a decent prof. She has her moments where she seems like a high school teacher, and doesn't want you on your phone or computer (even to take notes). Readings are assigned but you don't need to read. Good option to study for exams. Multiple choice questions are wordy and you can be right but you didn't put "the best answer".
This professor is honestly amazing. She teaches in a very effective way. As long as you pay attention, and take good notes, the class is not that hard.
She was very clear and easy to understand. She always encouraged questions.
This class is honestly one of the hardest I have ever taken. I attended every lecture and recitation, completed all the homework, and even went to the help room when I was confused. With that said, the exams were very difficult and I struggled on all of them. Amy is a good teacher and is very knowledgeable, the material is just very intense.
Teacher name: Hussain, Fayyaz
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
This is a lecture class, so he lectures the entire time which actually isn't terrible because he makes the lectures easy to follow and they aren't too terribly boring. Just make sure you go to class, take notes, and definitely listen carefully to his stories. As long as you're present and attentive for his classes you shouldn't have an issue.
Hussain thinks he is some type of messiah who is enlightening everyone in the class with stats and news that the average person already knew about years ago. He's also one of the most long winded professors I've ever had, and his lectures can get SO boring because he talks about the same points over and over again. This class needs to revamped asap
It is clear what his perspectives are on the political spectrum and he teaches based off fact and bias. It is hard to listen to a biased lecture for an hour and 20 minutes and not fact check everything he says. He gives very common knowledge and statistics and very rarely goes into interesting detail or unknown examples. Professor could learn more.
He is a great and funny professor but you have to go to class and actually pay attention because he gives out a good amount of quizzes and he also will have questions on his tests about the stories he tells in class. I did not buy the book or read because if you go to lecture you and pretty much already know/guess what the answer is.
Dont need the books at all, quizzes or attendance taken every class
Professor Hussain is not the nicest person, but the class was fine. I ended up with a 3.0 and did not mind going to the class. Attendance is mandatory. Quizzes are easy but tests are much harder. Had a 3.5 going into the final and ended up with a 3.0. Overall, not a bad class.
Seems strict at the beginning but is actually a pretty cool professor. Most of the questions are very straightforward and he gives you everything you need to know before the exam. The iClicker exams are almost every week but are very easy if you attend the lecture. If you pay attention in class and listen to his stories carefully it's an easy 4.0
He is very sarcastic and some may think he's rude, but he's just trying to help you succeed. you have to go to class to do good, but class isn't that bad. Also, he gives you exactly what you need to know before each exam. If you don't 4.0 this, then you must have just not listened. very good class
Prof Hussain is the classic stern lecturer that will tell you everything you need to know for the exams. He gives quizzes through an iclicker roughly every other day, however these are free points if you pay attention in class. The exams are online and super straightforward to what is discussed in class. Standard lecture class with a solid prof
Honestly you don't have to buy the textbooks he requires. I didn't and I'm ending with a 4.0 but I really wish I did the extra credit he offered in the beginning. His lectures sometimes are boring but everything you need for notes you can find on quizlet like I did. Best teacher ever I loved his class, if you have to take an ISS take this one!!
Long lectures... and make sure you remember the stories he tells. Most of the exam questions are taken from his stories.
You have to show up to pass his bi-weekly quizzes, BUT it is seriously so easy. He is the funniest and easiest professor ever. I would take any of his classes. Just don't fall asleep, or be caught on your phone or listening to music. His lectures are pretty boring but very straight forward. His exams are common sense.
Do the extra credit opportunity!! Make sure to do well on in-class quizzes. It'll save your grade!
This class can be an EASY 4.0 if you do the extra credit. It may seem like a lot of work, but it bumps your class GPA by 0.5 and helps your resume. The lectures are super boring and you dont have to pay attention for the most part. He will usually tell you if something is important. 50 multiple choice on three exams and he drops the lowest.
His lectures are long and can be somewhat boring, but he knows what he is talking about and makes the information fairly interesting. For the tests most of the questions from lecture are based off of examples he uses and not just from the slides. It isn't bad if you go to class and read the material.
Would not recommend one of his classes to anyone. Out of all the classes I have taken, he is by far the rudest and least caring to students. Students only have five seconds to answer iclicker questions, lectures are heavy, and Hussain goes out of his way to make this class very difficult.
Hussain can be extremely rude to students and is not afraid to call people out for sleeping or being on your phone. Overall, class isnt too terrible &amp; information can be interesting. Just BE PRESENT during lectures or he will call you out, &amp; NOT nicely.
His tests were ab it challenging but this class is worth the work. Very insightful.
SOOOO Boring and rude to students. Is not understanding at all.
I went to every lecture and read the assigned reading and barely 3.5. His lectures are long and boring. He is extremely rude to students and does not like answering questions. ISS should be an easy 4.0
Teacher name: Spranger, Marty
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Yes, Professor Spranger is very real guy! He can come off as hard head, but he teaches so that you actually learn the material. I have always struggled in school, but I put in the work for Spranger and I did just fine in his class.
Gives a lot of extra credit on random days but this class takes a lot of work to pass. He outlines exactly what to do to get a good grade and theres no way around it.
This was the hardest class I have ever taken, only because of Marty stranger. It has come to my attention that his name has actually become a laughing stock on campus due to his reputation of being so awful. Do not take his class.
Dr. Spranger may seem indimidating at first, but once you get to know him he is a very considerate person. His goal is to challange you to create a self sustaining drive towards academic excellence. Yes, the class covers A LOT of material, and can seem a bit overwhelming, but it is worth it in the long run.
Gives great lectures really cares about his students gives great advice about studying you learn a ton makes physiology super interesting only negative is the class is time demanding
Dr. Spranger genuinely cares about the success of his students. He frequently adjusts exam scores to account for questions missed by the majority and offers extra credit. There are attendance points and easy online homework which helps your grade. He will give hints about what class will have the tophat quiz so youre prepared He is very encouraging
Professor Spranger ensures that his students learn the material of the class. You may have to work a little harder in this class, but it is so rewarding by the end. USE HIS STUDY SKILLS TECHNIQUE! I lived by this in his class and 4.0. It is very possible and I use his study skills in my classes now.
Professor Sprnager has a reputation for being tough, however, he is extremely easy if you just follow his guide for passing the class. Some people say he is tough but thats only because he wants you to actually learn the material, not just memorize the words on a slide. If you put in the work, you will be rewarded!
Dr. Spranger is by far one of the best professors I have ever had and definitely one of my favorites. He gives you all of the tools and information that you need to do well in this class, you just have to put in the work. He truly cares about people succeeding and is always willing to help students understand the topics to do well in the class.
One of the most rewarding classes Ive taken! However, you will DEFINITELY have to work for it. Listen to the lecture recordings and take good notes on the slides. I learned more in this class than most classes but you will have to study a ton to do well.
Dr. Spranger's class is a tough class because he is giving out so much material. Unlike some professors that don't teach the material very well Dr. Spranger goes over all of the material you need to know for the exams its just up to you to go over it. He can seem intimidating at first but he has a big heart and genuinely cares about his students.
You will have to work hard for your grade, but it will be worth it. He makes sure you are actually learning, and not just going through the motions. He gives you all the tools and tips necessary to succeed, and if you take his advice, you will be successful. He is very willing to help you succeed if you ask. I now use his tips for all my classes.
Professor Spranger is very knowledgeable and he is a great lecturer. If you go to his class, you will really learn a lot in an hour and half. He is willing to help students outside the class as well. He is fair and caring for students. Put effort in, and you will get great grades!
Marty was one of the best professors I've had. Although the class may seem difficult at first, if you are willing to put in effort and try to learn the material you will see the results you want. He is fair when it comes to his tests and if you think that something was unfair he will give you the opportunity to overturn it. Great professor overall.
Professor Spranger was one of my favorite Professors at Michigan State University by far. He is an intellectual and is beyond knowledgeable when it comes to the fields that he teaches. He was more than happy to help me outside the class room during his office hours and provided many opportunities so students could do excel in the class.
Marty is a tough grader with tests that can be difficult, but for good reason. He wants his students to be successful in upper level biology classes. Anything worth doing takes effort. This class prepares you for ever other science class on campus. It will pay off
For an intro level course, goes way in depth. Spends about 4 lectures on one body system and then ends up falling behind and not covering lots of other body systems. Tests are insanely hard and averages were around the 60-70s, but gives extra credit sometimes. If possible, take with some other prof. This class will dominate your schedule.
Spranger is my favorite professor I've had in college. You have to take a lot of your time out of your semester to study for his exams but it's worth it. Make sure you follow his study skills videos. Office hours will definitely help and he has an awesome TA that takes a lot of his time to help students. He holds a lot of review sessions that help.
Professor Spranger is by far the best professor i've had. He puts in a lot of work to help students succeed. GO TO OFFICE HRS. Go to class for participation pnts and occasional quizzes. His exams are EXTREMELY hard. This class takes up your ENTIRE life. But material is super cool and you learn an insane amount of material. Favorite class i've taken
Terrible professor overall. Tests were very hard, he's very rude and he took pride on students receiving low grades. If you want to succeed, you will avoid his class at all costs.
Teacher name: Limbu, Marohang
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I loved this professor. If you ever get the opportunity to have him, take it! He's truly amazing and actually cares. When a student does bad, he is genuinely sad. He wants everyone to get an A, but also wants everyone to be the best writers they can be. I had a lot of reading for the class, but it was bearable and quick.
I hated writing but professor Limbu made me love coming to class. He is the nicest professor I have ever met and he really cares about how his students perform.
Loving and caring professor; recommend to take his class.
Professor Limbu cares his students. The best professor I have met in my life.
Amazing teacher
He's a very caring professor. He will work with you on your essays one on one and makes sure you get a 4.0.
Marohang is awesome!!!! Easy 4.0 and a great prof!!!
Great professor. Very helpful.
Very cool professor. I learned research and writing in this class plus leaned use of technologies, web design, prezi (so cool), writing strategies. This is a great class.
I learned alot. skills for writing, skills for using technology for my courses, skills for presentation. Also, this class gives you a positive attitude for living. you will conquer all the hardness.
Take his class, you never forget how cool this professor is. He really how to motivate students and teach them.
good professor and helpful class!
ive learned many things threw out this course like how to cite and quote. also how to corretly write and revise an essay in MLA form.
Professor Limbu is a great person loves to help the students you have to be really Stupid if you fail his class the work he provides is not even hard so by that being said i recommend you take his class.
Morhang is a great professor! I improved a lot in writing. I learned the proper way how to revise a paper, use correct in-text citation, Box quote, use prezi, how to use MLA format, and the proper way how to write a proper research paper. This class was very helpful!
Great guy. Hard to understand, but easy to communicate with. cares about students.
Marohang is totally a bro. We had a good time in class and my writing skills improved a lot. Just do what he says and don't slack off or skip class.
In this class I learned how to include all sides of the argument while writing research papers. I also learned how to take advantage of new presentation technologies such as prezi to captivate my audiences while presenting. Marohang is a great professor who makes sure the class learns the material but has a good time while doing it.
I learnt the american way of writing, and the way essays work in here. I learnt how to do the right format of citations.
Marohang is a good guy that is very interested in his students.  He wants his students to succeed in his class and makes all attempts to make sure they do.  There could be a little more group writing, but Limbu is always open for change so i wouldnt be surprised if he did more next semester.  Good Class, Great Prof.
Teacher name: Ballard, Charles
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Ballard makes EC 201 interesting and understandable. Be sure to show up to class and review all of the materials he gives you on D2L before exams and you will be fine.
Super nice guy and clearly passionate about what he teaches and his students. Lectures can be a little boring but occasionally he'll do something like sing to keep you interested. Tests aren't bad. He uses iclicker questions for attendance points, but it's only 5% of your grade. Book isn't necessary but did help some of my friends.
I love Professor Ballard! The sweetest guy and a good teacher. A lot of my friends did sort of poorly on their exams, but that was their fault. If you read the book, and actually do the problem sets you'll do well. AND TAKE THE PRACTICE EXAMS!! He reuses questions all the time!! You'll for sure 4.0 the class if you use the many resources he offers.
Dr. Ballard is an amazing Econ teacher and would highly recommend anyone taking his class. His class is actually interesting and if you go to class you wont need to study or anything as he teaches very well.
If you do the weekly problem sets, as well as attend class and take notes regularly you will do fine. He cares about everyone passing and actually learning. He takes a dry subject and turns it into something interesting during lecture. Go to the help room and office hours if needed, very helpful. Exams sometimes tricky, just study and get help.
He's really open to helping out his students and is just really nice. There are only three exams including the final, then weekly problem sets but you can find the answers online lol. The exams aren't super difficult and he posts a ton of practice exams with answers and explanations. If you study a decent amount you should do well!
Love this prof, funniest I've had so far
Very old school, funny guy. I am not a fan of economics, but Ballard makes it interesting. He doesn't post his content, so you have to go to class to get the notes.
Ballard is a great lecturer and you can tell he really loves what he does and cares about his students.  He makes a lot of "dad jokes" which can be either a plus or a minus.  The tests are fairly easy, providing you've paid attention to the material, and there aren't many surprises. I'd highly recommend him!
Professor Ballard was a great professor. He really knows his stuff and wants you to do well in the class. He makes sure you know what you're being tested on. He really cares about his students as well. Make sure to attend class as Econ is not an easy subject. He made me want to major in Economics!
Professor Ballard is brilliant and really knows his stuff.  Would highly recommend going to class because it is lecture heavy and he uses iclickers for participation points.  I would also recommend going to the Econ help rooms to do problem sets.  Super funny guy that really cares about his students.
Dr. Ballard really truly cares that you learn the material. He makes the lectures easy to sit through and understand, and he is genuinely a nice guy who cares about his students. I wish he could teach all of my classes as well as he teaches EC 201. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend him for EC 201. He says you will need the book, but I barely used it
he explains things really well and his lectures are interesting. It's an easy class as long as you go.
He is very passionate about Economics and the class is really easy if you go to class and take notes. If you take EC 201, I would definitely recommend you take the class with him.
My favorite professor so far.. Ballard has great enthusiasm for economics and also for his students success.  Exams are fair and if you take the practice exams and can do all those problems, you'll 4.0 the exam every time.  Would recommend!
Really good at explaining the content - easy to understand. He reads verbatim from his textbook (but better). You have two options:  1. Buy the textbook and don't go to class but study it religiously  2. Go to class and take notes (fast too) but no need for a text book. (Better option) Do his practice exams and look over your notes - easy A
Absolutely loved him as a professor. He loves to crack corny jokes and will sometimes sing in class. He truly cares about his students and wants them to do well in his class and often reminds his students of where to find help if it is needed. He makes the material easy to understand and hand writes all notes (no power points).
Dr. Ballard is an excellent economics professor.  He is extremely knowledgeable and can convey the information to students in a very effective way.  He is reasonable, passionate about economics and rather funny.  I enjoyed his lectures and the class as a whole and would recommend him very highly to anyone planning to take EC 201.
It is a great class! Ballard is EXCELLENT!
Course may be difficult, the class size is huge, but if you reach out, he will help.
Teacher name: Allen, Sue
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Get ready to teach yourself because she'll show easy examples of how to find the solutions but then the webwork will be completely different. Thank god the quizzes were easier.
If you took precalculus in high school, this class should be fairly easy. Quizzes every Friday, though, and a lot of Webwork. Webwork was probably the worst thing about this class honestly, exams were not too bad as long as you look over your notes. Class is not really that necessary, all of the notes are online.
Sue Allen is a great choice for a math teacher! I loved the was she taught and how she really cares if you do well in the class. She actually cares if you understand the material being taught. I highly recommend taking her class!
Lots of webwork and quizzes, tough grader when it comes to credit on those quizzes, but she does want you to succeed.
Lectures are hard to pay attention to. She skips over a majority of the notes and doesn't go into detail on what she does cover. Cares more about completing notes in time than if the class actually understands. WebWork is nothing like the content of the notes or the exams. If you don't do good on the exams you're screwed bc that's half your grade.
Professor Allen is AMAZING. She's such a sweet lady who is an amazing teacher!! She's always willing to help, and she explains everything thoroughly. She cracks jokes during class and as boring as math can be, her class is the opposite!
Really good teacher. I barely went to class and thats on me but you really dont need to. All of the notes are online and you can watch videos to understand things you didnt get from the notes. Good at office hours and very helpful. Super sweet lady.
One of best online professors I have ever had. Her lecture videos are very helpful. And the exam questions come from everything she teaches. if you are required to take MTH 103, I highly recommend you take her online summer class to get those credits out the way. I could go on and on explaining how great prof. Allen is but Im going to stop here :)
Math is hard! But prof Allen makes it easier to understand and takes it slow, it also helps that shes funny and relates the material to something interesting about MSU most of the time! Make sure you print out the notes and bring them to class, those are very helpful with the online homework and studying for quizzes and exams
Liked her abs a person and a prof, it felt like she really wanted everyone to succeed. The class wasnt very challenging but it was a lot of homework and quizzes all the time.
They drop the 2 lowest quiz grades and they're easy. Exams are NOTHING like the practice exams. Exams consist of random things and the WebWork is easily the worst part. You could study for hours and get 70's, which i guess is good since it was normal for people to get 30's. My TA was much more helpful and clear when explaining. Textbook isn't used
Got a 4.0 and never bought or used the textbook. Not hard stuff if you pay attention in lecture. WebWork was horrible though, worst part about the class.
She will not budge on final grade even if 0.1% away. Ruined my GPA
She's really sweet and helpful and has good pace during lectures.
This class is just super boring in general. Unless you live and breath math then you probably won't get a kick out of this one. Allen is nice nothing really negative to say about her.
She speeds through the lectures but is willing to stop and answer any questions. I like that she thoroughly explains subjects but as someone who naturally struggles with math I asked her a lot of questions after class and usually fell behind. The WebWork was due way too often and I always felt behind. I spent a lot of time in the MLC.
Sue is a really great teacher. Thorough, easy to understand, is willing to take questions, and wants you to do well. I strongly recommend her.
For this being my first college math class, Professor Allen did a great job of making the transition from high school math to college math as smooth as possible. The material is difficult at times, but her lectures are easy to follow and she teaches at a good pace. She is a sweet lady and makes math as enjoyable as it can be!
She was kind and joked in class but also got stuff done. She always explained the material very clearly. Overall enjoyed the class and loved Mrs. Allen.
sue allen is the best math professor that i have ever taken! she is so caring and will respond to any questions that you may have. although I'm not doing well in the class (I'm not good at math), she makes it easy to learn! i would take her again!
Teacher name: Stewart, Cy
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is an overall good professor, his morning classes were a bit brutal and boring. But he was very passionate in teaching, and provides some extra credit that helps a lot. Plus, he drops your lowest test score. Tests are very, very hard though all true or false.
For a 8 am class tries to keep it pretty interesting. VERY passionate about subject matter. Go to lectures because material not in books will be on the exams. Take notes, read the books, and save exams and you'll be fine. Seven Open Book/Open Note True-False exams &amp; no homework.
Cy is a good teacher his class isn't that hard if you go. You are allowed to use your notes and the books on the exams.  His class is not mandatory to attend but I recommend you do it makes it a lot easier to pass the exams, which are all true false including the final.
I love this class! I think he's a really good professor and he makes class interesting. Unlike many other professors, he relates class to the real world, which makes it easy to understand. Yes, the notes are a little difficult to understand and his test wording is complicated but if you go to class you should be fine.
Do not buy the book. It will be a waste of your money and reading does not help to understand the material. Make sure you go to class often because you will need the notes for the open exams. He is very boring, nice guy, but very boring. His topics are not that interesting either, unless you are really in to native Hawaiians.
The required textbook was edited by him and has several typos.  His lectures are loud and obnoxious. He's rude. The tests are all true/false, watch out for the wording.  While attendance is optional, he adds a lot of stuff in the lectures that you can't get from the book.  My advice, do not take a class with this prof.
He is a very funny teacher, which makes you want to come to class. His exams are hard to understand but they are all 25 questions true or false. The take home final is worth 100 points, if you get together with a group of people you can work on it together. The in class final is 75 questions true or false. 50 50!
do not take this class! the true and false questions are a paragraph long with words that incomprehensible. His notes don't make sense. It is impossible!
The teacher is all over the place in his lesson. He lost my final exam, would not accept responsibility for it and passed me only when i told him im going to the umbudsman to report him. Monotonous and droning, his students learn nothing and suffer for a semester in his class.
Good gosh. I have never had such an easy class. The tests are all true/false!! Honestly! How can you fail?? He gives you a take-home final for god's sake! If you don't understand him, I suggest expanding your vocab. He *does* use some higher level language, but no more than is expected of college students. Too bad he's retiring soon.
TESTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE...I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO TAKE THIS CLASS W/ THIS TEACHER!!!
Worst prof I've ever had. Just loves the sound of his crazy voice.
Go to class, read the books.  The final review is a lifesaver.  Do it FULL OUT.
This class isn't too bad, as long as you read the 2 books, and actually go to the class. He has some pretty cool stories, but you hear them over and over, as well as have to understand how they relate to what your doing on your own.
Tests are hard to understand.
He seems like a very nice guy, but he repeats all of his stories a million times. Plus, his stories never seem to relate to the topic. They are so long that by the time he is done, I cant remember what he was talking about. However I do have to say that the class is really not hard. If you read the book and come to class, you should have no problem
Really cool, but uses huge vocab
To everyone claiming that Cy is "soo hard" ...welcome to college. You cannot expect your professors to spoon-feed you answers to future exams in lectures, or be able to find those answers verbatim in your texts. Cy gives you the proper tools to make the larger inferences yourself. If you can't succeed at this, it's not him, it's YOU.
This class is hard, get out if u can. He is a nice guy but man are the tests hard. I would not recommend this class to anyone.
Nice guy.  Tests are hard even though you can use your notes, books and dicitonary!  When you read the books you think you understand until you take an exam.  He talks a lot to get his point across but I wish he would make his point and get on to the next topic before my attention is totally lost.
Teacher name: Obst, Norman
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He didn't do much teaching.
If you go to class, do the graded assignments, take the practice exams, you will get at least a 3 in this class. probably higher. Many of the students complain about the exam being hard, or how they were completely unprepared for it. They don't go to class, or read the slides. The slides have all the answers.
One of the best professors I had in my all higher education. Certainly on the very top at MSU Eli Broad Dept of Economics. He cultivated the desire to study economics in me which was later destroyed by some very poor professors in the very same department. I regard Prof Obst as an excellent economics and a wonderful mentor.
The tests are absolutely impossible and the grading system is ridiculous. This class works for those 3% of students who are actually interested in Econ. However, if you are like the other 97% who just need to get a pre-req out of the way, then prepare to struggle. Obst is an incredibly corny teacher. I personally was not a fan, whatsoever.
Lectures were fairly easy to follow, but the concepts were difficult to understand. Writing down all of the equations and vocabulary words helps. I recommend taking a lot of detailed notes. Exams didn't really follow lecture very well. Walked out of the final thinking I failed the class. Not sure how I got a 3.0.
Lectures online and lecture hours are for questions and going over HW problems. Exams are really hard but you get a page of notes with you on the exams. If you do the practice exams you're set, but they are hard. Weird grading, but if you 4.0 the final you 4.0 the class. You can take this class in a 17+ credit load (minimal to no work needed).
Do the problem sets and get a 4 point.  People make this class seem harder than it is.  He is always there to help you and tells you how to get a 4 point on his tests.
He doesn't go over Powerpoints in class and instead goes over random problems. The Powerpoints make little to no sense without a lecture with them. Despite this the tests are extremely hard. So if you want to struggle through teaching economics to yourself I would recommend a different professor
Rambling, uninformative lectures. Derogatory tone when talking to students. In his own world, should retire.
he posts everything online so his lectures are pointless. If you do choose to go you'll spend most of the class on twitter because he is boring and drones on. Also in the online practice stuff he posts a lot of his answers are wrong and don't match what the book says at all. If you respect your GPA at all, find a different prof
I barely went to lectures, since he posts them online. Everything you need (notes, hw, and more) is online. He also offers skype options for extra help, and he is a funny and nice guy. The exams are hard but just practice with the example tests and you should end up doing well!
He is the worst prof I have ever met. He is challenging in that he makes you teaching yourself without any help rather that the online materials. The lecture is 100% from the online materials so you don't have to go to lectures. The first week of the class he recommend to change your section, because you may fail this course with him :s !!
Hard class but if you work hard you will do fine. He encourages us to ask questions when we don't understand yet people don't and they get mad when they fail exams. I went to every class did what he said to do and I got a 4.0 and I wasn't the smartest back in high school. Work hard and you will do fine
There was a lot of online practice available to help master the material. Utilizing the online practice and activities helped my comprehension of the material, although I did not always get as good of grades as I expected. The grading was hard, but if you do the practice you'll be fine.
Alright let me tell you something, Professor Obst is a wonderful man. Very nice and helpful. I love school &amp; have always done well. But this class was hard, he was very boring &amp; dry. I recommend studying alot &amp; going to the help room if you have or will have him. But really try to do well on homework! If you like challenging class take this one.
Don't bother going to class, don't bother buying the book. Just look over the powerpoints online and do all the practice exams. If you do the practice exams and practice tests. You can't fail. You just have to teach yourself everything. You can use a page of notes on exams and two pages on the final so there should be no reason to fail. I got a 3.5
The negativity on here is bc he teaches 1000+ kids per semester and only the s**theads come on and complain. He gives you plenty of resources, online and off (help room/ skype hour/ email). You get to use a full sheet of paper on exams bc mainly you have to practice the concepts rather than memorize. Excellent professor if you apply yourself!
If you get Obst, don't bother going to class, just use the stuff he puts on Angel, he doesn't cover anything in class. I'm just glad I took AP Econ in high school so it wasn't all new. He honestly doesn't care if you fail, he tells you "If you do bad, it's your fault you didn't try hard enough" Try to get a different prof if possible
Obst was a funny old man but he was very challenging. I didn't think the class was as difficult as everyone is saying. If you watch all the lectures (he puts them online) you should be totally fine.
Not sure why all the negativity surrounding Obst on here. I thought the class was extremely easy and manageable. If there is anything that needs more explaining, the online notes are great. You are also allowed a note sheet for exams and two sheets for the final. Homework is easy as well. I would recommend having Obst.
Teacher name: Nichols, Hanni
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Hanni is a wonderful person and even better professor. She is clear about what you are required to know for tests, quizzes, and what is likely to be a common concept in future math courses. She's easy to access almost 24/7 outside of class, and has simple lectures that make even difficult concepts seem easy. She is the best math teacher I have had.
Hanni was an amazing prof! She really cares about her students and is extremely open and welcoming. Her lectures were always great and I always left class feeling extremely prepared and never confused.
Great prof
Probably the best instructor I have ever had in my life. Understanding of students' schedules and willing to make sure students understand material. Outstanding
It's impossible to dislike a class Hanni teaches. She is SO accessible outside of class. She is the sweetest, most caring teacher I've ever had. She is very flexible when it comes to making up tests/assignments (assuming you actually have a good reason to). She is so thorough when she teaches, too! Essentially, Hanni is an absolute gem.
Hanni is so chill. BEST teacher I have ever had. absolutely amazing. she is VERY good at explaining math skills, and is always willing to teach you 1 on 1 any time outside of lecture
BEST teacher ever she has office hours right after class, her practice exams r JUST like the real exam, and SUPER nice so she accompanies students (ex: did not hold class day before thanksgiving) would HIGHLY recommend getting and if u r good at math u prob dont even need to attend but I would recommend it
THE BEST PROFESSOR AT MSU! She makes everything understandable and easy to grasp. I have never taken a Calculus class before taking this class. I felt super prepared for exams because she is super helpful and is really good at explaining concepts (even if you've never seen the content before). She genuinely wants her students to be successful.
Where do I even start?!?!? Hanni is the best prof to ever step foot on the MSU campus! She is always willing to answer any questions, and she is super accessible. She stays up pretty late so when your late night studying she is almost always available. She also has a passion for math which makes it a whole lot easier to understand. TAKE HANNI!!!!
TAKE HER CLASS
She is VERY nice. Her lectures are easy to understand because she simplifies the material. If you want a more theory-driven/rigorous approach to Calculus, read the online textbook as well. I wish that she explained some of the why's of calculus since it would make the material more intuitive. Her exams are really easy and lenient!
She's the best
Hanni is by far the best professor I have ever had. She is a night owl and so she stays up super late into the night and will answer your questions without hesitation. 100% will be trying to get her for my other math classes.
Hanni is really sweet, you can ask for almost anything and she will not get mad at you (I emailed her the night before an exam to move my test time and she let me do so, though I do not recommend trying this). If you have to take a calculus of any kind, she's great at having tons of office hours and always takes questions in lecture.
Hanni is such a beautiful and wonderful human being. She works really hard to make sure that ALL of her students understand the material. Math 103 is only difficult once you get to the end of the semester because who likes rational functions? However, Hanni has done an AMAZING job helping me understand them. Highly recommend her, she's a gem. &lt;3
Great teacher, she tops any prof I've ever had. She taught me calc 2 so well that I plan to LA for this course next semester. She's basically the cat lady mom that's amazing at math that you've never had.
Cares about her students passing and doing well, its really easy to pass but only if you do your work.
Going to class and doing your online work is really all that matters to get you good grades.
Really easy class! She makes everything super clear and takes her time going over concepts. Great professor and would definitely take her again!
Best professor ever! I have her class along with the online course and I don't think I would be able to pass with out her! She's very detailed in what you need to know for tests, quizes, everything! You can tell she cares about her students and wether they fail or pass.
Teacher name: Laduca, Robert
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
worst teacher ever
dont take tis class
Laduca is the man. You wont regret taking him!
Laduca is a VERY funny prof and loves to make jokes during his lectures. Sometimes he can get carried away and it can be distracting from the material. But overall I love his class and he has made CEM 142 very fun! Class isn't too bad, if you study and pay attention in class a 4.0 is achievable! I would definitely take one of his classes again.
This prof ruined my love for chemistry and my GPA. I did everything I was supposed to do- I did ALL the reading and then some, went to office hours frequently, and took so many notes during lecture, and still didn't get above a C on a single exam.
Lectures move very quickly, be prepared to see something once and then be expected to know it for the exam. Dr. LaDuca is incredible knowledgeable, but I felt that he sometimes forgot concepts were not always as clear to the class as they maybe were in his mind. Likes to make a lot of jokes, you will see many chemistry memes in lecture.
Don't mess around on mastering chem because that is weighted the same as your tests because it is a point based system, Laduca's tests are harder than the other teachers but he is a better teacher and he makes class interesting.
Professor is great but the actual class is complete cancer.
I loved taking Chem with LaDuca. His enthusiasm truly makes the complex subject more enjoyable to explore. He's a pretty funny guy and incorporates memes into his lectures. I love how willing he is to have students engage - he frequently asks iClicker questions to test your absorbed knowledge and thoroughly explains answers. He's willing to help!
LaDuca prepares freshman for their futures in whatever field they choose to go into. He expects a lot, but if you focus in class and go to office hours, he is really down to earth and explains things well. Make sure you really understand concepts very well. I didn't do great on his tests b/c he designs them to be tough, but they are not impossible.
I love Dr. Laduca. I cannot stress enough how much I hated Chemistry before I took his class and while i'm in his class now, he has made it so fun and interesting and easy to understand. He is such a smart guy and really cares for his students. 10/10 recommend .
Dr. LaDuca is the best prof I have had at MSU. He is super knowledgeable about chemistry, and he's also absolutely hilarious. He knows how to interest you in chemistry. The class is very difficult, so if you do the online homework and go to lecture and recitation regularly, you'll be fine. I would definitely take another class with Dr. LaDuca!
Laduca is a good professor IF you can learn the way he teaches. His teaching style didn't work well for me and I really struggled to understand the material. I went to office hours once and he was absolutely no help what so ever, so I didn't go back. LA's are your best bet if you don't learn from his teaching.
Dr. Laduca is an amazing professor to have for chem in LB. He's hilarious and has made me love coming to class. Time in class flies by because he keeps students interested. Plus, he's very knowledgeable about Chemistry and helps you learn a lot.
The meme king was truly phenomenal. He's incredibly intelligent; he makes his lectures engaging and interesting, as well as adding in hilarious memes and "Fail Fridays." This class is difficult, so if you attend class and work hard, you'll definitely pass.
He is hands down the best prof I've had so far at MSU. In general, LB 172 is a hard class but he is definitely the best prof to teach it.
LaDuca is such a great prof; hes a genius when it comes to chem but he really knows how to bring it down to a level where students can understand. He's hilarious and loves to meme EVERYTHING. It's a tough course but it's college. Take the course with him if you can or regret missing his daily jokes and friday fails!
He was fantastic, inspirational. Made me enjoy chemistry, rather thand read it. No, you can't scoot by just by showing up, you do have to work. But he helps every step of the way!
Dr. LaDuca is totally relatable. He is by far my favorite professor at MSU, even though I've only been here for a semester.
LaDuca is amazing! I got a 3.5 in the class and I owe a lot of that to him. He understands the material well, but teaches it even better! You won't be disappointed with him! I promise! He truly cares--wants to help you and is by far one of the funniest men I've met. For sure my favorite professor at Michigan State yet.
Teacher name: Broman, Cliff
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Pros: extra credit, not a lot of homework Cons: exams are EXTREMELY difficult, you have to read all three books or you will not pass, takes forever to put grades in, a lot of group work, and makes you do "peer grading" This class is not an easy A, if you do not show up to class, or do the readings you will not pass.
generally, a nice guy. he takes his work very seriously, and assigns A LOT of readings. he does offer a lot of extra credit, but you can't rely on this for your grade. exams and quizzes are extremely long and difficult with a lot of essay and fill in the blanks. if you dont do the readings, you WILL fail
He makes you work hard. You have to read at least six hours a week. You have an exam every few weeks. If you come to class, you'll pass. Tests are 50% of the reading. You get extra credit if you don't complain and come to class. His lectures are very interesting. I have never learned more from a class!
DO NOT TAKE CLASS, one of those professors that research so they need to teach a class as a requirement (aka not qualified). Gives a ton of extra credit to make up for bad grades but not enough to pass with more than a 2.5/3.0. Attendance taken on random class days and content taught in class is irrelevant to whats tested. TAKE ANY OTHER CLASS
Broman will tell you on the first day that this class will be a lot of work (especially the crazy amount of reading) and that by the middle of the semester you may hate him (I did) but you will definitely learn. If you have the option to avoid him as professor, TAKE IT. If you can't, just search for ISS335 on quizlet and pray for the best.
Very disappointing. Interesting general context but focuses entirely too much on arcane details from the 300+ pages of reading.
Heavy readings required in order to pass the class, which sometimes involves very irrelevant content. Tests are difficult &amp; based on irrelevant content such as data and tables that are good to know but are not essential for the class. Finally, there is a lot of content that students are required to memorize to the point where it becomes impossible.
Dr. Broman is a smart guy, but he makes this class so difficult. If you don't read every page assigned, there is no way that you'll pass.
He is a nice guy but his exams are impossible. He wants you to read VERY long chapters and tests you on small, insignificant details from them that are impossible to recall. He gives out a lot of extra credit, which is the only reason a decent grade was somewhat obtainable for me.
Ah, Broman... Infamous and he knows it. Literally does not care either. I didn't mind sitting through lectures, but he doesn't give enough information for you to study for his ridiculously hard exams. He tells you to memorize statistics, but doesn't tell you which ones. He tests heavy on textbook reading and doesn't post grades.
Broman seems to put his feelings and opinions over those of the students. His tests barely cover the 300+ pages of reading, and when students are upset with the results (first exam average was a 54) he ignores our concerns and just throws extra credit our way to make up for it. This class was far harder than it should have been due to him.
He seems right away that his class will be awful, but slowly removes assignments and makes the work more manageable. There is a group presentation but it isn't so bad. Very hard exams based on textbook readings but he gives TONS of extra credit to make up for it.
Broman's class is ludicrously difficult. More time is spent reading the 3 books he assigns and studying for his extremely difficult exams than my other 4 classes put together. Avoid him at all costs. The only positive of him is he provides mass amounts of EC. He claims only 10-15% of students achieve an A.
I am pursuing a business degree here at MSU. I was put into this class by my advisor just to fit my schedule. Please do not take this class if you do not have to, I'm serious. This man makes you read so many pages of his 3 books that are required... the tests are absolutely brutal there is no other way to describe them. stay away...
I DO NOT recommend this professor. The amount of reading he assigns will take up most of your time so be ready to really read. During class the lectures are jam packed with information you need to know and he goes through it pretty fast so note taking is hard. The stress from this class is not worth it, find something else if you can!
His tests are impossible to do well on. He assigns 300+ pages to read before an exam. Then when you are taking the exam you realize a lot of the material 1) wasnt in the reading 2) not talked about in class. So where is are we supposed to get this information. Would not recommend.
Broman is a great guy but unfortunately not as great of a prof. He gives elaborate, real-world examples to explain his ridiculously-long PowerPoints. He offers plenty of extra credit to those who frequently attend class and complete certain worksheets. The pop quizzes are awful. The WORST part of soc is the exams- so hard and never what you study.
Hardest class I have ever taken. Never doing that same mistake again. Dropped my overall GPA from a 2.8 to 2.1.  Would not recommend.
This is not a blow off class. However, if you're mentally present, it will completely change your outlook on life in general. he packs so much information into this class, but it is all so important. one of the most beneficial classes I took in my college career.
Told us we have a quiz just two days in advance, and the quiz ended up being over 250 pages of textbook material, and was a 60 question true/false quiz. Very frustrating class.
Teacher name: Powers, Jennifer
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She's alright but she should really get some new pens. Her handwriting isn't the best and she uses markers to write which just makes it worse to read through the projector. Is always shushing the class even when no one is talking. Always starts class a minute before class time. Isn't the greatest but I just needed to get a good grade and I did.
Hand writing is horrible- can't read it. Goes very fast. Ended up with a 3.0. She is an average professor.
goes fast on notes &amp; will get through at least 3 or 4 lessons done in lecture, doesnt stop for questions &amp; handwriting is pretty hard to read, so if you go to lectures you have to actually listen to what she says. webwork &amp; quizzes are super easy &amp; your best bet is to stud at least two days before an exam
Lol, terrible teacher.
Powers is an alright teacher, but Math 103 is an awful class. Who thought it'd be a good idea to throw kids who failed the placement exam in a lecture hall where you can't ask questions? Powers goes through notes extremely fast &amp; doesn't care if you understand the material. The quizzes and webwork aren't too bad, but the exams are MUCH harder.
Professor Powers was a good math teacher! You should go to class, because her lectures are pretty dense and she goes through the material very quickly. The first two tests of the semester were the hardest and the last two were the easiest. The homework is tough and WebWork based. She usually assigns one set of 10 homework problems every week.
She's really nice and caring, and even brought us candy before exam week. Even though she goes pretty fast, her lectures are okay and easy to understand. You're given lots of recommended problems to do in the book and actually doing them will help you understand the material on the tests which aren't too hard if you pay attention and go to lecture.
She's a great professor, gets things taught efficiently. She refers to the class as "boys and girls" but not really in a condescending way. You'll have a TA to teach your recitation and grade your tests and quizzes. Powers makes some quiet jokes and plays them off, that's really funny if you pay attention.
Granted I'm not the best math student to begin with, but this class wasn't easy. If math isn't your strength be prepared to work hard in this class to get above a 3.0/3.5. Powers isn't very approachable and isn't enthusiastic about answering your questions. She comes to lecture, dictates the notes, and thats that. You'll have to work hard for a 3.5
She explains things pretty throughly most of the time, but sometimes she goes super fast and then super slow. She is really moody and you never know how she will act. She has yelled at kids for asking questions and is constantly saying "be quiet" when the classroom is silent. Overall a pretty easy class, but she isn't the best.
Explains things in detail
She's overall a really good and in-depth professor. She really assists and go over material with you if you are having trouble with it. Exams are pretty much similar to what you've learned in class, just attend the class and you'll be good.
I'm not a fan of math by any means, but with the right teacher you can do very well. Professor Powers is a good teacher, but I didn't hardly show up to lecture, so I did pretty poorly in her class. Not a good idea to skip, otherwise you'll be scrambling as I did. Great professor, though she is slightly belittling.
Great teacher, she'll go through an specific topic and explain it thoroughly. She'll joke sometimes and try to make math a little less tedious. Overall, she made math interesting and fun.
Attendance isn't mandatory for lecture, but is for recitation. Being a math class, lectures are extremely important. Lessons are put up online and you should print them out before the lecture. You take notes the whole time and she makes the work pretty clear. Easy to 4.0 if you put forth the work. Do the homework problems before quizzes &amp; exams.
Lost of people are quick to judge due to her niceness. If you attend to class and pay attention you'll get an easy A. She's pretty funny and tries to have a stress free class.
The class is hard (coming from a non-math person), 5 credits, 5 days a week. But, Powers is great. She is very clear, makes the best of the huge lecture situation, and obviously cares about her students doing well. She understands math is not easy for everyone and would explain every step of of every problem -  no one was ever confused due to her.
While Mrs. Powers is very good at explaining math, she treats students like they are little kids.  She regularly calls students "boys and girls".  She also tends to baby-talk and she doesn't use the correct terminology all the time.  Exams are a lot harder than the quizzes but there are a lot of help rooms available!
Her lectures were really good, she was very clear and knew how to explain the material. If you listen close enough you will catch an unexpected joke, which always gave me a good laugh. I dont recommend that you ask questions during the lecture though, I have seen her lite a couple kids on fire. But overall really a nice teacher.
Mrs. Powers is a fantastic teacher, this is coming from someone who HATES math with a burning passion. She made it much easier to understand and he explanations are always very clear. She loves what she does and I think that translates into what she brings to class. :)

This is by the far the worst teacher on the planet...you can hardly understand anything she says. She makes a somewhat interesting course, DULL &amp; BORING. There is absolutely no point in going to lecture because she takes it DIRECTLY from the book...so just read the book. She will not keep you updated on your grade throughout the entire semester.
Personally, I felt like she made a class that had the potential to be really interesting, incredibly irritating. She takes everything from lectures directly from the book so you don't even need to go to class. It makes it worse that she is REALLY biased about everything she talks about instead of keeping an open mind, which I find very frustrating.
The tests are hard to understand because they're not exactly written in regular English, which ended up hurting my grade.  It's an easy class with not much work, and the professor is very passionate (maybe even too passionate) about what she lectures on.
TERRIBLE. she makes me not wanna come to her class ever. usually i dont, just to protect my mind. horrible teaching skills and almost completely impossible to understand. STAY FAR AWAY.
The course material might have been interesting, but it was guided on statistics pulled directly from the book. Though a nice woman, I felt that a huge burden was put onto the TA. The grammar on the tests was sometimes so jumbled that it was impossible to know what the question was even asking.
Her class is so easy, but don't expect to learn anything. She would assign us to read wikipedia pages for homework and have Pakistani fashion shows... regularly. Again, the class was a breeze, but she's awful.
I actually thought she was kind of fun, mainly because of her accent and because she loved it when people debated in her class. Also, it was really easy. I rarely went to class on tuesdays (exams and stuff were on thursdays) and still got a 3.5 with almost no studying. Really not that bad for a required ISS class.
Probably the worst professor at MSU.. Avoid her!!!
Years later, this woman is my prime example of professors who force you to memorize nonsense to pass the class, and therefore sacrifice your true understanding of the bigger picture. She cares more about useless statistics than she does about concepts one could use in other classes or reality.
DO NOT EVER TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES. SHE IS HORRIBLE. All we ever talked about was Muslims, Arabs, and Islams. It was an intro to Sociology course. Also, she doesn't put any grades on Angel. It's been a week since I took my final and still haven't received my score back yet. I got my scores from my exam I took yesterday already. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
Worst professor I've had while at Michigan State.  She could care less about students, rarely taught unless it was reading definitions directly off her powerpoint, and made a sociology class into a lesson on how all of the white Americans are ruining Muslims' lives.  One upside is that it was an easy class.  Stay away at all costs.
Longest exams ever, and only gives you a limited amount of time which is less than your normal class.  Doesn't know what a valid excuse is for being in the hospital.  Will not post notes to Angel,isn't helpful to any concerns students have. Can't understand her English.
Do not take any of her classes if you can help it.  She is a horrible teacher, doesn't know her own slideshows, and has very poor grammar.  She will often read right from the book-- I can do that at home.  She is also very difficult to understand.  Don't bother going to class, because the tests are completely out of the book.
I came into this class with an open mind, and came out of it pissed off. Not only is she rude, but her tests are ridiculous. She has you read roughly 300 pages per exam just to ask you dates and percentages. She's a pathetic excuse for a teacher (considering she doesn't teach) and i would never recommend this class if you value your sanity.
Seemed culturally knowledgeable at first, later it really _seemed_ like her only interest was preventing overprivileged white people from passing. Asked specific details about population % during specific time periods; ignore her lectures and surf the web. Moved students around (a lot) during exams, which was incredibly distracting and destructive.
hard to understand, shows notes too fast. make sure you read the book! on exams she ask too specific of questions, kinda impossible
This woman complains about how she has been discriminated against for being an Arab Muslim but practices her own form of discrimination. Should you take her class(es), be prepared to bombarded with Islam and nothing else. People outside our class constantly asked with confused faces if it was a religions class, but we only discussed Islam.
I was very pleased with this professor, she is a smart woman and has a lot of life experience to back up her information.  Unfortunately, I noticed that students were somewhat obnoxious in her class, and I think it was for discriminatory reasons or simply their lack of understanding a different culture.  I highly recommend her... if you want to lea
There's no REAL reason to go to this class. She reads from the book - or Wikipedia - every day. She told us videos wouldn't be on exams. Two weeks before the final, she told us they would. She refused to meet anyone about them during office hours or give the names of them. 
 
 Take a class taught by someone interested in helping students learn.
This class was HORRIBLE!!! I thought it sounded interesting, but it was boring, and I didn't learn a thing! The tests were ridiculously hard, and the items on the test were not of importance. It seemed like she was just trying to stump us instead of helping us learn. I hated this class, I hope nobody ever takes it again.

Great teacher
One of the best professors i have ever had. you have to put in a  lot of effort for this class, but it is worth it. Very entertaining man. You can tell he wants his students to do well
By FAR the absolute WORST professor I have ever had. Terrible teacher, does not explain any course material. You basically must learn everything yourself. If I wanted to teach myself Accounting, I would not have paid a Big10 University to have some monkey scribble gibberish on a projector and tell me to learn the material on my own.
Organized, professional, smart, prepared.  He tells you exactly what you need to do to 4.0, and its a lot of work for a sophomore, but you learn a lot and learn how to study for accounting classes.  My favorite professor.
Dr. B is the best professor I've had at Michigan State. I can definitely say that I have learned more in his class than any other class I've taken and since his course I have decided to pursue Accounting. He likes to put tricky questions on exams, but always read them 2-3 times and make sure you get every last detail!
Difficult course. Great professor and if you work at it, you can earn a good grade. His quiz and test questions are tricky, watch for the wording on them and you'll be fine. Also, the questions contain many parts. Overall, great teacher, quizzes and exams are curved so the course is fair.
You learn more in this class than any other pre-core business class. Exams and quizzes are difficult, but very doable if you actually study and put forth the amount of effort that Dr. B advises. He sets you up to succeed, but your success is completely up to you! Definitely the best class I've taken at MSU so far.
Dr B is the man. Enough said.
He really cared about the class and that everyone learned accounting.
The hardest class I've ever taken at MSU. You have to teach yourself 100% of the material. The class is 50 minutes and he says you can't ask questions because there is no time. If you don't have to take this for your major, DO NOT TAKE IT. Very very difficult
MSU has a top-10 accounting degree program in the nation, that being said, his grading system is competitive and you can easily end up hating the class if you're not earning a good grade. He is helpful though and even though the failure rate of the class is high, he is hands down one of MSUs best professors.
Great professor, anyone who gives a bad rating was just too lazy to seek out extra help or was just dissatisfied with their grade in the class. He worked through problems at a good pace and his lectures were very coherent and clear.
Very enthusiastic about his class.  One of the best teachers.
He is a very knowledgable professor. His class is very difficult though, 2nd highest failure rate at MSU I believe. His tests are difficult and he makes them tricky but there are a ton of resources (help room, office hours, homework, etc..) If you plan on taking him and his class be prepared to devote your life to accounting for the next few months
Dr. B is a boss. This class was pretty difficult for me. However I think it's mostly due to me not taking advantage of the book, help room etc. Dr. B is extremely passionate toward accounting and MSU. His goal is for you to actually learn not just go through the cycle and get a 4.0. Hard class, but easy if you take advantage of the things he offers
This class literally has one of the highest failure rates in the country. However, this is by far one of the best professors at Michigan State. He knows his stuff inside and out, and as long as you put in a lot of work you'll do fine. He is very clear about what you need to have done and about his policies. You will know this stuff by the end.
Professor B, is very passionate about accounting. And is completely if not overly fair when it comes to grading. Accounting with him, is what you put in you'll get out. He has tons of help room hours. You have a group project, and all exams are curved. You have to put your butt, and STUDY STUDY STUDY to pass with a good grade. READ THE BOOK AND CP!
Hands down one of THE BEST professors at MSU. He has a skewed rating because he is teaching quite a hard class. I honestly loved him, and i know a lot of people who did bad in the class, but would have failed after a month if it weren't for him.
He's a really fun prof, my class actually cheered for him after the last class. His class is not easy, though.
If you're an accounting major, you'll have fun. If you're required to take it and have no previous accounting knowledge (like me) you're screwed even if you study. Worst grade I've ever gotten at MSU (2.0).  So difficult! He knows HIS stuff, but teaches it very poorly. Hated this class and this prof was no help.

Teacher comments: 
I am shocked by how many people show up unprepared for this class. The presentations are atrocious. If you take this class seriously, you're bound to be a top candidate for jobs. Great opportunity to hone your speaking and writing skills. The class isn't a blow off, but it's not hard.
This class is a lot of work - but it's not busy work. I really like Professor Wisner and my TA. I'm already using what we're learning in my interviews.
This is the best required class at Broad.
She has a heart and soul. She obviously cares about students. Its refreshing.
Great prof. I liked the class.
This class is a lot of work. Grading is brutal at times but as much as I hate to say it, I'm glad it was. My writing sucked and I didn't even realize how unprepared I was for interviewing or presenting. Find someone who is organized an good at keeping track of assignment deadlines. Become friends with that person. There is so much to keep track of.
I don't like doing speeches or writing papers and this class has a lot of both. When I saw the syllabus I expected to hate it. But Professor Wisner made it not suck. She is enthusiastic and explains why this stuff matters. I'm still never going to love speeches or papers but I got better in this class. Show up and do Top Hat to 4.0 class.
So glad this class was required because I never would have taken it. I learned something new each week. Got pushed out of my comfort zone which was hard but good. Great feedback on assignments. The professor really cares about students. I was lucky to have her as my recitation instructor too. At first I was nervous about that but she is awesome.
Its nice to have a professor who cares. Lots of work, but its not busy work. The TAs give good feedback, especially on the writing assignments.
Very beneficial class. Meet the professor. She is funny and nice. oh, and she loves her baby and dogs. Shell show you pics if you ask :) She helped me make some hard decisions about internships and my major.
I found this class to be pretty straightforward. If you show up and do the work, you can get a good grade. Plus, the Wisdom Project is awesome if you get paired with someone good. The blog post at the end is not an easy A. Ask your TA for help.
Thanks to this class I got an internship. Had no idea how bad my cover letter and interviewing was before. Take it soph year.
Expects a lot, so be prepared to work. The class isn't a bunch of mindless crap that you can just memorize... which is probably why people complain about it being hard. You actually have to learn something. Crazy, right? We'd all be better off if more teachers were like her. Was glad for the extra credit because I blew off the 1st book chapter.
Learned more in this class than any of my other classes so far at msu
The grading is so ridiculous in this class that they need to handout around 25 points of extra credit (roughly +5% to your total grade) just so students can get a chance to 4.0 the class. The rubric is unclear on every single assignment so be prepared to do badly on almost every assignment but still somehow get a 4.0 in the end
Lots of work, but you get a ton of time in recitation to work on stuff. Learned something new each week. Much better than I expected.
Great class, great prof. I learned a lot more than I thought I would. Lots of work but definitely worth it.
If you show up to all of the classes and follow instructions for assignments. You will 4.0. There's also a lot of extra credit opportunities throughout the semester.
I like her enthusiasm. Her lectures keep me awake. Easy 4.0 if you put in the effort. She expects a lot... don't expect a blow off class.
The best thing about the professor is that she really cares about her students. I took the time to meet with her to discuss my career interests. She gave me so much great insight and took a lot of time out her really busy schedule to answer my questions. Take the time to meet her. She's not just another professor cashing a paycheck.

Teacher comments: 
I got a 2.0 in this class but he was the easiest of the 101 professors from what I heard. He's a funny guy, and if you show up everything in lecture is from the book and you should do way better than I did.
I loved taking Psych with Hambrick. Very genuine guy who truly enjoys teaching. His lectures are enjoyable and he provides excellent media / real-life examples for specific terms. The tests cover exactly what is referenced in PowerPoints and sometimes the textbook as well, but they are very easy if you put in study time.
Hambrick was awesome for psych. I would suggest going to class and listening to the lectures and stories he tells, but if you are someone that can teach yourself the material, then he does post all of his powerpoints the week before each exam. You have to participate in a few hours of research studies but you can get EC from them if you do extra!
He's a great guy and wants you do well in the class. It's an easy A as long as you review the notes
Heres the whole class in a nutshell.... u dont need to go because he teaches from a powerpoint which he gives you 1 week before the tests. The class is an easy 4 because literally every test question comes from the powerpoints. With that being said the powerpoints are long so lots of memorizing,
Long lectures
Amazing teacher and a great person to get to know. Highly recommend him because he truly loves his job and he offers you 3% extra credit if you an extra 6 hours of research. He is really funny and a down to earth guy who really, really, loves dogs.
I went to every class, put in numerous hours of studying, and even attended his office hours multiple times, yet I still ended up with a C in the class. Got a 95 on the final and was a point away from a higher grade but he would not change it. His class solely is based off 4 exams and a few hours in research labs.
The class is just exam grades which can be difficult, but if you pay attention to the lectures, take good notes, and make sure you study at least a bit you'll be okay.  Hambrick gives interesting lectures and he kind of sounds like Bill Clinton which is a plus.  I really enjoyed the class!
Very charming and funny individual. Lectures were given with care and charisma. Tests only. No homework. No "mandatory" reading but I recommend you do the reading if you want a good grade.
A great teacher and made me excited to go to every class. I would love to take one of his courses again or shadow him in his work.
cool guy
best professor at msu
Such a great professor! Goes over everything in detail and as long as you review all of the terms, you'll do fine on the tests. He's hilarious and a really nice guy.
As long as you go to lecture, you shouldn't have to do much reading outside of class besides the 2-3 pages he tells you to read before an exam. Lectures are very information heavy and provide a lot of examples that are extremely helpful. Also funny and entertaining which makes lectures go by faster. Grade is all exams with the exception of 3%
Really great teacher, makes sure you know the material and makes the lectures interesting.
Very long lectures, but you get one break, and sometimes he'll even let the class go early. Very nice and funny professor.
Hambrick is extremely helpful and funny. He makes the class interesting, even though it's very long. He wants students to do well. I would recommend taking the class with him if possible.
Goes over everything you need and reiterates material from book so you don't have to read it. Doesn't drone on and makes sure you have access to materials before tests.
He was a cool teacher. For me, it was an easy A, even though I skipped class a lot and barely studied. I do not recommend skipping class if you are not a naturally smart person! He explains the material great, and he is easy to listen to. Do what you need to do to get that A and you will be fine. Good luck!!

Teacher comments: 
Best professor I have ever had. I cannot stress enough how amazing his lectures are, and he really cares to teach his students/ make sure they succeed. 1000% sure you should take him for any psych class he offers. A great professor but also a great human being in general.
By far the best professor I've ever had. He relates the class to his personal life to make the course material easy to understand. There are clicker quizzes everyday but half the time he will give you the answers to them and the other times the questions are common sense based on lecture. Also gives extra credit. Best PSY101 prof from many sources.
Professor Weaver is amazing! Really wants you to pass, works with you and gives plenty of room for extra credit. There was a group project this year that added about 25-30 points of extra credit (Easy A) but the exams were pretty tough. If you miss a lecture (there's attendance) then it's hard to understand the material. Take him if you get to!
Very enthusiastic during class. Encourages discussion and questions by giving poker chips for extra credit. This is the first semester where he's given group projects so they might change, but mine were easy. They added up to 30% of the grade but were quick and painless
AMAZING. He cares about his students a lot, his lectures are hilarious, and is down to the point on the content. There are clicker questions so don't plan on skipping. Exams are real-world situations, so make sure you spend your time applying the material. Practice exams are very useful, so use them. If my major req'd more PSY classes, I'd pick him
I love this professor! He's the reason I changed my major to Neuroscience--because I wanted to take more psychology! His grading is a little tough, with exams being worth the majority of your grade. However, if you pay attention to lectures and write down clicker questions, you should do fine! I really enjoyed this professor.
Print out the lecture slides and take notes on those. Everything you need to know is in them except for the occasional thing he asks you to look up in the book which there were probably only 3 of when I took it. He makes the class enjoyable even though it's long.
One of my favorite professors, he is a great lecturer, so funny, and teaches a great and interesting class. There are pop quizzes which can be tricky, but the exams are easy if you study. Textbook is not necessary, the class notes are very comprehensive. No mandatory attendance. Fairly easy papers. Extra credit available. Amazing class and teacher!
Dr. Weaver is an amazing lecturer, but his tests are very hard. Your whole grade is based off of 7 pop quizzes and 3 exams, and as a bad test taker, this has been hard for me. But he's a great guy and I would recommend his courses if you don't struggle with tests.
A funny and cool professor. He gives clicker questions but drops a reasonable amount of them as well as other assignments. He doesn't answer questions in class, but will in email quite promptly. He makes class fun and provides extra credit!
This professor does not answer questions. If you are a student who can just take notes and not ask questions to understand, you'll be fine. I need to ask questions to understand and he just ignores my arm up. Im a 4.0 student and not doing well at all. He doesn't typically teach social psych but this year he did and it wasn't a good experience.
He is so nice and made the class really interesting. This was one of my favorite classes I have ever taken.
Dr. Weaver is a great prof. I have had him for 2 classes now and I highly recommend. He is lecture heavy but they are not mandatory. He rarely if ever gives homework and the exams are pretty straight forward if you are someone who takes notes and pays somewhat of attention. Great dude. Highly recommend.
Favorite professor at MSU! Class is not too difficult if you attend and listen at the lectures and study hard for the exams. A lot of content but is very do-able. He is very personable and relates the lectures to everyday life so you can understand it. Take this class with him if you have the chance!
He is the best Professor I had so far. He is really good at teaching and makes the class interesting. The class is very manageable. Grading is super fare and you will get a 4.0 if you do everything and do decent on the exams. it requires a lot of studying but not too much. I would print the notes out before class and then write notes on them!
He cares about his students and their success, so the set up is clear and simple. This class requires a good amount of studying, memorizing, and practicing some applications; but there is no homework. Cramming is difficult, but possible. I highly recommend writing down things he says along side the powerpoint (already should be printed out).
He is honestly the best!! He gives his students so much leniency and extra credit. You can tell that he cares about his job and his students. This class is super easy as long as you go to the lectures and study. Its super interesting and he is super funny. If you take the class chances are that youll love him!!
I took this class because I had him in PSY 101 and he is so funny and a great professor. I found this class very challenging though, and wish I would have taken an easier ISS class for a GPA boost.
He is super nice and funny. Makes lectures fun and interactive.
Dr. Weaver is one of the best professors I've had at MSU. He gives great lectures that keep you engaged in the material. You do have to show up to class as there are clicker questions that count for participation points. You are almost better off not buying the textbook because it is only used for about 2-3 pages per chapter for a few questions.
Teacher name: Hensh, Richard
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Rick is a good calc prof. He's a really funny guy and he made class interesting. He definitely knows what he's talking about, but sometimes he overestimates how well his students grasp concepts from previous courses. I liked that before every lecture, he would play youtube videos of 90s alt/grunge bands that he liked. Made learning calc 3 tolerable
Hensh is a great teacher. He expects good things out of his students, but is wonderful at answering questions and is pretty funny when he wants to be.
Rick Hensh was a great calc 2 professor. His exams and quizes are sometimes on the more difficult side but if you go to class he does great lectures on the material. Also, he is very caring and put together weekend study session for our class. Be ready for bad dad jokes though!
Quiz almost every Friday, nice guy and explains things well.
Very good professor, enjoys his job, would take one of his classes again.
EXTREMELY HARD CLASS. Be ready to put in work to pass, and even more if you would like to 4.0. Hensh is a very smart guy and definitely knows what he's talking about but spends more time 'proving' how to do things than explaining it. You don't really have to go to class, but hit up the MLC and do lots of homework problems if you're struggling.
He knows what he's talking about, but doesn't teach it well. He did not help explain anything in lecture. I was lost from the beginning, so I failed the course. I would advise looking for a different professor.
The class is difficult but he does a good job teaching.  Don't buy the book unless you use to it study. Prof puts plenty of optional practice problems online as well as helpful homework problems. He is very approachable and has no problem putting in extra time to help you
bad
I had the "honor" of studying high school math with Mr. Hensh. Yes, I did say Mr. Hensh, as he does not have a PhD. Mr. Hensh enjoyed rambling on about the importance of knowing vocabulary and only glossed over crucial topics. He would get lost halfway into a proof and realize that he hadn't done it right. If you love learning on your own, take him
Explains the vocab way too much. Rarely teaches actual problems. If you want to teach yourself then I suggest him. Anyone else try to avoid him at all costs.
Its a hard class but he is a great man and very helpful outside the classroom. Well respected family man. He is a hard grader, or at least the TA was. But he teaches difficult concepts very well and is very approachable if you don't understand. I recommend him 100% for anyone taking on calc 2
Thinks he is talking to Graduate students and so explains mathematical situations quite obscurely.
Fairly hard class, but Hensh tries his best to help out. I'm retaking it with a different teacher to raise my grade.
Funny guy, easy to understand, extremely hard grader, though.
good teacher, go to class and review sessions, they help you alot
Great guy, hard class
Fun prof, but the course is really hard, for me at least.  I gave you some hotness Ricky because you were complaining about it!
I don't like how he has the overheads...it's harder to learn when you have read all of the stuff
Congratulations, your getting a curve.
Teacher name: Rautman, Alison
School name: Michigan State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Professor Rautman is so passionate about her work it makes the class interesting. The material is not so exciting, but the work is not hard and the exams are pretty straight forward
Very good prof. Really easy and a guaranteed 4.0 if you show up and do your homework. Lectures are a little dry and lengthy, but other than that a really good professor.
The class is graded by attendance quizzes (given randomly throughout every class, you can only miss 4), tophat interactive readings, and exams. The exams are brutal, but all online. Would NOT recommend taking this as an 8 AM, the content is SO boring and it's hard to stay awake.
Rautman's lectures were boring but you had to go because there were online quizzes. You also have to purchase tophat because a majority of the first half of the semester's work was on that. You do read two interesting books during the second half of the semester. Overall, this class was a easy A because of the online tests and easy points.
Interesting lectures but ultimately you could miss them and it wouldn't be too bad. Lots of online work but very easy and usually due at the end of the week with plenty of time to do it. A pretty easy class overall but I also learned a lot.
She is very enthusiastic about teaching this class, but the subject is very boring. Overall this class was very easy and an easy 4.0.
Alison is a work of art. She is a strange woman, however is very understanding and willing to work with you. If you complete the assignments and show up to class you should get a 4.0.
Professor Rautman is a sweet woman, but I made the mistake of taking her class at 8 am and missed a lot but she does quizzes every class for attendance so if you take her class make sure you get there. Nothing is too hard, but the tests are pretty detailed and tough. Tophat is pricey and you have to buy multiple reading books.
Easy A with online exams. Uses an online textbook with work in it but thats easy too. Lectures are kind of confusing but if you do the work in the textbook you will be fine. Recitation is also really helpful.
she is extremely rude. too much reading and quizzes. one of the worst classes i've ever taken. the class is so long and boring.
Don't just take my word for it. Look at the history of her reports on this site. Prof. Rautman has given up. Her lectures are the exact content from the $125 course pack. She describes herself as neurotic and probably is. Her emails are, as someone else her has put it, rude and unprofessional. She still has errors on her exams.
If you would like a teacher who tells you to be a democrat this is the class to take! I will say she will help you during office hours if you need it. You do not need to go to lectures (she doesn't really teach). She does a very good job of keeping everything online. I would not recommend.
Dr. Rautman means well, but ber class is simply ineffective. Like many ISS and IAH courses, I feel like I've focused more on strategically getting test-taking rather than actual learning. Her exam and quiz questions are very tricky and give me excess anxiety. I don't think she facilitates her course well and I regret taking this course.
Professor Rautman was such a great Prof to have at State right off the bat. While she is very lecture heavy, she is willing to answer questions during class if you have any. She kept up to date on what is happening in the world and is VERY knowledgeable in her field of anthropology. She made the class fun... even for an 8 a.m. Dr. Rautman is great!
She was unwilling to accept she had made a mistake on a quiz (didn't provide the correct answer to the question as an option) and was unwilling to explain her reasoning. She got upset when she was asked about this error and acted immaturely and unprofessionally.
Extremely easy 4.0. Attendance is not mandatory and pretty much everything was posted online to D2L. There are ungraded weekly quizzes that you can take unlimited times with answers. The weekly graded quizzes pull their questions from the ungraded quizzes and the exams pull questions from the previous quizzes. So easy if you do the quizzes a lot.
This was probably one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. It was supposed to be easy but the material was so dry I did not do nearly as well and I should've.  She is very rude and will call students out in class for no reason in front of everyone. Would not take one of her classes again.
Personally did not like this Professor at all. Was not helpful when sent emails, or even when asked questions face to face. Lectures were extremely long, which were not even necessary to go to based on the fact that all slides for lecture were online. Responses to emails were rude and unprofessional.
Boring class. Long long long lectures. Confusing. Gets distracted easily.
I honestly love Rautman. I did not deserve a 3.5 in this course by any means. My class was an 8am and I maybe went 10 times. She gives you very helpful lecture slides and previous exams to study from. She isn't out to trick you- she genuinely wants students to do well in her course. She's a super nice and funny person, I wish I went to class more.

Teacher comments: 
Professor Negy has really entertaining lectures, however he is probably the most disorganized professor I've ever had. All his grades are 20-question exams and one 3 credit extra credit paper (which I recommend doing). So much info needed for such tiny exams, and he doesn't provide any guide to know what the exams focus on. Wouldn't take him again.
*SEXUAL BEHAVIORS* literally the best class to take, graded on four tests only and an extra credit paper was given. No textbook, everything is lecture based and the powerpoints are not online. sassy and super funny. Dr Negy if u see this i love u and ur class. i dropped out bc im broke but i would take more of ur classes if i hadnt.
I didn't really like this class because of his tests. They're mostly questions regarding minor details that if you miss when taking notes, you'll get a bad grade. I remember one was regarding what food a person mentioned they wanted during a video when discussing a psychological phenomenon. You don't basically create a transcript, you will do badly
He is very sassy, but that makes lectures go by fast. Material is interesting and he tells a lot of funny stories. Make sure you write down everything he says because that is what tests are based on (doesn't post pwp slides and no textbook). 4 exams, no final. Take good notes and exams will be easy. Easy extra credit assignment- do it!
Negy is a true gem, one of those professors you won't soon forget. He has a passion for his field and it shows, every topic was made interesting and while the lectures were long (with every word being fair game for the test), I was never bored in this class. If you don't have an open-mind &amp; sense of humor, this isn't the professor for you.
Great professor. This is not a class that you can skip, all of the test are lecture based. I recommend that you take notes during the class and that you create a group me so someone can send you notes on details that you might missed.
I took his class weekly 6pm 3 hour class. Usually we were let out early, but honestly it didnt matter because time went by really fast in his class due to how fun it was. Completely engaging teacher who isnt afraid to voice his opinion. You have to take a lot of notes to pass bc all of his exams are based off of anything mentioned in-class.
Tests are crazy specific and hard. Pay attention to the videos in class!!! He tests you based on if you showed up to class or not and payed attention.. barely anything tested about actually psychology..
You have to pay attention to little details that are in lectures or videos. They will pop up on the test and you'll be confused, as some of his test questions are completely irrelevant to the course material and he'll just throw them in there to see if you're paying close attention.
By the end of the semester, I could not tolerate his behavior. He only thinks himself. Some of his information was interesting and I did learn; however, he was biased on cultures and religions from his own experiences. So, needless to say, that is what you are tested on. When you are taking his test: think like him, not yourself
Really cool guy but can be really sassy and snappy. Not much on the slides and there's no book, so you'll be taking notes the whole time. 3 exams and 1 extra credit paper. Not that hard but some exam questions are things he has never specified. No study guides, it's a ton to study for such short tests, some very specific questions. Gotta study
look, this professor is a NIGHTMARE. No joke, he's absolutely terrible. Awful lectures that are just all over the place and no study materials given during the week. It's terrible. Don't take classes from this professor if you can help it.
This course is not that hard, but with this professor it is! I failed two exams because there was no book for this course! He doesn't share his notes or videos on Webcourses! I really didn't know from where and how to study for the exams.. He always thinks he's right and doesn't like to be wrong about anything
In Negy's class, you gotta pay really close attention to minute details because that is usually what he tests for. He had us read two books, I skimmed through both and was fine. His textbook did not appear on the exams at all. Just focus on the little details, write the extra credit paper, and you'll be fine.
You're only graded on a couple quizzes, and they are a bit difficult. Don't expect to get an A if you don't study and take good notes. Doesn't post any lectures online, so attendance is a necessity and write down almost everything he says, even if you don't think it's important. I've had him for two classes now and he's a very interesting prof.
I love professor Negy!!! Great teacher. Very smart knows what hes talking about and super funny! I have him for three hours Tuesday nights and he made sure the class was not bored. Super interesting. I would have gotten an A but somehow messed up one of my tests. If you read his book and go to class you will have no problems. Wish I could go again
Pro. Negy is a great lecturer! I've taken him twice and he was great in both classes. No homework, but read two books + his book for exams. Only had 5, with the last being the final exam. Each had only 20 questions, in-class. Did have extra credit. Did send articles for us to read about a topic covered in class too.
I am a solid B student and this class was an absolute joke. His lectures are disorganized and does not give you access to his notes online. There are 5 tests which have no relation to his textbook (he is the author) and it was expensive. He goes through the material quickly so nothing even abides to his syllabus. I wish I took this class online.
His lectures are worth waiting for. i loved going to his classes bcus they were so much fun. Did i have to study ? yes absolutely. But as long as u understand and u dont just memorize youll be fine!
Negy is the most hilarious professor at UCF, does not care if he offends you at all. Expresses all of his opinions. Wrote his own book, memorize it &amp; you'll do good (not hard its like a summary of a normal book, just important info). MC exams in class, got an A on all of them. Very entertaining lectures, I took a 3 hr night class, usually out early

Teacher comments: 
This professor is really sweet and she allows quizzes to be made up rate after exams which is great because i'm already prepared. She often brings up nursing stories since she used to be a nurse and this made the class more interesting. I 100% recommend her!
Everything you need is in the powerpoints and realizeIT. Attendance is required as she does squarecap sometimes to confirm but this isnt a skip class you wont pass type of course. Like I said everythings given along w/ lab info and practice tests. Plus with HS bio knowledge its a very easy class, got As on every test
This class was very easy. As long as you know biology from high school, you should get a good grade in this class with minimal studying.
MsThomas was a good professor, shes super sweet and doesnt make the class harder than it is. Going to SARC tutoring REALLY helped I would go unless youre getting 100s. She is passionate and knows what shes talking about. Attendance is taken sometimes in the form of an online question. Bio 1 material is the type thats easy to study off flashcards!
Funniest professor by far. She makes lecture fun with her stories and jokes. She does go through power points fast but she posts them on Canvas. She always made her/the TA's office hours very clear to help us if we needed it. She dropped low grades and was lenient with due dates. I was able to skip some classes and not be far behind.
nice lady. she reads from the slides but does a good job on explaining topics. a lot of people don't like her or say the class is hard, but it is really not difficult. you have a lab, an online activity, and her lectures usually all covering the same topic so there is really no excuse to not understand concepts. if you go to class/study youll pass
Do the lab, show up to class, and study the practice exams/important topics. Really not hard to get an A/B
Thomas is a very good lecturer but the class requires studying outside of it. SARC session are about an 2 1/2 hours but they explain the material very very well I highly recommend attending them.
I hated bio in highschool but got a 98 in this class. Honestly since it's standardized if you just memorize stuff and read the book a little you'll be ok. I got 100s on two of the tests. She drops a test and a quiz on top of the other extra credit it's really had to fail this.
An amazing professor, makes the class interesting and very clear on grading and expectations. Professor Thomas is always there for her students, extra credit is very possible and easy. Don't be afraid to use SARC and SI and don't forget to do the labs (all online)
Professor Thomas is a nice, helpful, and caring lady. Sometimes she can go off topic with her stories. She explains difficult concepts well. If you need help I would recommend going to SARC. There are five exams including the final. The lowest test and quiz grade is dropped. She does questions off of Square Cap for a small % of your grade.
I only passed this class because of sarc ( thankyou john :)) Professor thomas is very nice but she tends to go off topic alot and i end up just recording it and writing notes later because i cant concentrate. The material is not hard but on her tests she words everything weirdly so make sure you know the material.
Mrs. Thomas is a great professor! I was a bit nervous to take her class because your grade is pretty much determined by the four exams (lowest dropped), quizzes, and final exam. But, shes a great lecturer and keeps you aware of assignments and exams that are coming up. I enjoyed her class and worked hard for my A :)
An actual queen! I cant say anything bad about this woman. Biology is a difficult subject but as long as you go to all the reviews provided and STUDY you should do well in this class. Thomas gave extra credit and dropped lowest test grade. I wish I could have her again for Chemistry because she is a professor who cares about her students success
Professor Thomas was such a great lady to have as a teacher. Her class is difficult but if you study and do everything you will be fine. I was a little scared in the beginning because I was not doing very well, but she gives many opportunities to get your grade up. Show up for class because you will have little one question participation quizzes.
Difficult class but an amazing professor. There are many opportunities to help your grade out. If you go to class, study a lot before exams, and put in the necessary effort, you will do well.
Could earn an extra 2% on top of your final grade for extra credit. Lecture heavy class with occasional in-class activities that count for points. Lots of material covered in a relatively short amount of time. Definitely must go to the majority of classes if you want a decent grade
She is the sunshine the world needs. Her lectures are great, and she genuinely cares about your grade. Obviously you will have to study and do some work, but it's bio... She prepares you so well for tests that if you study the review guides you will pass. She does a great job making jokes and keeping things light and fun.
Not a health sciences major, so I was bored with this class. Do the labs (easy) and study the powerpoints, every answer from every test comes from her powerpoints posted for you. Utilize all the materials in each module... Prof Thomas gives you a study guide for a reason... Easy A/B.. You'll pass if you review, Don't show up to a test without it
She is kind of dry in lecture but a lot of information is given. You will need to study a lot in addition to attending lecture. The lab part of the classes was the easiest but the test were quite difficult if you didn't prepare well. She does try to help boost your grade by dropping some assignments.

good
very good
good class teacher
He is the best!
Didn't even buy the book. Didn't show up to class and passed with a B. Gives study guides that are essentially the test. Take this class lol! 4 Exams
Highly recommend this teacher to anyone who needs an easy A. Power points are all online, and the tests are extremely easy if you actually study. Lectures can be boring, but he tries to make it as interesting as possible. Curves test grades. No homework, like at all. Don't bother buying the textbook, it's still sitting in my room unopened.
The man is a legend, everyone should take him! You will learn more about life from taking one class of his than you would in an entire lifetime. He teaches beyond the course. Probably the hottest professor on campus too.
He's adorable. Only 4 tests the whole term, didn't even need the textbook because he reviews what is on the test the week prior. If I paid attention more, it would have been a legit easy A. BEWARE THE MONKEYS THOUGH!!
Boring class but he tries to make it enjoyable. I went to the first couple classes, then realized you can just go to the reviews before the test and do fine. Tests aren't too hard would recommend if you don't want to go to class and need a science credit.
Overall a decent professor. You don't have to go to class each session, just make sure to take notes on the powerpoints he uploads for each exam, go to the class before each exam for example questions (I found those helpful). You probably won't need the textbook so don't bother, I didn't use one and got an A, just studied his powerpoints.
This is probably the easiest class I've ever taken. Textbook isn't used and attendance wasn't necessary either. Literally just read through the slides, take notes, and do the practice tests and you'll get an A. The tests are REALLY similar to the practice tests so make sure you memorize that. He also curves grades at the end of the semester.
Dr. Long has 4 exams throughout the year, all weighted equally with a slight curve. The course started off with pretty easy concepts that carried over from high school biology. However, the last two exams required you to know certain dig sites and scientific names. All presentations are online and good info on Quizlet.
Buying book is a waste of $60, he picks and chooses material so much you're better off only looking at the slides he posts. You don't have to go to class, but he often tells you questions or details directly on the test that you won't find on the power points. You'll either love or roll your eyes at his jokes but he's an overall a really nice guy.
He reads off of the powerpoints in class, with test question give-aways and dry humor sprinkled in. Don't bother going to class, but DO bother to teach yourself the material and review for the tests beforehand. You'll be fine.
His lectures can be kind of boring sometimes but he's quite funny and nice. There are only four tests so you have to study well but he gives a huge curve. There are review days right before the test so make sure you go to those. Don't get the book. The only thing graded are the tests.
This class was super easy. His classes are all lectures based off his powerpoints. I barley went to class only on class day before the exam and still passed with an A. Super easy, study the "old test questions" even though they're not the same exact ones on the test they're VERY similar so you'll do good.
George Long is the man! His lectures can be a little repetitive and boring, but he is kind, funny, and just a sweet old man! If you study the power points that are posted online and actually try, you will do well!
I thought this class was going to be easy but IT'S NOT. If you're looking for an easy A anthropology class, do not take this one.  I studied for the tests really hard and still got C's, and tests are the only thing in the grade book. I would have honestly liked some homework just so I would be able to bring my grade up.
He is super nice but easily one of the most disorganized professors I've ever had. He posts PowerPoints online but the ones he uses in class are different, making it difficult to follow along. His grammar, punctuation, and organization of the PowerPoints and other documents is not very good and is also hard to understand. I do not recommend taking!
Long is really nice. He posts his powerpoints but will tell you things to watch out for during exams in class. I attended class about 60% of the time and did just fine. 4 exams (1 being the "final") that are split among 3-4 chapters each. He hosts a review day the class period before the exams. As long as you keep up with the slides you will do ok.

Teacher comments: 
Easy class to pass. I suggest you take a whole day to do the training and attempt the project till you get your desired grade. It was the most effective in my opinion. You can have the chapters read to you by the book and take minimal notes and do good on the concept assignments. No test or quizzes, just do the assignments and you will do good.
He has a very heavy accent and I can barely understand what he is saying when I went to his office hours for an online Computer Science class. The class uses Microsoft Access. Unfortunately for me, that program doesn't work on Apple devices. I had to literally go in the campus library to do the assignments.
This is by far the worst professor I have had at UCF. The lectures are dragged out and he will ramble. The tests have NOTHING to do with the class and the grammar is so poor it is difficult to understand the questions to begin with. You will be lectured on topics that have no practical use to your major. If you don't have to skip this class.
Attendance not mandatory, but he ALWAYS offer you an extra credit at the end of the lecture. Come to class to get the extra credit because the exam is hard. All powerpoint and notes is in the webcourse, but it is always handy to take an extra note. I would suggest to come to class, unless you can get 85 something in his exams.
definitely take this class online! the assignments were super easy; i know some people that finished them the first week. the exams were difficult but just have the powerpoints up and command F the information and you should be able to get at least a B. definitely do not buy the book - i made that mistake.
This dude literally bumped the grade on my term paper from a 0% to a 90% after I mistakenly did it late, just because I came in and visited him 3-4 times. Great guy although his accent is pretty thick.
I took this class online and it was amazing. The assignments were the easy part as long as you read over the previews. The exams were the harder part with it being specific questions that you have to remember. He does give a half useful study guide but it is still hard unless you read and memorize. He doesn't grade A+,B,C-. He grades A, B,or C.
Easily the worst professor I've had at UCF. The concepts he teachers are absolutely irrelevant to the course. Many of the information on his powerpoint are incorrect. His english is subpar at best, which wouldn't be an issue except he constantly makes spelling errors on tests that change the entire question. Lab is fine, the lecture is horrible.
This class was terrible. Seriously terrible. The lectures are pointless unless you want a VERY small amount of extra credit. Everything is done online. I really wish I took this class online. He's impossible to understand because of a thick accent (not his fault) but it doesn't help that he's just mean. If you need this course, do it online.
I never went to class because all of the information you need to know is on the powerpoints that he put online. I should've taken the online class. If you do go to class you will not understand a word he was saying and I can't handle that for more than 2 hours.
He is hard to understand, but you don't need to show up to class to do well (he does give extra credit at the end of each class). Just study his power points and you'll do well in the class. Tests are taken from home and labs can be completed from home (finished them all in the first two weeks). He cares about his students.
Bc I took this class online, it was flexible w my schedule and easy for me! I studied all the chapters for the lectures the day of the exam and received an average of a low A! Tests were open book, so I personally found them easy. Although I did not find the lectures useful for me, the lab portion taught me a lot.
He is very hard to understand. You don't need to see him at all, lecture attendance is not required. Tests are open book (his book is free). Lab part of class was very simple. Should be an easy a, but don't expect anything special or inspirational.
thick accent, doesn't answer questions, tries to scare you and say 1/3 of you will pass (biggest joke of my life). grade is based off 10 SAM assignments (easy and can get help from TA), 1 paper (easy and graded by TA so easy graded), and 3 tests (online so just have the notes up and Command+F everything). If you have a MAC i promise you'll be fine.
The homework for the class is relatively easy, however, the tests have nothing to do with the homwork and you have to teach yourself everything because he is so incredibly difficult to understand. He speaks very poor enlgish. I'm usually able to understand people with accents but he was extremely difficult. I understood about every third word.
Labs are easy, with the hw assignments just projects or quizzes in MS excel, word, etc, and the research paper is also easy as long as you follow instructions. The professor offers extra credit quizzes at the end of every lecture, so these are the main reason to go to class. The powerpoints are needed for the tests, which are somewhat difficult.
easy A as long as you go to lecture (he has extra credit quizzes at the end of every class) and do the lab assignments which are also really easy. Tests are hard if you don't have his powerpoints in front of you but if you do the answers are usually word-for-word. Didn't actually learn anything in the class &amp; his accent makes it hard to understand
Hard to understand, honestly better off not listening, writing whatever's on the powerpoints, and getting your extra credit points at the end of each lecture. Assignments have nothing to do with the lecture material since they focus completely on Microsoft Office, while the exams have nothing to do with the labs since they focus on the lectures.
Dr. Abdullah has a very thick accent so it is kind of hard to understand him. Half of this class was lab based. He has 3 exams and no finals and the exams are super easy if you use your notes. He is the ONLY professor who teaches this subject. Attendance isn't mandatory but at the end of every class he does a pop quiz that'll give you extra credit.
Absolute WORST class. Can't understand the lectures, horribly heavy accent. Dr. Abdallah is literally teaching inaccurate information about computers. I had a friend who is a computer science major look over the notes and told me that pretty much everything he read was false. Try to avoid if possible.
Teacher name: Brophy-Ellison, James
School name: University of Central Florida
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
This class is an easy A, with a professor who is a lot of fun to listen to. His lectures often aren't about the topic, but more his own experiences and musings. The head TA was very nice and lead a few "homework days" for getting stuff done. Dr Brophy cares about your success and wants you to learn what you need to know, not just get another credit
I took him for a 6 week online summer course. I missed a minimum of five assignments which were weighed heavily. Three assignments were 20 points. One was 50 points and one was even for 100 points. I passed with a B. An 80 or an 89 will still give you a B. All quiz answers are found online. No need to purchase the book. You cant fail this class!!!
Dr. Brophy was an incredible Professor who made learning FUN! He curses tp get your attention... and guess what.... it WORKS! People need to lighten up! I credit him with putting me on the path to becoming the successful psychologist that I am today! Thank you Dr. Brophy! You are awesome!
I hate everything about this class. From the clay models, coloring, speeches, juggling videos. When I say juggling videos - I mean actual videos of you juggling. The class is not difficult; however, I don't consider any of these assignments beneficial to me or my degree.
The TA will be who you communicate to about everything. You can extend due dates if you need it. You will be required to learn how to juggle and there are a few fun and easy projects. There are quizzes and test (I don't remember how many). He gives extra credit and there are a few papers. Easy class I just didn't put in the work for the juggling.
The worst prof I've had between the 2 schools i've attended. Rambles irrelevantly the whole class. Puts passcodes on assignments you'd otherwise could do at home properly. Gives bonus points, but they hurt you if you dont do them? He and TA's do not answer emails at all. grading scale is very unclear and has you guessing your grade for the semester
Best prof for Research Methods! Classes are smaller for a usual UCF psych class, and participation matters. Material is learned through reading the book, and quizzes are given each class on the chapters. Tends to ramble in lecture, but is interesting to learn and applies research methods to real-life situations. No big research paper.
Literally, the best teacher I've ever met/taken (out of all the teachers I've had my whole life. Take him!
Goes off on irrelevant lectures for most of the class. Uses ableist and discriminatory language. The TA teaches and is unorganized. Grades and assignments are posted and due at random. 5 weeks in and havent learned a thing. I have 3 peges of notes so far. Easy A if you come to class and humor him for 3 hours.
I thought his online class was very structured and very clear on what was expected.  Super easy! Tons of extra credit opportunities that there is no reason you shouldn't pass with an A.
This class was an easy A. Chapter quizzes were super easy, as were the tests (4 of them). You NEED the book in order to do well on the quizzes and exams. Come word for word out of text. Mainly get help from his TA's if you need any. There's a juggling assignment, but it was actually really fun. He offers SO MUCH extra credit.
Great Professor!
This professor is great! I took his class online &amp; felt that it was probably one of the  most organized classes but super easy! The material itself is difficult but as long as you read the book you'll do fine. He has ALOT of work due though on the same day, usually a preview quiz, quiz &amp; then some other misc assignments. OVERALL HE WAS GREAT.
Dr. Brophy is one of the best professors at UCF. If you have the chance to take him, please do. He genuinely wants you to know the information, but will also care about  the things that pop up in life and work with you on missed assignments/extra credit. Seriously, if you have the choice between him and any other professor, always choose Brophy.
Dr. Brophy isn't your usual professor, and I think this is what makes him special. In class he tells a lot of stories which can sometimes seem off topic, but I learn more from him than professors who just read off Powerpoint. He really does show that he cares about his students, and he's not afraid to kid with them. Don't take yourself so serious.
poor teacher. If you want to actually learn something don't take him. Lectures are loooong and he gets off topic. swears a lot and doesnt care about you.
Dr. B. is funny, witty, brings more education to class than one could ever hope to receive from a text.  Take him for every class he teaches... he is a remarkable lecturer!   Cares about his students, knows his topics.  There aren't enough words to praise Dr. B.  Makes you want to be there, to learn. Wouldn't trade classes with him for anything.
Nice guy. gets off topic easily.
His class was an easy A, but his lectures were pointless and often unrelated to the class. He tried to use creative tactics to teach us, like making us juggle or make clay models of the brain, however If you actually want to get something out of the class I would not recommend this professor.
Best teacher I've had so far! Awesome lecturer, makes the class interesting (and I have a great dislike for physiology lol), &amp; definitely interested in finding new ways to teach his students things. Also very considerate! Heard the bookstore was selling his book for $200+ and told the students to not buy it/return it. Would take him for everything!

Teacher comments: 
Lecture exams are difficult and you really have to know your stuff to do well on them. Theres a curve for each exam. Dr. Samsam really wants everyone to do well and isn't trying to fail anyone thats why he gives the curves. Lab exams are there to buffer your grade but you have to study so I recommend library sessions. Difficult but doable.
Dr. Samsam really knows his stuff! The lecture exams are difficult if you dont keep up with the reading. The labs are easy if you go to the library sessions. The class requires a lot of time but it's definitely doable. He also gives a 20% curve to your final grade, so definitely do all the drawings if you want the full curve!
Very hard class but do-able. WILL make you work for the grade. I had to record the lectures AND read the book
Dr. Samsam was probably the most intelligent professor I've ever had. His class was hard, but doable. The extra credit drawings were lifesavers. He said he would round 87-89s to an A, as I had an 88, but kept mine as B for some reason. Go to class or else he will take the 20% curve away from you.
Dr. Samsam is the most knowledgeable professor I have ever (and will ever) encounter. We did every single page of the book and you need to study EVERYTHING. Study every day if you want to pass. He taught me so much but be prepared for a rollercoaster. He curves generously and wants us to succeed. My raw score was 58.5% and I passed with a B.
Very difficult class but very doable if you put in the work! Gives generous curves and a few extra credit opportunities. Try to do your best in lab as it will greatly help your overall grade!
Dr. Samsam does not make this class easy but it is doable and getting an A is possible. Not going to lie, it was very challenging but between lab, curves, and extra credit you can pass if you try hard enough. Listen to lectures carefully, follow the textbook and power-point and spend A LOT of time studying and you can do it.
This class is by far one of the most difficult I have taken since Dr. Samsam is crazy smart and really wants his students to be ahead of other students around the nation. Be prepared to spend every day reading for a couple of hours, practice the models in the library, and pay attention during lecture. You will learn so much. I would take him again.
Anatomy is hard but prof. Samsam makes it much easier. Go to class, record the lectures, learn his drawings. He's very well respected and if you take his class you'll understand why. It's not an easy A but if you put in time its definitely doable. He gives huge curves on every test but don't rely on that alone. One of the best professors at UCF
Very respected and youll see why. Very caring man and genuinely wants students to pass his course, has an accent and speaks lowly but not impossible to understand. I am the book and the book is me he wrote the book for the course so read read read! If youre dedicated to passing you will! Record the lectures and study ahead of time. Good luck!
Extra Credit will save you...
LAB WILL SAVE YOUR GRADE, stay above lecture average and the test curves will keep you at an A. To me, the class was easier than microbiology but more work. Memorization in this class is the key, use the models in the library for lab and his textbook for lecture, stay ahead of studying and its very possible to get an A. Took this in 6 weeks
Dr. Samsam is brilliant but this class is brutal. I studied every day for hours as if it were finals week every test. Lab will save your grade so pay attention and study often. Was above avg every test but bombed the final (31/100; avg 48) still managed a B in the class thanks to his curves. You do learn so much though so that is rewarding.
Dr. Samsam is a great professor and is really knowledgeable, but it's definitely a challenge to pass his class. Definitely go to lecture, or at least get a good recording of it because tests are based off points he goes over in class + the textbook. Don't slack off on lab as IT WILL save your grade. He curves generously, but only if you show up!
This is probably the most challenging class I have ever taken. You can't take this class as a joke, you should be studying everyday otherwise you will fall behind. Definitely very rewarding when you're finished and see how much material you now know.
Try to sit near the front because Dr. Samsam is soft spoken and has a thick accent. If you don't come to class, you'll find it very difficult to prepare for the exams. Passionate lecturer and test heavy but he also gives GENEROUS curves given how difficult the material is. Dr. Samsam is caring and wants his students to do well.
His lectures are fast-paced, and tests are tough, but he makes you learn the material. Textbook is required, make sure you read it and especially the clinical points. Give his class all the time and effort it deserves. Extra credit drawings can be grade savers, and he gives generous curves.
Multiple choice exams (10) in spring. I almost studied 2 hours in the library very day pointing at models and read the textbook for 2 hours every day taking notes. I attended both scheduled lectures though I signed up for one. He talks very fast and sometimes mumbles but he has lots of extra credit. I had a 59% on Webcourses before the curve and EC
Dr. Samsam's anatomy class is one of the most challenging courses i've ever taken. With that being said, it was also the most rewarding classes i've ever taken. The class truly isn't difficult but that doesn't mean you don't have to work for an A, you learn so much but I loved every minute of it. Powerpoints, textbooks, labs are crucial!
It was an honor to have Dr. Samsam as a professor. He is an extremely respected and intelligent individual. His exams are very difficult therefore he prepared to spend a good amount of time studying. The curves definitely help you, but you still have to put in work.

Teacher comments: 
Met 6x through out the whole semester and you don't learn in those meetings you just do group work that you can barely finish in the time given. She brags and laughs at the fact that no one passes her exams. Her extra credit? (That I got 100% on) brought my grade up from an 81.21% to an 81.29%. You teach yourself all the lessons. AVOID if you can.
Tests are purposefully vague and careless in choice of language, leading to answers differing from definitions offered in the text. I.E. You answered the question correctly, but you got it wrong. Either the TAs write them or they are copied from somewhere.
I've only been in this class for a few weeks and I can already tell it's going to be a bad experience. Her teaching methods are questionable as she wants us to "teach ourselves" through the online textbook. Her homework is graded very tough and the material is even tougher. She's seemingly the type of professor who wants you to fail.
Study. Find good study groups. Show up when you have class. Actually do the homework (dont copy) otherwise you will not do well. It takes effort. See the TAs and try your best. This is NOT an easy A for some and does take effort. So expect to work for your good grades. She is a decent teacher and could be way better, but as I said, she's decent.
This class made you work for your grade. I personally spent hours taking notes from the online textbook and sitting down on my own and try to fully understand the subject. She does drop a few homework grades, an exam, quizzes and multiple extra credit opportunity. Go to TA hours. Definitely my hardest class, hard work pays off.
This was the worst class Ive every taken out of my college career. &amp; the WORST professor ever. What she gives you to study for the exams are NOTHING like what is actual on the exams. You teach yourself everything in the course so if you cant learn that way youre screwed. &amp; this only meet 5 times out of the semeste 1hr only makes matters worse.
This class is the hardest class out of my whole college career. Second time taking this class and still havent learned anything.
Dr. Underwood is a great teacher. You meet 5 times in the entire semester (about every two weeks) discussing the topics that were discussed in the homework. She has several TA's and is very open. The grading criteria are clear and she answers any questions you may have. During the class meetings she has activities that help explain the material.
Awful teacher.
Professor Underwood is extremely helpful during her class meetings. Unfortunately that is only a few times a semester. The book is difficult to study from so make sure not to miss a lecture. She will sit with you and help you through a problem if you ask for help. Exams are hard but she does offer a good amount of extra credit. Solid choice.
One of the HARDEST classes I ever took &amp; School isn't usually hard for me. It was a hybrid or mixed mode class, 5 MANDATORY meetings &amp; the exams are BARELY like the quizzes &amp; homework. She held 2 reviews one for exam 2 &amp; one for the final. I failed all of the exams except one. She does offer EC &amp; she does drop the lowest assignments. (Grade: 78 C+)
Its one of the hardest classes I took in UCF. You learn everything yourself because we meet only 5 times, and in class she only gives you assignments with no explanations.
She herself is not too tough on grading but her TA is. She does a very good job explaining things and never assumes you already know something. Work is required for this class but that is to be expected, because its a 4000 level course. She makes the class interesting when it doesnt necessarily have to be.
really good instructor but it's a hard class. Do A LOT of practice problems &amp; get StudyCube to prepare for the exams and you'll do well.
Thoroughly enjoyed this course. Did not watch more than 3 lectures and ended with an A+. Make sure to read the textbook which is easy to understand and study her review guides.
I got a C+ in this class and it was difficult but she was an amazing professor. The best I've ever had. She lectured amazingly and really knows her stuff. There's 3 tests, 5 quizzes, and about 15 homework assignments. She drops your lowest quiz and 2-3 homeworks. She has some extra credit if you do the exam redos.
Very difficult class. She explains everything fine the first time, but review materials are scarce. I could never find a way to explicitly review for exams other than visiting the TAs. Don't take this class unless it's for your major. You will rip your hair out.
I had Professor Underwood this semester and in my honest opinion she was a great professor. Macro is a very difficult subject but with the help of her and the TA"s I was able. She offers a lot of extra credit opportunities and actually doing the extra credit will help you understand the content better. Her lectures are posted on webcourses.
This class is difficult, but not impossible. As long as you watch the lectures, pay attention, and work hard you can do it! After the quizzes, I went to visit the TA's and that SERIOUSLY helped. Go visit either Dr. Underwood or the TA's it helps so much for exams. She drops lowest test and homework. I enjoyed the class.
Dr. Underwood was great, but I had her lecture at 7:30 in the morning so I would usually rely on the recordings. However, attending the class in person always felt better, the lectures are fun, engaging, and really helped the information come to life.

Teacher comments: 
He loves the squeeze in a lesson whenever he can. Dont expect to have the whole time to take quizzes and tests
Very nice and has good intentions but hard to understand. Has a very thick hispanic accent and teaches very fast. The TA's are not much help. Aleks homework is very time consuming and he does not prepare you for your exams, especially the ACS part of the final. I would not recommend him at all unless you want to struggle. Only upside his grading.
I didn't use the textbook, but I had a decent chemistry background and knew most of it already. He is very helpful if you go to his office hours. He gives homework from the textbook that isn't graded, but he uses ALEKS as a homework grade. KEEP UP WITH ALEKS. Test or quiz every week.
He does care but w/ the thick accent and the messy slides I didnt learn anything from him. Attendance taken and all HW is through ALEKS (online website that doesnt let you move on until youve completed a certain number in a row correct). Even though it was time consuming (hours) I dont think I would have passed without it. Watch for deadlines!
Cons: An accent so thick I got a foreign language credit by the end of the course. Very test heavy - most of your grade will be exams. Prepare to learn by yourself. Pros: Funny, light-hearted personality. Makes class laugh almost every class. Detailed, but disorganized ppt slides.
I don't recommend him at all if your weakness is chem(my case). If you have experience then his class won't be too hard. There's a quiz every Wednesday and a test every three quizzes. Highly recommend going to SI because that's what saved me. He is lenient with grading which helps and make sure to always do the practice problems he assigns.
Be prepared to pretty much teach yourself EVERYTHING. This is definitely not an easy class. You can tell he really likes chemistry but just sucks at teaching. I would definitely recommend taking any other professor. The only plus is that he ended up curving the final.
Very thick accent and FLIES through lectures. Lectures are mandatory, but not helpful. You WILL need to teach yourself. Four tests, weekly quizzes, hw, classroom participation, and a final. 88 is an A, final can replace lowest test, and two quizzes/hw assignments dropped. Don't neglect hw, quizzes, or attendance. Tests come from powerpoint concepts
He cares about your grades, he uses ALEKS as homework, he does in class "Learning Catalytics", those are important so do not skip, he gives review problems before each quiz and exam, there is a quiz every week that are 5 points. He is hard to understand though and you definitely will need the textbook.
Honestly, even though he really likes chemistry and tries his best to make the students understand it, his explaining is not clear and I can't understand anything. I go to his lectures just because of attendance. I taught everything myself and it makes me mad that I had to pay for a course and professor that didn't even help me.
if you're a YouTube warrior take it but don't expect to learn anything from him. Pretty much all the time spent in class for me was a waste of time but I went for the attendance grade. His powerpoints are a convoluted mess. I suggest only doing the problems from his powerpoints and ignoring the textbook. Worst part of the class was aleks...
One of the absolute worst professors Ive ever had. Very heavy accent and hard to understand, and on top of that the slides he uses in class are a complete mess. Very disorganized and does not care at all for his students.
Lord help me. I've never been so stressed in my life. He covers so many slides before a test that it's hard to pinpoint what exactly you need to study. Failed all his quizzes somehow? But did ok on his tests. Literally almost dropped the class because I thought I was failing and I was going to SI.
Do not take class with this professor if you actually want to learn and succeed. He speaks as if he were just talking to himself instead of a huge lecture hall of students who've never taken chemistry before. Doesn't tell you exactly whats on the tests. His powerpoints are all just his scratch work and no explanation. At least SI is helpful.
Talks too fast and has a thick accent. Him and the SI leader will tell you to review the simple problems in the book, but the tests and quizzes will be more complicated. He sometimes holds the class longer by a couple minutes. His teaching style is unorganized. Sign up with a different professor please unless you are ok with teaching yourself.
He is a very kind person
CONFUSING. Quizzes once a week, tests after 3 quizzes. Taught myself everything from the textbook (he luckily goes by it exactly). Classes are mandatory yet his power points are gibberish. They have endless equations with no explanation. He speaks at a mile a minute. Don't get me started on ALEKS. Takes 3-4 hours to complete 8 topics. Stray away!!!
Patino is an excellent prof. He loves when people go to his office hours and will help you understand the material. Do the homework and practice problems he gives you and you can pass. you only need a 63 for a C. I studied the night before or the day of for all exams and quizzes and got an A on everything. Hw helps you understand the material a lot
One of the worst teachers I've had so far. I think he may do better one on one or with a smaller class, but he's so unorganized that I doubt it. I've taken classes with harder material, this class just sucks because of the professor. Take literally anyone else, or just teach yourself because the textbook doesn't do a bad job explaining.
I enjoy science a lot and have never had trouble in science classes, but this class was honestly awful. If you speak fluent Spanish you might be okay but I understood about 4 words every lecture. He means well, but I ended up having to teach myself everything. He also doesn't input your grade in webcourses until the end of the semester.

Teacher comments: 
He's pretty intimidating at first but, he's actually sweet. The powerpoints seem clustered at first but are useful if you jot down the fill in the blanks. SO GO TO CLASS Aleks was a main source of help, the explanations were really clear. 20 questions with 1 extra credit on tests. COLLECT YOUR TESTS easier than chem 1a less math
Such an amazing professor and would definitely try to take him for other chemistry classes. Gives you everything you need to pass the class. Only bad thing is he is a little hard to talk to.
Prof. Dixion's office hours are a lifesaver! You need to show up to class to get the info you need, do practice problems in the textbook, he's nicer and very helpful if he sees that you are putting in the time to pass his class. Your grade is made up of 5 exams + final + 5 quizzes but he drops the lowest quiz score and the online chem hw.
Dont take this professor if you want to pass. He lists what you need to learn and then expects you to teach yourself and moves really fast.
Its only been my first semester and he has been one of my favorite professors so far. He makes all the information you need accessable through webcourses and takes time with the information. I took AP Chemistry in high school and it was easier. However, if you do not have a basic understanding of chemistry it may be harder for you. Use the resource
I have taken a lot of chemistry classes and Donovan Dixon has to be the best professor I have had. He really knows how to organize the information into manageable bits so that you don't feel overwhelmed trying to digest it all. His notes are on powerpoints and they are really helpful. He gives extra credit quizzes online, highly recommended prof.
If you were successful in AP Chemistry or another college level chemistry, you will not find this course very challenging. Show up, pay attention and study. It is clearly not designed to be a difficult course and there seems to be a fair amount of extra credit.
Well respected and a good lecturer, pretty funny too. Tests are heavily based on lecture material, come to class and take notes (slides are posted but not complete) if you want to do well. WILL notice if you aren't paying attention! Tests aren't too bad, replaces lowest test grade with your final which was a huge help for me.
Very respectable and knowledgeable. Material is tough but you can get through it if you work for it. Has a cool personality and some lectures were interesting. He also does a good job of involving the class in his lectures. Sometimes he can be intimidating.
Professor Dixon is a well respected teacher among the students. His lectures were entertaining and he often involved the students. We worked out word problems in class and asked questions. His PowerPoint slides were very helpful on tests.
Show up to class, because all the tests are from the PowerPoints. He puts them online, but they are incomplete, and you have to take notes on them in class to complete them. As long as you take good notes, do the homework, and study the PowerPoints thoroughly, this class should be an easy A.
Overall an effective professor, but not an easy A. You must work for your grade that you earn and can not get by just doing the work in class: you must practice outside of the class. Must attend the lectures to get information from the powerpoint slides that he does not just give out. Tells you what topics are on the test as well as the final.
Dixon is funny and entertaining, his lectures were pretty rough for me but his office hours were invaluable. His PPT notes outline exactly what you should know for the test in the beginning so you know what to look for. I am extremely terrible at chem and still pulled out an A- (I suspect Dixon gave me a couple points when entering grades tho)
Dr. Dixon is a very funny and knowledgable professor that brought his knowledge and passion of chemistry to help his students to learn all of the material in the semester. Lectures and given PowerPoints are very helpful and I always knew which topics were on the test, and textbook was only used for further explanation and reference for homework.
This class started out tough but he explains all of the subjects well enough. However, the only way I did well was by doing practice with online material. He also gives tons of grace by dropping a lot of grades and replacing your lowest test score with the score on the final. If you have taken a chem class before, his class will be a cake walk.
Dixon's tests aren't difficult and the problems are very similar to ones he does in class for practice. The people who struggled in this class were the ones who didn't bother showing up or taking notes. Make sure to collect your tests since the final is pretty much random questions from each test with different numbers.
If you do review questions and go to lectures you will pass this class. Dixon was fair in grading and tests are extremely similar to the review questions at the end of each chapter and from what he goes over in class.
Extremely easy B/A, he lists all the topics on the exams before hand, youtube is your FRIEND. I didnt attend a single lecture and got two 100s on the exams, just make sure you truly understand the concepts and as this class is chem. for engineers, the topics are not in depth at all and pretty easy to understand
If you can't make it to class, make sure you have someone take pictures of the slides for you because the ones he gives students doesn't have everything in it. He isn't much help in office hours, but make sure to go collect the tests because the final has a lot of the same questions but with different numbers or answer choices.
The best part about his class is that he gives us the periodic table during tests! I know that a lot of professors don't give that out since they expect you to memorize it. But Dixon's motto is to never memorize, just learn. Overall his class is fun and entertaining and you learn chemistry, guaranteed. I would highly recommend him to anyone! :D

Teacher comments: 
3 exams, 3 quizzes, 3 lab quizzes every four modules. Overall grade is 45% of exams--test heavy course. Reading is a must. Exams are proctored. You need a webcam. Weekly web conferences--extremely helpful. Wouldn't recommend this course for full-time students. Test-heavy, harsh grading scale. She's willing to help, but the course is tough.
I respected Prof. Janowsky and she definitely knew a lot. Her online class had a lot of material to review, and she was very helpful. HOWEVER, I do believe this is one of the most fast-paced classes I have ever taken. She only gives you a few days to complete hours worth of tests. She also has tough assignments, graded heavily.
This professor is amazing. She is very clear on what will be on the tests. There IS homework, but it is preparing you for similar questions on the test. If you have to take Stats for Psych, TAKE HER!!!!
BEST PROFESSOR. I've never been the strongest at math but she makes everything so smooth. The way she sets up her homework, her lectures and she gives so much practice material. Her practice exams are an amazing guide and are so helpful. She makes her class so seamless. Thanks to Dr.J, I've learned to appreciate statistics and I enjoy the subject!
She is a wonderful professor. At first the course may scare you because she makes you remember all of the formulas but it isn't so bad. She prepares you soo much for the exams. The workload is pretty heavy but it all contributes to how well you do in the course.
She is a great lecturer, funny, organized &amp; cares. My biggest problem in this class and dropped my grade is that it does not seem like you have enough time for the timed exams. She should give 4 exams instead of 3. If you forget something you cannot move on to the next question sometimes. I have never experienced test anxiety until this class.
She's cool but she makes it harder for her students in my opinion. She'll make every answer on the test a possible answer so you have to make sure you know what you're doing 1000000%. Definitely not an easy class and honestly she kind of annoyed me
Seriously awesome. Makes a class that should be extremely hard, something completely doable. Hilarious and assists you in every way possible by giving all the materials she thinks you will need to pass. I suck at math and I got an A+ on every exam. She tells you the exact format of the exam the day before so you are well prepared.
TAKE TAKE TAKE! Class is easy as long as you did the work and follow instructions. Tests are replicas of the practice test. Amazing, inspiring, and hilarious professor. Best class I've taken as UCF by far.
Dr. Janowsky was a really good professor. She was really fun and taught the material very thoroughly, and her lab attendance was optional. Tests and quizzes were pretty straight forward. Only thing to know- she does not post her full lectures online, so you must attend class to get all the notes.
Awesome professor! I was concerned taking this class (I struggle in math), bitnsje is amazing at breaking it down. Weekly live review sessions and always available to help. Shes funny and personable. Perfect choice for those good in math or those who need extra support.
This class is hard because it's stats, but she makes it not as bad and is super funny. She replies to emails super fast, and never seems bothered by students asking questions. This is a class you have to stay on top of things to do well so only take it if you're mentally ready. Mine was online so you have to be disciplined and take time out for it.
Dr. J is extremely attentive and helpful, this is my second class with her and while the subject was hard, her explanations and practice made it super easy to understand. Attending class is crucial to understanding the material and she knows that so she makes class fun each time. I wish I could take every class with her, shes that good.
Janowsky is one of the best math teachers I've ever had. I'm not a math person, but she made it click. Lectures are super easy to follow, walks you through everything, and does everything she can to prepare you for quizzes/tests. Attendance isn't mandatory, but she makes you not want to miss class. Can't say enough good things about her! Take her!
good
I love this class. Dr. Janowsky makes statistics really fun and interesting, and will literally walk the class through how to do everything. There are a lot of grades, lowest homework and lowest lab gets dropped. The practice tests are EXACTLY LIKE the actual lab quiz/test, and I recommend going to class. She's the best and is so funny too.
Wow, professor Janowsky is amazing. I hate anything to do with math but her lectures are super easy to follow, after this class I wanted a minor in stats. She's extremely witty and makes the class upbeat and fun. I would love to take her again, I can't express enough how great she is! Take her!
Although it is not mandatory to go to class, if you miss a class you will fall behind because she is constantly teaching us something new. I was very nervous to take this class but because of her, I excelled. Although there is a lot of homework, the homework is what prepares you perfectly for the exams and labs.
Make sure you read all her modules, watch her videos and read the book. Exams are 60% of final grade and the questions are not very clear. You have 60 minutes to take 50 question on each exam and she uses proctor hub. I worked very hard just to pass. I took this course for a 6 week summer course.
Prof. Janowsky was one of the best profs I've had in my undergrad experience. The outline and structure of the course couldn't have been more organized. Very amazing, very fair. You have to put the work in for this course.

Teacher comments: 
I don't regret taking him. I've never taken a physics class, but I only studied lightly for his exams and I've gotten an A and a high B. Three exams with the lowest dropped and a cumulative final. The homework is straightforward and always on Chegg. Lab is an easy A depending on the TA. If you read the textbook and do the homework its a chill class
Non-science major here. Class was titled physical science but we learned straight physics material, a nightmare as you can imagine. Super nice and willing to help outside of class. Homework roughly every class. 4 tests including final, drops lowest, my highest test score was a C+. No review format for any tests. Mandatory online textbook
Hard class for non-science people. If you get go to office hours he WILL definitely help you. I struggled a lot and went to office hours every week. My grades were definitely failing grades because I'm awful at science, but he did everything he could to help. Tons of extra credit and he gave me an amazing grade because I put the effort in. TAKE HIM
Dr. B is very intelligent. You can tell he cares about all of the students and he really does want them to succeed. People are very hard on him but it is a difficult subject. He teaches it well and if people actually paid attention and took notes, they would do fine. His lectures are a bit dry but that is due to the material. He also offers ec.
Tests are extremely hard and have nothing to do with lecture, homework, or any reviews. The textbook that he wrote does not make sense, and this class is not even physical science. This is a physics class. While Dr. B is very intelligent, he expects students to understand him as if they have the same knowledge. Unless you love physics, avoid.
This professor sometimes jumbles up his lectures and doesn't get to the actual material until the last 20 minutes. However, he wants everyone to succeed. He provides extra credit and drops an exam. Go to class, you can skip one or two lectures but he does take class participation. Also, attend the SI sessions and you will do fine on his tests.
He's funny but goes off on tangents a lot / explains concepts you do not need. The class is basically all physics with some chemistry concepts thrown in. The exams often ask about things that were not in lecture or in the book, so not easy. You need the book though and he posts lectures on youtube after class but don't skip, there's participation!
Be prepared to remember concepts and attend lectures regularly. He is honestly pretty funny but the material is harder than I expected, more like physics. The homework is easy with plenty of attempts and he is very responsive to student questions through canvas. If you are not good with concepts and SAT style exams, I don't recommend, but I did ok.
BEWARE NOT CLICKBAIT!!!!!! This physical science class is actually 100% physics. He has a PHD and does NOT know how to explain any of the material, you have to teach it to yourself. He makes you buy his textbook but nothing about it makes sense, but you have to complete reviews from it for a grade. Please dont do this to yourself dont take this!!
I advise anyone considering this class not to take it. He makes you buy a $90 textbook with no practice problems and clear grammatical errors in the writing- which he wrote himself. Lectures make no sense and you have to use an iClicker. Thinks hes funny half the time but really not, just annoying. Tests are hard and worth 80% of your grade.
Very vague and just simply doesn't teach what he puts on his tests.
Do not take this class!! I went to every lecture yet my clicker q's grade says I was not there. The lectures are pretty much impossible to follow, my notes were the most disorganized because he talks as if everyone knows physics already and would go off on tangents constantly. No formula sheet yet we have to hunt for 20+ formulas for tests
Ive never had to withdraw from a course until taking this one. Theres always a lot of homework, the final is worth 40% of your grade, the tests cover topics that have zero correlation to his lectures, &amp; he even writes the textbook himself so its hard to even teach yourself. Hes a sweet guy and everything but the rigor is ridiculous. Dont do it
Dont take this class. The lectures are hard to follow because he goes off on rants about unrelated topics like every 5 minutes. The homework isnt much better because he tries too hard to be relatable instead of understandable and loads the questions with unnecessary nonsense. If perpetual confusion is your thing then go for it.
He gives opportunity for bonus points, and drops 1 out of 3 midterms. Lectures are posted online but its best to go to class for participation points. What he talks about in class is what he tests you on. He doesn't try to trick you on exam. He can be a little feisty, but it seems like he means no harm and wants you to succeed.
I took Dr. B for Physics 2 in 6 weeks for summer B. Although the class was fast paced I enjoyed taking the class and it was very doable. He was very understanding that the class was a summer class and he did not make our exams ridiculously hard. He gave us MANY bonus point opportunities. He may seem mean but if you talk to him after class he's nice
I took him during summer B. The class was 6 weeks and there were hiccups. He sometimes treated staff poorly and would loose his temper over small things. Overall I stayed out of his way and spoke to him after class. If you attend class and do well on HW and lab it would be hard to fail the class. Good amount of extra credit and good grading scale.
Took him for the 6 week Physics 2 course and I honestly enjoyed him, he's not as bad as people say. By just coming to class I was able to learn so much, not many professors actually teach they normally just read off powerpoints. Also he gives a good amount of extra credit. Overall its hard to fail this class, unless you just put 0 effort.
Professor Brueckner is honestly the most disrespectful professor I've ever had at UCF. He makes a difficult class even harder by being disorganized, rude, and disrespectful to everyone that comes in contact with him. He refuses to answer questions from students and you can tell he does not care if you pass or fail. Borderline harassment.
The rudest and nastiest professor I ever had. He insults students and gets away with it because ucf would never get rid of him. Yes you may pass his class but look forward to mental abuse.

Really nice guy overall. The grading is a little tough but getting an A is possible if you study for the exams. Watch the lectures. Also study the study cube guide and practice exams a few days before taking the exam and you should do well.
He's a super nice professor. I think most people are just frustrated over the course work. But as far as professors go, he's an excellent one. He answers emails, which is something that cant be said for many of UCFs teachers. He is very nice and tries to make class interesting. The class is kind of pointless but I dont feel like thats his fault.
It was an easy class to attend and pay attention to and do the fun activities. The hardest part is the videos you have to watch and learn because the test get very specific on these videos and they can be a tad boring.
Professor Cleavenger is a fair professor that indeed will make you work for it but the material is not complicated. The tests are straight from the study guide and a few questions from his video lectures. He is also quite hilarious and cultivating. The people who critique him are the ones who dont take the extra steps to pass.
Thought this class was going to be an easy A, but he really makes you work for it. Study for the tests. Final is comprehensive but he drops your lowest test grade so keep that in mind during the semester.
You get the grade you deserve in this class. Strict on grading, no leeway. Good guy, kind of a BS class.
You would think that this class would be extremely easy, but it isn't. Cleavenger makes everything very complicated, especially his exams. Make sure that you watch his lecture videos that are in the textbook that he wrote and take very detailed notes on them, they will make up the majority of the exam questions. 0/10 recommend.
A class that should be easy is made more difficult with this professor. He changed the grading scale to a 93% with no extra credit, the quizzes being worth 4 points and test worth 200. Your test scores have to be basically perfect to get an "A" in this class.
This class is okay, felt more like a psychology class. The professor has lectures and attendance is mandatory. The chapters are a bit long but the quizzes for each are pretty easy. Exams were a bit confusing because of the wording.
While the material isn't hard to learn, it's very difficult to get the A. You need a 93% in the class or a 91% average across four exams with the quizzes/in-class sessions perfect to get the A. The tests also have video questions that hardly correlate to the material on the exam. Be sure to take notes on every little detail.
Would rather get ran over than have to take this mans class, literally. His way of "teaching" is rather unproductive/useless as the 5 mandatory meetings per semester consists of sitting in a class room listening to him talk... about what you may ask? Well I couldn't tell you cause he's boring and I couldn't retain one piece of info. Tests are hard
Good class. Pay attention to the stories he tells in lectures. Study cube helps a lot too.
Cleavenger is a really nice guy and is understand. Yeah the new reduced seating format sucks, but his class is more about learning and understanding concepts, so its not to bad in this format. Just know and understand the vocab and watch his videos and you'll do good.
In a class that should be extremely easy, Cleavenger manages to over complicate things by telling mundane stories and asking questions on the exams that were a tangent of a tangent that he expects you to connect to a topic all on your own. Essentially, just be prepared to teach yourself and hear some stories.
So here's the breakdown, Professor Cleavenger has his own textbook that he makes you purchase and you need this book. All the quizzes are only accessible through the book's website. You need to watch the lectures as well because test material comes from lectures and the book. It's pretty easy if you keep up with it, just wasn't a fan of his style.
Dr. Clevanger is a good professor. He tells his life's story and try to connect with managment class. He ask lecture questions in the exam, so you have to watch his lectures and take some brife notes. This summer semester was last semster for lecture cepture classes, so i am guessing, i wouldnt be as hard as it was.
He's a really great professor. However, he doesn't teach like any other professor. In fact, he just tells stories the whole class which you have to pay attention to because 15-20% of his tests are based on those stories. You have to read all the chapters and then create a quizlet of all the terms b/c his tests are 98% vocab. Put in effort for an A.
Prof Cleavenger is an overall nice guy who cares about his students and loves his job. He tells way too many stories in class and often gets very off topic but he means well. Watching lectures is a must because 15-20% of each test is lecture specific questions.
OK class overall. You can get an A fairly easy if you study a lot. Make sure to pay attention to his stories... about 20% of the exams come from them. get studycube too.
the class it self its easy, he is very fun and keep you entertain, But you DO have to study, you have to read the boo and concepts other wise you will not pass the class. the material its easy to learn so its not that much.

After the first 3 classes I stopped going, professor was confusing and often got off topic. Read the book before doing the practices and you should be fine. Did it completely online, never went to class, ended up with an A. Lets you use a notecard on exams.
amazing teacher. This is not an easy class, therefore you have to study and put in the time for it. Go to the TA, he is so helpful! I read the chapters and went to the TA's office for help, highly suggested. The only reason i didn't get a A in the class is because i slacked off on the last exam

I read the chapters and went to the TA's office for help, highly suggested. The only reason i didn't get a A in the class is because i slacked off on the last exam, but easy class to get a B.
Took this course as a lecture capture. Got a B barely. Not an easy course. All the extra credit saved me.. practice exams make a big difference, do those. Class is pretty boring.
Class is boring. But she's willing to help if needed. Tests are hard, but class is mandatory so you just have to get through it.
I received a B in the class because the homework assignments and extra credit are what kept my grade alive. The exams are difficult but similar to the practice tests. DO THE HOMEWORK and EXTRA CREDIT!!!
She is not a bad professor but then again I'm not a professor trying to teach Macro (hard class to begin with) to a bunch of half asleep students. If you can take someone better, do it. If she is one of the only ones, take her.
Macro is a hard class for me but this professor makes it manageable for anyone dreading this class. There is homework that is due, however she will drop the two lowest HW grades as well as the lowest Test score so there is a bit of a cushion. I do recommend her :)
I took her for Macroeconomics and I took her online. She was boring to watch her lectures but they are extremely helpful when doing Aplia (the homework) and as long as you do her practice exams you will pass the exams. She is also extremely nice and helpful.
I took this class as the lecture/live view online and chose to just watch it online. Macro is hard, not going to lie. Unless you're good at it, it will come somewhat easy to you, but you do have to work hard. Aplia (homework) is annoying but a little helpful. Study her power points for the test and practice!
Definitely not an easy A unless you are good with macro. She is  a good teacher but if you tend to get behind in your work then this might be a class to avoid, she moves quickly.
She tries to relate to her students with examples often. Not a bad teacher but sometimes I feel like she is just reading the power points. Take her though, overall good quality!
Prof. E is a sweet woman. While her class is not easy by any means, she is understanding and tries to offer as much extra credit as possible. Everything is mandatory from the book to hw except for attendance. Do all the hw, do well on exams and watch the lectures and you'll be fine.
Such a nice, sweet lady! She really tries to make sure students understand everything being covered in class. The work load is relatively light, but you will have to study alot for the exams to pass. Class is relatively easy if you put in the time !
This was an online class and I went to the available lectures because the website was always down. She is a good professor but her concepts are very hard to understand without having taken AP macro. STUDY A LOT. pay attention and do the homework. you can get at least a B if you try.
If you go into this class thinking it will be easy because you aced Econ in high school, think again. The lessons are difficult for a GEP class, and at the end of the semester I was fighting to earn my B. Euzent herself isn't a bad teacher, but her subject is very dull. FYI: before taking ANY exam, make sure you can ace the online practice exams.
This course was definitely NOT easy. The aplia hw wasn't too bad after watching the lectures but the exams killed my grade. I read the book after the first exam but didn't help. How well you do depends on your interest level. If you aren't a business major &amp; have an option to take another course for the GenEd requirement then go for something else.
Great teacher. Take her class!
Very nice and sincere professor, but her lectures are monotonous. She provides everything online, so spare yourself going to class if you're good at self-teaching. I went to 2 classes the whole semester, read the textbook, and ended up with an A final grade. Aplia is tedious, but complete everything and do the extra credit and you will be fine.
She really enjoys teaching Economics. She was a good teacher but economics is extremely hard. I struggled on the exams but still had a decent grade. If you do the aplia and extra credit you can make a good grade. Tests are kind of tough, you have to study for them.
Teacher name: Cooney, James
School name: University of Central Florida
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Your grade is based on tests and hw/quizzes from the textbook. Its on a different website and Canvas wont notify you when assignments are due. There is extra credit if you go to the observatory. Cooney is passionate about the content &amp; his sarcasm/humor is much appreciated. I was stressed the entire semester then he curved our grades by 5-10%.
I'm really bad at STEM classes, so subject wise I kind of struggled. But Dr. Cooney is genuinely hilarious, and makes his powerpoint slides very easy to follow and take notes on. When I take the tests all of the questions are clearly from things we talked about / learned in class (don't skip class). As long as you study you should be fine.
I can tell he is a knowledgeable individual, but his teaching skills are poor. The class is also very difficult for a GEP course. The one thing that really bothered me was that he makes all the students buy a $40 iclicker to answer questions in class. Its 2019, there are so many apps you can use for free to text in answers.
A great person, extremely intelligent, and very knowledgable about Astronomy however, this class was a disaster for more than just me. While his passion about the topic was evident, it often didn't translate into his teaching or just took away from it all together. Test? Read/study the textbook more than lectures.
He sounds just like Weird Al.
This class was super difficult for many people in my class. Class avg on every test was roughly a 50-60%. Not a single person ever got a 100% on any test given. I had difficulty studying due to the information being extensive and hard to understand. A 5-10% curve is given, and we could use a 3x5 written notecard on tests. Challenging class.
Really nice and smart on the subject of astronomy, but tests were very difficult. I never felt confident leaving after an exam. Curve will help you pass in the end.
Prof. Cooney obviously is very passionate about astronomy, but he's just not good at teaching those who aren't as knowledgable as he is. The tests are pretty difficult and you basically have to teach yourself via the textbook if you wanna understand anything. The curve at the end of the semester is the only thing that saved me from failing.
Dont buy physical book because it comes with the MyLabs assignment. He tends get too wrapped up in the subject that he wont actually go in full detail for exam based questions. He has extra credit for 1% only. Nonetheless, hes friendly, understanding, but youll be better of using the homework help on MyLabs and teaching yourself. Curves too!
I was able to read every chapter and study for each test. I got a B or C on each test but ended up with an A because he does a huge curve at the end. Attendance also helps a ton. I'm terrible with anything math/science related and I was still able to get an A. Still a better choice than chem or physics. If you have the time to study, take it.
Cooney was one of those professors that if you read the textbook and understood you will be fine. He tries to explain concepts but ends up making lectures brief and convoluted. I guarantee if you do not take the effort to study in this class you will not pass. But on the upside he curves a lot. He's even curving around 10% this semester.
Professor Cooney is very funny and personable. I enjoyed going to class and listening to the lectures. Tests are hard if you don't study. Fill out the study guide and read over the textbook to get good grades. He's very helpful because he curves grades and drops one test. He has clicker questions in class for credit, so keep that in mind as well!
I do not recommend him. His tests are very different than what we do in class and for homework. Even the practice exam doesn't help much. His test averages are usually in the 50%-60% percent range so he relies on curves to pass most of the class rather than simply making the tests more similar to the work we usually do and the same difficulty.
In the end his curve is what saves people, but you have to work your butt off for anything higher than a C. I easily spent 10 or more hours EVERY week doing extra problems in the book for practice just to get a D on exams. I got a 79 in the end and I was in the top 15% of the class so I got an A. While attendance isnt mandatory, its a life saver.
I mean he's not the best professor but he gets a bad rap on here. I did not take physics before and it wasnt as bad as people make it out to be. Definitely more self-taught than I would prefer but if you read the textbook and dont look up the hw answers you'll pass fine. As a person he's really nice and funny! Just study hard and you'll be fine!
If you're great with teaching yourself a lot of material then take this class-if you learn based off of examples, lectures and tutoring then dont take this scale up version. A lot was up in the air and it was a difficult class (class averages were all F's when I took it) now I have to retake it.
Cooney was a good person and gave helpful explanations one-on-one but he was not a good teacher. He did very few detailed explanations of problems/concepts in class and left you to figure out most things yourself. This made the tests very difficult. However, there was a decent curve at the end of the class. Tests averages were between 40 and 50.
Dr. Cooney is a great person, and really tries to makes physics seem more appealing. However, I never felt very prepared from lectures. Tests are much harder than they should be, but he does curve quite generously. My semester had 2 tests instead of 3, which made things a bit harder, but you're gonna need to put in lots of effort to succeed.
Don't take unless you've taken diff eq &amp; physics III, you should be well versed in physics &amp; math. Tests are hard, HW harder. Cooney finds the bare minimum effort he can put into teaching and gives just a little less help than that. No powerpoints, no notes, barely any feedback, no hints on what exams will be like. Not worth it.
While I definitely think its great that Dr. Coomey is passionate and knowledgable about all things space, he definitely expects way too much from a gen ed class. This class was insanely difficult to understand and was full of ambiguous ideas and theories. You use MasteringAstronomy to take weekly quizzes online and his tests are INSANELY HARD.
Teacher name: Vajravelu, Rani
School name: University of Central Florida
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
The Professor provides you with all the materials you need. Her given notes are outlines, but as long as you attend lecture, it is easily filled in because that same information is in full on the slides she shows in class. Her grading is only through exams, but she gives a study guide that tells you pretty much everything you should know to pass.
I took her fall 2018 and I wouldn't take her again because the tests. The class content was really interesting, but tests were like botched games of bar trivia. She writes the textbook so pay attention to it, she may sneak some of it onto the tests. She can also be a little passive aggressive about how the class did on tests, but lots of kids skip.
I was so nervous for this class but you just have to literally study the study guide and utilize the end of chapter practice problems/ the practice quizzes she gives through web courses for extra credit. No surprises ever, so easy to do well if you study.
Dr. Rani wants all of her students to pass and she gives lots of opportunities for extra credit. If you go to class, do the extra credit quizzes, and do the self-quizzes in the textbook you will be good. Her tests are straight forward, and she rounds grades! As long as you put in the work this is an easily passable class.
At first my grades weren't so good and I almost didn't pass. She might give an extra credit opportunity if you ar right on th ecusp of not passing. SHe has great TA's that can also help, and knows how to explain the criteria to her class. Her pop tests and quizzes in class will save your grade so make sure to always study and go to class.
She wants her students to do well but does not set them up for success. Her notes are confusing and unorganized. Your grade is based solely off exams and the exams are very detailed. Questions appear on her test that she never went over... The textbook is written by her so it will be your best resource. She makes simple concepts very confusing.
She lies about what will be on each exam and how in depth we need to know each topic. If you don't have her book, you will fail. She tests on very small details mentioned in class and will occasionally test on material outside of the chapters she said to study. She does however offer a lot of extra credit in the form of quizzes which is nice.
You have to show up to her lectures because unless your a biology genius you're going to fail. She posts a general outline of the notes on webcourses but you have to go to class to get the full information. In order to pass the test you have to study very hard from her notes. She has an accent which makes it even more difficult to understand her.
DO NOT miss class! If you do miss class, make sure you READ the textbook; ALWAYS read the textbook. There will be material during the lecture that she covers in broad details, but the textbook covers more in-depth and those questions will somehow pop up on the exams. MAKE A QUIZLET for every chapter she covers!
Exams cover every small details but very straight forward, online quizzes are trickier than the exams. Her accent is not too bad, has some extra credit points, test material comes from powerpoint and textbook. Class is not as bad as reviews make it seem. Quizlet is probably best for this class.
Dr. Rani is a great professor. I just took her class to fulfill a GEP credit but her class really got me interested in the subject. As long as you study hard for the exams you should do just fine.
Need to memorize anything and everything. Questions on tests are hard and obscure. If you ask her a question she just says, "I said it in lecture". She wrote the book herself yet it is outdated and inaccurate. When you mention that to her she just repeats about lecture. Had a solid B until the final, but once again she threw a curve ball.
You literally need to know every itty bitty detail for her exams. She's also extremely rude and not helpful at all during office hours. If you have a question, check your notes and her textbook (that's what she'll tell you). Some of the exam and homework questions contradict the textbook that SHE WROTE. In simple terms, this class is awful.
Gives attendance quizzes 4 lectures that are hard 2 follow 4 notes that you can only get if you a present, that are disorganized and do not match the textbook that she effin wrote. Her reviews for the tests are not reviews they are reminders saying "know everything." Her tests have trick questions so you actually do need to know everything.
Her thick accent is extremely hard to understand. her tests sometimes make no sense with the study material. She is ill tempered and extremely rude. Do not take this class unless you are prepared to spend 4 hours a day studying.
So you have to sit through a boring lecture and memorize all the plant names and info in time for the test. If that sounds appealing then go for it. I suggest you dont.
Her lectures were very in-depth so I'd recommend going to class every day and taking those notes, you need to study to pass unless you're great at bio. We mostly did tests with the occasional pop quiz and she does offer extra credit that she adds up at the end.
This class honestly stressed me out way too bad. Theres only four tests including the final but your lowest score is dropped. A good chunk of extra credit is given. If you do bad on more than one test youre screwed for the class so you HAVE TO STUDY. The textbook is needed, random information from the book is pulled out for tests.
This is supposed to be biology for non-majors and unfortunately, Rani makes the course needlessly difficult. I personally can't attest to the second test but the third and the final exam were insanely hard and the textbook is pretty unhelpful. Take someone else ESPECIALLY if you're a CSD major. Props to adjusting the course after Irma, though.
Only 4 exams that make up your entire grade. I recommend studying A LOT because the tests aren't easy. She gives extra credit which is nice but not too much. You can only get the extra credit by going to class and taking optional quizzes!
Teacher name: Montgomery, Michele
School name: University of Central Florida
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She is very nice, but her lectures are very long and they contradict what is said in the text book. Everything was very easy to find on google, the class is not hard. You have 5 exams and she drops the lowest one, but you have pre quizzes and quizzes due before every exam, there were over ten for each exam. She does offer a ton of extra credit
Definitely not a professor I would take again. Her lectures were really hard to understand. She would use abbreviations for everything in her PowerPoints and would never clarify what half of them even meant. She asks questions on her tests that she never even mentions in class. Best advice: use Quizlet.
Take this course!! all of the course assignments are online through the masteringastronomy portal just copy and paste every question into google and you will find all the quizlets!!! you also get 48 hours to complete exams. do not need to purchase textbook because you can just get all answers from google, easy A.
DO NOT TAKE HER!! This class has been a nightmare. She literally doesnt care. She tells you to contact her if theres an issue but then she turns everything around on you and doesnt help AT ALL. She doesnt care if the required website glitches or has errors. She refuses to adjust grades or work with you. Tests are impossibly hard. RUN!!!
The lectures are so hard to sit through. There is also a tutorial AND quiz for every chapter with pop quizzes throughout. I definitely suggest reading the textbook and looking for quizlets to study because that's the only way to actually understand anything. I wouldn't go to class if there weren't pop quizzes.
Out of every gen ed I've taken at UCF, this was by far the most stressful and most difficult. Dr. Montgomery covers material very broadly that you will be expected to know for tests. While quizlet is available for help on some questions, it isn't for the majority and they are always the hardest questions. She's also really standoffish and rude
Big difference between what is said in lecture and textbook, although lecture will have pop quizzes. Chapter quizzes and exams are full of weird trick questions, chapter quizzes not related to chapter. Astronomy is interesting, but tests are way hard. I would not recommend this professor.
Though I love stellar astro, this is the worst class &amp; worst professor I've ever had. Half the things taught in this class were incorrect, grading is biased, the amount of material covered is ridiculous, and the amount of work given is crazy. On the bright side, her terrible teaching job has inspired me to teach this class properly in the future.
She does care for her students in her own way. But for the most part her lectures are boring, she gives too many pop quizzes so if you miss a class you most likely will miss a 15 point quiz. She gives 5 tests. 4 exams and 1 final. She drops the lowest of the 5. Overall she tries her best but the class is way to big
She will nitpick you for every little error you make no matter how small. What normally would not be difficult is made difficult by her high standards. Made a comment on my paper that I should see a tutor because I made a simple mistake. She will say she can't read your handwriting but hers is illegible.
Worst professor at UCF by far. The class was not hard but she made it hard because she is such a terrible professor, I did finish with an A in the class though.
Her discussions are so specific and detailed, very unnecessary and has nothing to do with actually learning astronomy. Makes you take a picture of your signature and upload it to prove its your online work, didn't learn anything all semester.
Really snarky and rude, even in emails. Frequent changes to the syllabus in the middle of the semester. Seems to ignore discussion boards for the most part. Wouldn't recommend for a science GEP credit.
ONLINE ONLY CLASS Communication thru WebCourses/Canvas is very poor/unresponsive and is demeaning. Quizzes on every chapter. Some quizzes allow multiple attempts but she will only count the first attempt. But she plays "dumb" and says the system doesn't allow it. 3 Exams plus a cumulative Final. Thankfully no papers or group projects. Quizlet.
Worst class I've taken so far.  I found the class itself pretty easy, I got an A, but she is so boring and just a horrible horrible lecturer.  She does give pop quizzes so go to class.  I learned nothing the whole semester.
I think Professor Montgomery was a good professor. She is a tough grader on discussions; however, you have more than enough time to make your discussions perfect (about 3 weeks). Exams and quizzes are challenging so if you want to pass you need to go through her power points and really study not just skim the chapters.
Beware of the tests. They are, for the most part, more detailed and extensive than the lectures or the textbook. Also show up to class because she will give pop-quizzes on the fly. Tests and "homework" quizzes (not the pop quizzes) are all online, which I think is a good thing but everyone has their preferences.
I took astronomy because I suck at science. She just rambles during her lectures, and although attendance isn't graded, she does have pop quizzes every few weeks. There were 4 exams,  and a bunch of quizzes before each exam. Many answers can be found online, but then she would have questions 'from class.' Most of those questions she never mentioned
Whatever you do don't take this professor. She is one of the worst I have ever had and doesn't care about the students what so ever. Her lectures are somewhat helpful but there is so much information and she does not give a clear study guide for what will be on the test. Pick anyone else if you need this class. 0/5
I found her to be one of the worst teachers I have ever had, I initially tried to pay attention but she moved way to quickly and went off on crazy tangents. Tests almost never made any sense based off of her lectures but the book helped me pass. If you want to actually learn don't take her but if you want to just fulfill gep with a C or low B do it

Teacher comments: 
Dr. Massiah is such an amazing professor and human. She has a passion for teaching and will go out of her way for her students. She provides study guides which are exactly like the exam. She gives at least 2 extra credit opportunities in the semester. Her lectures are funny and entertaining. Important to watch the lectures online prior to exam.
Dr. Massiah is the best professor I've ever had. She brings so much energy to her lecture and is so passionate about marketing. Shes extremely interesting to listen to and I always enjoy her lectures. Tests are half multiple choice and half written responses. The marketing sim you do in class is really cool and an easy grade.
Ended the class one point away from an A but wouldn't bump it up. You are able to skip one of the tests and make it up the week before finals which was a blessing. Gives a good amount of extra credit. Also took this class as a reduced seat time class.. there's no way around that, it sucks but Massiah makes it tolerable w her online lecture videos.
Great caring professor. She is so sweet and she sets you up for success. Gives a lot of extra credit. If you miss class for a legitimate reason she awards you the points. loved her video lectures also. Exams cover what is in the videos and book.
I was not a fan of the Reduced Seating Classroom set, however Dr. Massiah was EXTREMELY helpful to her students. Her course is well organized and she is genuinely caring for her hundreds of students. This does not mean you can slack in the course and get an easy A. Her due dates are more than fair and her exams have concrete Exam Reviews.
She makes the class enjoyable. The only difficulty is the amount of homework, but there is ample time to complete it. Even in the REAL format she makes the class easy. The in-class assignments aren't the best, but in the long run don't affect your grade. If you pay attention you'll do fine, for a lot of my classmates that was too much to ask.
She's an amazing professor, very organized, understanding, and wants her students to succeed. You have assignments due weekly and five exams. You need a 93% to get an A, but she has many extra credit opportunities. Do your work on time, study for the exams and an A is very doable. Wish I could take her again.
Dr. Massiah is hands down the best professor Ive had at UCF. I have so much respect for her as a professor and a human - she cares so much about marketing and her students and she makes everyone feel welcome in her class. She has certainly left her mark on my college experience and I would take this class 100 times over if I could.
This class isn't so bad.. But I would recommend for those who want to make an A to not take this class over the summer...
Great Professor! Amazing lectures. Homework is easy and doesn't take long to do, tests are very similar to practice tests she provides.
Easy class, pretty straight forward exams as long as you do your LearnSmart study materials properly! Be careful about not doing homework assignments because they will bring your grade down significantly if you fail to do some! Overall a ver kind and understanding woman who is VERY passionate about Marketing!
This class was so simple and easy. The book helps a lot for exams, but use LearnSmart to study! Her tests are easy if you study hard, but can be hard if you are not well prepared. Classes were fine, sometimes she just uses the time to promote different organizations which was a waste but overall a good easy class.
one of the best 100%. I would defiantly take it again. so much respect for this women.
This professor know how to teach class, she makes lecture very interesting. she gives out lots of extra credits. There's should not be a problem getting A in this class. very respected professor class.
Lets just say I wish Dr. Massiah taught all of my classes. Shes an absolutely amazing teacher and human. Im very sad I wont be taking another class with her because Im an Accounting major. There is plenty of opportunity for extra credit, do the homework, use the test study guides she gives you, and its an easy A.
Massiah is an amazing professor. There are 5 tests, all multiple choice and each one has extra credit on it. Watch her lectures, read the book, do the homework/quizzes, and do the practice exam over and over until you understand. She gives TONS of extra credit, probably because a 93+ is an A, but it is possible to get with a little bit of effort.
Dr. Massiah is one of those professors that is truly special because she is so enthusiastic about her own material. She genuinely loves marketing and it makes her class that much easier. The 5 tests are nothing if you watch the lectures and there's even extra credit if you need it. If you have the chance, absolutely take her!
Massiah's great! It takes a lot to keep a class invested when 90% of them are watching you at home in their jammies, but she does it. You don't really need to read the book but you do have to buy it for homework assignments. Assignments are easy but frequent. Tests are deceptively difficult, and there are a lot of them.
In short, Dr. Massiah is one of the best professors I've ever taken. She genuinely cares about her students and is incredibly supportive. She tends to give inspirational speeches and periodic "real talks" in class. Her class is also not hard and her lectures are absolutely worth going to in person.
Professor was fair with exams. Read the text book, complete all assignments, do the practice exams over and over, watch the lectures for bonus questions and you will pass.

Overall not a bad experience. Would recommend taking the course if you actually want to learn something.
Prof Moore is awesome! I don't understand the negative comments. She teaches very well with lots of examples and I always got A's and B's on the test (never read the book). There is a lot of extra credit. Prof is very nice and willing to help if you ask her a question. I think she is a great economics teacher and I do recommend her. Watch lectures!
If you want to learn about microeconomics do not take this professor! She is terrible. She is always confused, doesn’t explain things well and could not use technology. Hands down the worst professor I've had at UCF.  The only saving grace is that it is easy to pass the class, thanks to extra credit and simple homework.
Took the lecture capture version of this course for Summer A. Elder lady, super nice, gives extra credit, homework is easy and helps to understand concepts, don't have to use the book too much because she talks about everything in the powerpoint thats on the test. Make a good notecard with the graphs and key terms, and side notes you have. Easy A.
Class is not mandatory but I recommend going because she does go over test questions. Sometimes she can get confusing when explaining certain things but its not that bad, just check the textbook. If you make a detailed notecard for each test and all of the HW then you can easily get an A. If you do all the work and extra credit you'll be fine.
Terrible at teaching but she makes the class very easy. I only attended the first 2 classes because attendance is useless for learning. Two things to get an A, MAKE A GREAT NOTECARD FOR THE TEST and do the homework. The only reason I didn't get an A is because I ended with an F in the HW category (HW is stupid easy I'm just an idiot for missing it)
Does not explain topics clear enough so you can understand it. She will talk about how great she is and how much she knows about economics but fails to explain it. Do yourself a favor and do not take her.
Despite flaunting her economic prowess, she fails to provide any wisdom to the class, leaving students lost and confused. I attended class every day before the first the test and got a C. Afterward, I didn't go to class once. I got an A on the rest. Not only did she not help me, her unrelated rambles about JCPenney actively kept me from learning.
If you want to be confused about economics then I recommend taking this baffle minded teacher. All she does during class is talk about how she mixes up the material and then gets an attitude when a student doesn't understand. I got a 98 in micro in highschool and ended up with a D in college because of her. I regret ever taking this class!
Worst teacher I've ever experienced, she cannot teach. I've tried to sit in class and learn, but the fact that all she does is read directly off her power points and talks to herself, rather than the class, makes it impossible. She gives EC assignments because if she didn't everyone would fail. The only help i got for tests was the book. RUN!!!
This is the worst teacher I have ever had, her lectures make no sense and she reads as though she is a machine. She does not care about her students as I ended the class with a 79.4% and would not even come to meet with me to go over the finale nor bump me .6%. Going to her office hours is useless because she  is clueless &amp; and admits to it.
Probably the worst teacher to ever walk the face of the earth. Ended the class with a 79.8% and she refused to bump up my grade. Everything about her lectures is confusing and you can benefit greatly from avoiding this class AT ALL COSTS.
Worst professor ive ever had. Do not take her. Shes sweet but simply cannot teach. Please take my advice is go to a different economics teacher.
I don't know how she is still employed here at ucf, she rambles, can't admit to her own mistakes even when students correct her, spends at least half of each class talking about her most recent grocery store trip and then proceeds to give impossible exams that leave kids baffled after they take them. AVOID HER
She is not helpful at all. I would go to class thinking she would be more clear the next time, but it never ended up that way. I depended on MyEcon Labs and the extra credit, which is not a large portion of the grade. All she does is ramble and mix up all of the formulas. I tried my best to understand. My grade suffered because she is not clear.
If you can take another professor do so!she is very sweet but she can't clarify very well n even going into office hours she was of very little help to me even when i brought in specific questions.She look at me like i was stupid! If you do end up sticking with her buy the book n do ALL EC! the EC isnt hard. HAD USE THE HELP DESK to even get a 70%
I did not enjoy this class. She always had to correct herself and would write down things on the overhead and say the opposite out loud. I also got tired of hearing the same stories about how she is a thrifty shopper over and over again. Sorry but I did not like this class. I got an A but you have to teach yourself.
this class isnt hard. She makes it harder due to her lack of explanation. If you take the book and study and ready its relatively easy.
She was absolutely useless. She was horrible at teaching and gave the wrong information a lot of the time. I eventually stopped going to class and used the summaries in the book to prepare for tests. I got a B+, but would have been better if she wasn't such a horrible professor. Take another professor if you can.
If I could give her less than one, I would. I basically memorized the whole textbook and still got a bad grade. She sucks at teaching and even her tests have typos.

Teacher comments: 
Brilliant. #1
Winner who now teaches for 2018 National Football Championship's winners.
I never thought that Johnny Depp would be the best lecturer ever.
Dr. Johnson is extremely personable/hilarious. He is extremely knowledgeable (and is very aware of his intelligence). If you take him you MUST go to class. Tests are based off the lectures and the book notes. He does not assign homework so you must do well on tests. He hands out easy bonus points. Overall, he's a great guy and a great teacher.
Professor Johnson is  remarkable. He is a genius and he is funny. But he is not easy and you should study hard. He helped a lot of students after class. He is nice.
The classic prof and a very good high level phil  class.  His lectures were my favorite. Would retake.
He is a awesome religion teacher. A lot of the focus is on religious beliefs.
He is  great teacher, but a little on the tough side. Maybe if backed off on Kant and Hegel! Love his style and method. Good prof.
He is a phenomenal teacher. He is very intelligent and very handsome. He is the best.
Trig is a professor who loves the sound of his own voice. If you share his opinions, he will grade you high but I didn't feel there was much room for different views than his own. He's hot but knows it.
Took his class, becuase he is so popular. Grades were mostly tests with papers and bonus. It was a challenging class sometimes but not crazy hard.  Probably will not need the book that much. He is a great speaker and fascinating to listen to. He should star in the movies, if he ever stops teaching.
He  is a great aesthetics teacher!
He is a Professor who really cares about his students and really wants everyone to get into philosophy. Lectures are long but Professor Johnson's lectures are interseting. Be sure to take notes and study those. He tends to get upset when the class isn't reading and doing their homework.
Take him if you can get into his class.   You will love his lectures and having your mind blown. Like a lot of people say, there is no  teacher who teaches like him. His class is an experience. and Trig  is like some profound force of nature. He stimulates you.
Took him for an upper-level aesthetics class "Philosophy and Creativity". He was great. Very in touch with philosophy, art and culture.
This guy is a GREAT philosophy teacher. Close attention and you will be fine. Slack, and it will probably hurt.
Maybe a litle hard, but he is definitely worth it. Knows his aesthetics! VERY creative thinker and almost always has a smile on his face. Nice guy and very funny.
Legit. Love his lectures and respect that he  does not give into grade inflation for his popularity, high ratings, etc.  But you do have to work because he doesn't cave and his class is not for slackers.
Great professor, great personality, great vibe.  Reminds me a lot of Richard Feynman! Class is not hard if you always focus. Definitely recommend.
The professor was awesome I enjoyed his class. Trig lived up to his rep as a genius with a 170 I.Q. This man is a phenomenal teacher. He is gorgeous too like I expected since he is rated the hottest prof at UCF. Ok, beauty and brains for days! BUT maybe he could make the class easier? I studied SO hard for a B! For an intro class! :'(
Teacher name: Scrogin, David
School name: University of Central Florida
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Honestly, the best professor ever. No professor cares more, or teaches as well. He expects work to be put into the class but if you do it and really take the time to understand it the class is very easy and rewarding, especially learning STATA. He is very accessible for questions and always helpful. Very much recommenced Econometrics with him.
I took Honors Microeconomics with him. He's very nice and will go out of his way to help every student! The class is very difficult, but at the end of the day, he drops 2 quizzes &amp; a test which helps your grade. Even though it's hard, I learned the content extremely well. He engages students a lot throughout the class which makes class interesting.
THIS WAS THE HARDEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN! I didn't get higher than a c on any of the tests and trust me, I definitely studied for them. I was so afraid I was going to fail. He's a cool teacher though. The way the class is (half online, half in class) was horrible. MY ADVICE: read the text book and really focus on the problem sets. STUDY!
Scrogin is a good professor. the new course format is not very good at all though. Got an A so can't complain too much. StudyCube helped a lot too.
The professor is more helpful than the TA. Well at least one of them. But I didnt like the format which was reduce seating, where we see the professor 5 times out of the semester . Had 6 quizzes drops 2 3 midterms drops 1 and a cumulative final.  Economics is a hard subject but I pass thanks for the extra points and dropping of the lowest grades.
He's a great professor, who's put in a pretty bad situation with the new class format. It does make things pretty difficult where everything is being done online, especially if you aren't a good online learner. A good grade is possible, you just need to work for it. If I didn't have all of the extra credit I would've gotten a really low C.
Scrogin is awesome, super funny and nice, but the format of this class is truly horrible (not his fault). You meet 5 times, quizzes are online, exams taken in the testing center. Lots of chances to improve your grade, lowest exam and 2 quizzes dropped. The material was pretty boring for me, but gets better if you put in the work.
Scrogin is a super nice and passionate professor, however the reduced seat time format is not great. There is not a lot of structure, and you have to basically teach yourself all the material. I was in the first section to have the new format, so hopefully it's set up better in the future. Doesn't curve, but drops lowest 2 quizzes and exam.
Don't buy the textbook he posts the slideshows of what you need for free. He is an amazing economics teacher so if you like economics- highly recommend him but he is not the easiest to understand if you don't like economics. Tests aren't terrible just work through previous quizzes.
Majority of the questions on the tests are from him quizzes and his provided problem sets. You can find the answers for basically all quiz questions on quizlet. It'll help to understand the information first and then memorize the quiz questions. I thought this class was a breeze. you basically get all the test answers.
He's a very nice guy but the material can be rather confusing at times. To get very good grades on tests, you have to start studying the material weeks in advance so you know the concepts. Despite this, many test questions come from quiz questions/problem sets. Drops lowest test grade and two lowest quiz grades.
Quizlet is the way to go. Decent and fair professor.
no homework so there's not a lot to buffer your grade if you're not good with tests or have a tough time understanding the material. There are like 3 lectures and the test formats are god awful to understand. I'm not very good with math or understanding word problems but I'm not a total idiot I've made it to the end of college and this is hard af
I took this class with lecture capture. The material was difficult but he explains concepts pretty well. The textbook is helpful if you struggle with economics. When I took him he assigned no homework, but there were activities posted every week that were optional. He posts good study guides and notes so there's plenty to use to study for exams
Take this class if you're just looking for an easy A. I'm an Economics major and found this class very frustrating. If you actually want or NEED to learn this material, Scrogin will not teach it to you. He is very repetitive and includes 10% extra credit built into your grade so that every kid can pass. Easy A, but you will learn nothing.
amazing at describing and elaborating
Scrogin is great, super nice guy and cared about his students (it was a 1500 student class). Quizzes every week to every other week. I am horrible at econ and passed with a B! Quizlet is your best friend for this. He lets you use a 3x5 notecard for the exams too which literally saved me from not failing. Online lectures, didn't even watched them
Most of the quizzes are on quizlet, exams are pretty much exactly like the quizzes, he dropped two quiz grades and the lowest exam (not including final exam). I didn't watch a single lecture since August and I got a B! He also had built in extra credit in all of the exams and quizzes, adds up to 10% to your final grade if I'm not mistaken!
After the final, be prepared to receive 10% extra credit towards your final grade. Plus, he pulls questions from his quizzes, and allows you to bring in a note card. I made over a 100% in the class, and didn't use the textbook once. Would recommend for an easy A
Only showed up to one class, Online Lecture Capture at the time. Didn't open a book once, looked at a lecture or two. Only things you have to do are the quizzes and tests. Tests are taken at a testing center online, however the quizzes are online as well at your own convenience. Word of advice; Quizlet helps you pass.
Teacher name: Collins, Daniel
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Collins is honestly one of the best professors at A&amp;M. Yes it is a difficult class with lots of homework, but he provides you with great study material. The only reason that you shouldn't do well in this class, is if you don't pull your weight and do what he tells you to do. He genuinely cares about his students and his lectures are hilarious.
Dr. Collins is a solid choice for professor, but I feel like he is a hit or miss with most people. You either worship him or hate him haha. A funny guy who really cares about his students, but his class is very challenging and the hw is a pain :( Had Bethel last semester &amp; to compare, Bethel has an easier class but I learned far more from Collins.
Daniel Collins is easily the best professor I have ever had. This class is hard. But the way he teaches and makes you work, you actually learn the material. He has so many resources for you if you don't understand anything and Gabbi is an exceptional IA. In this class, you will actually retain the information that you are receiving. 100% recommend.
He is a wonderful professor!! He pushes all of his students to go above and beyond!!! Gabby is a real gem and helps so much for exams!! The textbook problems he provides are unmatched when it comes to exam prep!
Dr. Collins is a great professor. He genuinely cares for his students and wants them to succeed. He has the ability to relate chemistry to common things to get a better understanding for the topic. Pay attention to the SI and AI review sheets because they are good examples of what his test would be like. I am taking him again for CHEM 102.
Dr. Collins was a great professor. I genuinely enjoyed his class even though it was difficult and chemistry isn't my favorite subject. He cares about his students and is always working to improve the learning environment but he is also tough. It is important to study hard and come to class, and if you dedicate the time to his class, you will be OK.
Dr. Collins is easily my favorite prof to date. Hes really funny and genuinely cares about his students success. Always available outside of class. The class itself is difficult but doable. Read the book before class, be sure to do all the ALEKS hw (itll help later!) and dont be afraid to ask for help. He wont bite you I promise!
Probably the best chemistry prof on campus. You will have to learn the material to succeed, but he provides a ton of resources and great teaching. The homework is time consuming occasionally, but was very helpful in learning the material. The tests are all multiple choice and can be challenging, but not overwhelming (unless you don't study).
TAKE COLLINS, especially if you have to take higher level chem courses later on. He expects a lot of his students, but he provides all the help you need to succeed. If you go to the IA &amp; SI sessions, do the book problems, and take advantage of office hours, you'll do well in this course. Collins is super funny, &amp; I very much enjoyed his class.
Tests are way harder than the homework provided, in addition if you know and hate aleks like most students do, get used to it. All of his homework and quizzes are through aleks. Very difficult professor, would not recommend.
Everyone complains on here but Collins is a nice guy and a GREAT prof. Yes, hes intimidating and yes, this class is incredibly difficult but hes entertaining, caring, &amp; clearly passionate about what he teaches. If you want something easy, DONT take him. If youre a hardworker and actually want to learn, Collins is your best bet.
College-level chemistry is going to be hard no matter what. Collins is a great choice for 101. His lectures are material-heavy, but he's super funny and likes to tell little stories to keep things interesting. My advice: GO TO CLASS, start the homework early (unfortunately, there is a lot), attend the SI sessions, &amp; be prepared to put in the work
Dr. Collins is one of the best professors I've ever had. He actually teaches and cares about his students. The homework on Aleks is annoying but you actually learn a lot. His tests are really difficult! Do the questions in the back of the book and from the SI sessions. Be prepared to study! His tests may be harder but taking his class is worth it.
This man is the only man I would ever dream of taking Gen. Chem with! He is a quirky, witty genius with an arsenal of dad jokes. The content is challenging, but Dr. Collins provides so many resources for success, so if you're not doing well, its on you. He can be a jerk in his own snarky way, but deep down he truly cares for his students! GREAT man
Great prof and great lectures. One of his most notable aspects is that he provides AMAZING Instructional Assistants and Supplement Instructors that help a TON. They help you understand any confusing material by providing you with five available sessions throughout the week. Taking him again for 102.
Make sure you attend class, there is an iClicker question before each class which you get points for at the end of the year. As long as you do the HW and quizzes on Aleks, which there is alot of, you'll be fine. While not used alot the book is helpful to do the practice problems since the tests are very similar to these questions.
His exams are the hardest out of every professor for Chem 101.
Dr. Collins is BY FAR one of the best profs at TAMU. He cares a lot about his students, and he does everything he can to help you succeed. Because he does so much, he expects you to utilize what he gives you, and he won't curve tests or give free-bee points. His lectures are fun and inclusive. If you want an A, work VERY HARD!
Dr. Collins is a great professor. He truly wants everyone to learn. He gives a ton of resources to help you study and his tests are genuinely trying to see if you know the material. No tricks. He's also pretty funny. Definitely taking him again for Chem 102
There are 3 exams and 1 final. No tricks on the tests, it's exactly as the ppt problems and SI/AI sessions. GO TO THE SESSIONS THEY ARE A LIFE SAVER!! If you know how to do the SI/AI problems and textbook problems he gives, you should do well. He's a funny guy so lectures are 10x more bearable, and I feel that things are explained well.
Teacher name: Roblyer, Dwight
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Very passionate and an all around solid professor who makes it clear what is needed to get an A. Go to lecture, look at powerpoints after class, and do the homework and you should be fine.
I wouldn't take him if you're taking 18 hours like me and if pol sci isn't relevant to your major. I feel the class is interesting but has too much honor HS busy work. If you make a bad grade there's room for lots of forgiveness but try to take an easier prof if you aren't interested that much in the topic. Great dude though.
Dr. Roblyer is very passionate about academic dishonesty. Don't be discourage is you get a bad grade on one or two test. The homework is a great cushion for your grades so make sure you do it to the best of your ability. He gave up to 4 extra credit points to your final grade so make sure you take advantage of those because it makes a difference!
Dwight is an incredible person and amazing teacher. His class is not easy, but he is very fair with grading, extra credit, and office hours. He truly cares about his students and their success. I went into the class thinking I was going to hate it and came out wishing I could take another one of his classes.
He really cares about his students learning. If you show up to class you don't even have to study for the exams to do well. He curves every test 5 points, and gives lots of extra credit opportunities. He's great!
2/2: In F18. Only 1 test could be missed wo univ excused abs. Then u have to take the alt makeup exam (TF,MC,Short answer,fill in the blank). Lowest test of 4 midtrms dropped. Final counts. HW based on articles. Invites class to thanksgiving. He checks your grade and helps you calculate test goals. 2 tries on hws (grade is avg of 2). Nice man. -JF
I will be writing 2 comments: In F18. I never liked politics. Material was heavy, but prof was very forgiving and helpful. Tons of extra credit (5pts added to every exam for free, 20pts added to total pts from online hw (acts as a test grade), and online research and activities (-1/2 a letter grade extra points)). Tests are noncumulative 40 MC. -JF
Dr. Roblyer cares so much about his students and offers every chance to succeed. If you study and read the text and attend lecture, this class is an easy A. I loved the way that beyond helping us understand the material, Dr. Roblyer also helped us understand how the political system works and the complex issues associated. TAKE HIM!!!
Dr. Roblyer was an amazing professor to have my first semester of college. He genuinely cares about all his students and is a super good guy. He doesn't take attendance, but going to class will help your grade. I noticed when I went to class more, I tended to score higher on the next exam. He offers a lot of extra credit towards end of semester.
Professor Roblyer had great reviews for his class. However, his test questions are designed specifically to deceive students and every time I went in with a question to his office hours he never really explained WHY the answer was what it was, just WHAT it was. He is a very nice man but paranoid about cheating and not open to helping on grades.
Seriously one of the best professors at Texas A&amp;M University. Dr. Roblyer truly cares about you as a person, always "working for your success" as he always said. Lecture was from pre-posted online slides, but with his own helpful commentary. Roblyer also offers a ton of extra credit in addition to dropping your lowest test grade. Highly recommend!
A great professor to take that, in the end, made me more "politically active". Is passionate about the subject itself and for his students. Five exams, homework, and extra credit assignments have made it an absolute easy A, if you put the work in it. Attendance is not mandatory but is recommended, as well as the textbook for several test questions.
Roblyer is one of the best POLS profs you can take. Great communication with students, very caring, genuinely wants you to learn. I would recommend showing up since a lot of information is given through the lecture. If you show up and study a little it's a simple class. Homework once a week and he drops the lowest test score. Super reasonable guy.
One of the best professors at A&amp;M. Truly cares about helping you learn the material, not just for the class, but for the real world as well. Offers extra credit and drops a test grade. Even invited anyone in our class staying at A&amp;M over the break to his house for Thanksgiving. Such a nice, caring professor. Would recommend his class to anyone!
If you go to class and listen during lectures you will be absolutely fine and will most likely get an A. I would recommend taking brief notes or taking notes on the powerpoint slides, as there can be a lot of information. This man genuinely cares about your grade in his class and wants you to do well in it, and in life in general.
Dr. Roblyer truly cares about his students. He often uses the phrase, "working for your success," and he lives this out. He provides plenty of extra credit and bonus points. He provides a plethora of resources to improve your exam scores. Above all, he inspires his students to learn local government.
Great prof, very caring about his students and will help you with whatever! There are 5 exams (final included) and you definitely have to attend lectures and pay attention but he does drop one test grade and offers lots of extra credit. There is also homework every week but very easy and helps your grade. He genuinely cares about the subject.
One of the easiest A's I've ever gotten. I've never had a class with so much extra credit offered and he will drop your lowest exam score (he won't drop the final though). Take him for POLS 207 if you can. Textbook is optional but I found it kind of interesting and the reading assignments are very short.
Dr. Roblyer is a good professor hes really passionate about what he teaches very accessible outside of class. I personally never read the book and the first four exams have questions about the book and so I barely passed all four exams but he did provide a lot of extra credit which did bump me up to a B. You just gotta work a bit extra to get A.
Take him if you can. The only time I ever showed up was for the exams and I made an easy A. He curves every exam by 5 points, offers 5-6 extra credit points onto your grade, lets you drop an exam, and adds points on to easy homework assignments. Lectures would be helpful, but online slides/resources were very helpful for the exams. He is liberal.
Teacher name: Bethel
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Bethel is definitely the best CHEM101 TEACHER at A&amp;M. However, he is a bit tricky. I remember getting destroyed by the first test because I studied what he emphasized in lecture, but the exam had nothing to do with that. I got used to his teaching and pulled my grade up from failing to a B at the end. The practice exams are not like his real exams.
He tells us hes intentionally tricking us and making his tests hard. You can study for days and are still not guaranteed to pass the class. You need extra tutoring to even think about passing.
Dr. Bethel is a great teacher. Be sure to stay on top of homework and attend class or you will not do well.
Good professor
He is literally a GEM. He is so funny, and his dad jokes are classic. He is a tough professor, but he makes it easy to learn, and if you work hard enough, you will do good. Make sure you get the clicker questions right and get a 100 on all the homework. This will boost your grade and easy to do because the homework has multiple tries!
Bethel is such a great teacher and I highly recommend him. Chem is tough but an A is very doable with Dr. Bethel. The homework is very helpful and sometimes long but they are essential to your grade. He also uploads practice tests that are extremely similar to the tests. If you study your notes and the practice test, the tests should be a breeze.
Very cool guy. Always made jokes in class and was more than happy to help during office hours. He is very tricky, though, when it comes to exams. I cannot stress enough to not procrastinate on homework! He also does clicker points, randomly, so make sure to come to class for that credit. Go to SI sessions, and other tutors, and you should be fine.
Study, study, study the homework!!! I didnt make the grade I wanted in the class but as long as you go to class and put in a lot of effort to going over the lecture slides, problems that he does in class, AND THE HOMEWORK. You are surely to pass.
Bethel is a great teacher, and though his tests are difficult, if you attend class and study an A is easily achievable. The homework is pretty heavy, but it prepares you for the tests.
His exams are little tricky but if you study hard you could get an A. Also his lectures are very good. Overall pretty good professor.
Solid choice but, if you just need a chem credit I would not recommend because you REALLY do have to study. Tests are not tricky but you have to pay attention to them because it's easy to make a mistake. Do OWL and Clicker Questions so you won't need an A on tests to get an A in the class. I'm practically a master at chem now but it was difficult.
I greatly enjoyed taking Dr. Bethel's class. All of his lectures were easy to understand and he mad learning chemistry enjoyable. Also, he is easily available outside to review test or homework problems. Would recommend.
I personally thought he was a spectacular professor. I really wanted him for CHEM 102 as well, but his class did not fit my schedule. He is the king of awfully hilarious chemistry jokes, but doesn't over due it. Overall, a really caring, patient professor who wants you to do good. Pay attention in lectures, take notes, and study. You'll do great!
Loved taking Bethel! Chemistry is hard, but he keeps lectures upbeat with dad jokes and does examples, so it's not just reading off slides. Attendance is mandatory for the most part, as he does clicker questions throughout the class. Reviews are pretty on par with the tests, and the OWL homework is an easy 100, and is a great way to study.
Dr. Bethel is a great professor, but his class is not easy. If you're not ready to work for an A, don't take his class, because you will not do well lol. The most important things are that he probably gives out the most hw, but they help with the test. Also, beware of test #3; it is very challenging and you will need to study a lot.
Bethel knows chem well. I felt that I knew topics better than my friends in other classes, until Exam 3. He is a very nice guy &amp; is actually really funny. Clicker &amp; HW is a great grade booster but doesn't prepare you for tests &amp; the tests are over 1/2 your grade. I Q'd bc I was too close to a D. GO TO CLASS FOR CLICKER Q's! Overall good but STUDY
Dr. Bethel is an incredible professor especially if you are going to continue in chemistry. You have to work for your grade but it is very possible to get an A.
My classmates and my review on Dr. Bethel keeps getting deleted. Dr. Bethel should be avoided. I would hope he stops teaching CHEM 101 and CHEM 102 at this prestigious institutional and stick to research. Also it should be noted that he has a bachelors and a PHd degree (No masters degree).
Bethel is a GREAT chemistry choice. I definitely struggle in chem, but I am willing to put in work. GO TO CLASS! He teaches through example problems, which I find helpful, so go through these in between lecture days to keep up. The tests are HARD, he puts a lot of easy mistake options for multiple choice. I did okay, but do OWL, it helps!!
I took Bethel for both Chem 101 and 102. He is a really great professor and truly cares about his students. You have to go to class for Clicker questions, but his lectures are interesting so its not too bad. Tests are hard, but he gives a massive curve at the end of the semester for both 101 and 102. I would definitely recommend him for Chemistry.

Teacher comments: 
Didn't really use the textbook, ALEKS is annoying but makes for an easy 100 on homework and has mock exams that are very similar to tests. Good lectures that make sense.
Study the ALEKS homework because the test questions are based off of them. Her lectures are helpful and she shows you how to do the problems during lecture. She takes attendance with the iclicker system so show up to every lecture. The way she scores the tests lets you miss 1 question and still get a 100, which means you could get extra points.
I had prof McCartney for both chem 101 and 102. I love her as a person, but the combination of ALEKS and super hard exams make me want to cry. If you study nonstop two weeks ahead of the exam, theres a chance youll pass. I would turn to other professors if you want an easy A, because she makes you work for it.
Dr. McCartney isn't as bad as people make her out to be. Her tests are harder than most profs but she prepares really well for them. There is always a mock exam that is similar to the exam. The homework is an easy 100 and attending class is also a portion of your grade, which is nice. She is an awesome lecturer and makes everything understandable.
Doc Mac is seriously not as bad as some people rate her. She is a very kind person and really has a great passion for chemistry. She goes over plenty of practice problems in class, she's great during office hours, and she gives you all of the resources that's necessary to pass the course. Her tests are a bit difficult, but do the mock tests prior.
Dr. McCartney is clear on her expectations, lectures clearly and concisely, and answers all questions inside and outside of class without making you feel discouraged. She clearly cares about your success in the course. Study hard, keep up with hw, and show up to class. A quarter of the overall grade are "freebie" points from iClicker question &amp; hw.
I love the way she teaches! She made me enjoy chemistry and although it was sort of difficult to get an A, it's not impossible! I did study a lot for exams but I really recommend SI sessions because chemistry is a hard subject regardless.
Doc Mac is an awesome professor who is super organized both in her lectures and in grading criteria. She is very helpful through email and office hours. She is passionate about chemistry and she teaches it very well and gives very understandable examples. Attendance counts for 90/1000 points. Grade based on attendance, online hw, &amp; tests.
She doesn't explain the concepts very well and the test questions are nothing like what we went over in class. There's a ton of homework on the online ALEKS system, and she didn't always give us much time to work on it. I love chemistry but this was my least favorite class because of her.
McCartney was the best prof I had all semester. Chem is a tough subject but if you go to class and pay attention you should be fine. McCartney does a great job of laying out her lectures logically and tells you everything you need in class. I rarely had to look at the book. Do the homework and go to class to get all the easy completion points!!
She has a hard reputation but if you work in the class, she's great! She is very helpful outside of class and is very accommodating. She is excellent at teaching and provides lots of resources so you can succeed, absolutely recommend.
Prof Mac is very sweet and helpful in person, but her class wasn't a walk in the park. She had iClicker questions everyday so come to class to get free points, and the hw we had could take hours on end on top of studying. Before each test she gave mock exams which were helpful, but come test day there was questions that didn't match the lecture.
Dr. McCartney is a great professor. She does pretty well at explaining concepts to students and is available after class during office hours. The test are difficult but she provides practice exams that do help for the most part. I highly recommend going to SI review session before the exams. Overall, the class is difficult, but manageable.
I loved Dr. McCartney! I didn't even buy the book, you don't really need it. You have to study! Her exams can be tough but they're fair and if you study you'll do fine. She does clicker questions everyday as attendance so it's good to show up, she makes her lectures interesting. She has mock exams for every exam, which really help.
Dr. McCartney isn't a bad prof but it is not an easy A. I had difficulty with her class because I was transitioning into my first semester of college and I had her at 8am MWF. Make sure you show up to all lectures for those iclicker points because they help your grade a ton. You are gonna have to use the SI sessions or outside resources.
Dr. McCartney moved very quickly through lectures and doesnt go into detail with math problems. Her mock exams were like the exams and her final was a lot more difficult and concept based. She used ALEKS for homework, but I didn't like it because it was time-consuming on things you didn't really need. Go to office hours and SI sessions. I didnt lol
McCartney is a solid choice for Chem101. I took AP chem in hs so this class was easier for me than others, but her tets are just like the practice questions she goes over in class and the mock exams she puts up. Hardest and most annoying part of class is the ALEKS hmk which was irrelevant to her tests and took ridiculous amt of time to do.
Dr. McCartney was one of my best professors my first semester. She is very sweet, and charismatic. Tries to engage the class and does not make lectures as boring as they could be. She posts practice exams that and look similar to the test. The overall course grade consisted of clicker points, and 4 exams not counting the final. Homework is doable.
McCartney was an okay professor. Not the best but she got the job done and did a pretty good job of explaining most topics. Her practice exams were usually like her actual ones and they let you know what concepts you needed to study and what type of questions she planned on asking. Her final was tough and kind of concept-heavy but doable.
I heard many bad things about McCartney before taking her class but it was not as bad as everyone said. Her tests are very hard compared to other professor's and she does not curve throughout the semester, maybe at the end. She does a great job in teaching the material but if you do not have Chem background the tests may be very challenging.
Teacher name: Smith, Jason
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is SO funny and really interesting to listen to. He gives extra credit if others don't show up and you do. Seriously just listen in class, read the book and take notes and you'll get an A. Not a blowoff class for sure. Show up and put in the effort he asks of you (which isn't much- he is chill) and you will succeed. I'll miss prof smith.
I took POLS 206 the previous semester with a different prof and made a C and thought i hated POLS until i had jason smith for 207. His lectures were very interesting, he related everything to current events, and threw in some dad jokes during each class. 10/10 would recommend, there's no better POLS prof at tamu
Smith is the best pols prof to take at tamu. Your grade is based on 3 exams and he gives you a review. If you go to class and write down whats on the powerpoint, you should get an A
He only tests over what he lectures in class, so while attendance is important, it's also well worth it. He is chock full of references that will surely make you laugh and you're always caught up on current events in his class. He will often give extra credit if you show up on a day that most people skip too. Only three (EASY) exams.
Pros : 3 Tests total with no final, charismatic and very comedic teacher, extra credit when &lt;50% students in class (and sometimes after tests), online quizzes and homework (Some low are dropped), afternoon classes, lectures only needed, and cares deeply about student success. Cons : Tests are extremely significan. Slides aren't posted online. JC
An amazing passionate prof, it'd be difficult to find someone better.
Your grade in the class is only 3 test grades and the tests are not impossible but it is difficult to get an A on them. There is no textbook and he doesnt post any notes so you need to go to class even though its not mandatory. He gave extra credit 2 times if you were in class so make sure to go to class.
He's a great prof, but your grade is based on 3 exams and its all lecture based. Get ready to take a lot of notes, and pay attention. Plus he's hilarious so you always laugh in class.
Smith makes lectures enjoyable! The class is based on only three tests that are all lecture based so you have to show up and take good notes. I got an A from the extra credit he gave so again, go to class and you will most likely get extra credit at some point. I would take another Political Science class from him for sure!
Most people thought this class was a doable A, however it was only based on 3 exams. He often times barely covered the specific questions on the exam and there is no textbook to get the info elsewhere. I was not the best at cracking his code (wording was confusing on 1/5 of the test questions IMO). But, he is entertaining and I learned a lot.
Dr. Smith is great at giving lecture's but you'll have a hard time on his test if you don't go to class. The grade is mainly based off three exams with easy online homework. I messed up bad on the first exam which made it hard for me to recover and get an A.
Dr. Smith's lecture is what made POLS 206 actually enjoyable. He makes a lot of funny jokes, and he go on rants about the most random things, which is pretty awesome. There are 3 test worth the majority of your grade, which is 60%. You also have online quizzes and homework. He will extra credit if less than half the class is there.
Dr. Smith is HILARIOUS. I learned more about life than state gov in this class. He actually made state government interesting and relevant for non- POLS majors. Everything comes from lectures, so show up. The one downside is his exams have difficult wording, and he may not go over everything on the study guides. He's also hard to reach over email.
If you want to pass, just show up to class because there is NO text book and he doesn't NOT post any notes or slides online. However, he goes off topic a LOT, and could never finish lecturing on time often leaving him emailing us late at night before an exam on all the info he didn't get to but expects us to know for the exam.
He doesnt use a book so its crucial that you attend class! he spends most of the class going on tangents about something that is happening and its kind of annoying because he doesnt make it through all that he is supposed to and we dont make it through the review.
Smith is the best POLS 206 prof. Super funny, non-biased on political views, tells super interesting stories and gives out extra credit occasionally for showing up to class. But, attendance is mandatory. He'll sneak test answers during the lecture so you must pay attention. Overall, the best prof I could ask for. Take him, you won't regret it.
Great prof!!!! Very good lecturer, kept it interesting . No book, so you need to go to class cause his tests are only lecture based. Do the review on ecampus and you're guaranteed a B. I would recommend this prof to anyone. Also, go to class as often as you can . He hands out extra credit at random times .
The class was easy enough, just very lecture based so be sure to take thorough notes. It's kind of hard to figure out what will be on the test because he takes up a lot of time with tangents which may or may not actually relate to the test which makes studying rough. Lots of dad jokes. Lots of political rants.
I absolutely loved Dr. Smith! He is HILARIOUS! He structures the class to do everything to help you pass, and he doesnt use a textbook which is really nice! He doesnt post his slides so the only way to get the information is to show up to lecture, he makes it interesting though. He gives out test reviews but they arent very comprehensive
At first it was hard for me to get info out of his lectures. He puts slides on the screen but mainly talks. But I got used to it and loved his class! He gives most information in lecture, but the textbook really helps understand concepts better. A great professor, and he will definitely keep you laughing! Don't let your phone go off though or yikes
Teacher name: Williamson, Vickie
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
if you're like me and suck at math, then she isnt a good choice. she's ok at explaining concepts, but when she works out the problems she doesn't explain very well. there r clickers, tons of homework (keep up). tests are hard and short even though she has practice online; she likes tricky ?s. She drops the loweset exam grade; 4 exams, 8 assignments
Williamson was by far my favorite prof my freshman year. Chem is a hard class but her tests are very predictable and with all the homework and other assignment grades, there is a bit of a cushion. LOTS of online homework, be prepared for nightly homework. Took her for 101 &amp; 102 and I would take her again without a doubt, but 102 is much harder
Dr. Williamson is a great professor who really loves what she teaches. She gives students all the resources they need to succeed. I'm taking her again for 102.
She is a nice lady . Test are though not many questions . Studied TONS and went to A+ still got a B !
This class was really challenging for me. I HIGHLY recommend going to A PLUS tutoring, it helped me so much. Williamson was not very good at explaining. I learned a lot of things on my own time. Must attend class bc there are clicker questions every time. Her tests are very conceptual so you must know material.
She was a good prof, and she gave her all in teaching. The lectures are the most important part of the class. She requires clicker questions (questions in class that you have to answer with a remote that count toward the final grade). If you take GOOD NOTES and read the text, an A in the class is definite. Also, her practice exams are accurate.
Lectures are straight and to the point, and she does do clicker questions so make sure you come to class or it'll affect your grade. Her tests have concept based as well as mathematical questions, but as long as you do her online review tests and understand the homework, you'll get an A.
Williamson's lectures are very average, and her tests aren't simply math, it's also very conceptual. She gives you MANY resources to prepare for tests, if you dedicate yourself and use all her resources you should be okay. Attend class so you can get clicker points &amp; do all the homework, it''ll help you learn. (I did not take AP Chem in HS)
I don't have experience with any other chem professors, but Williamson was great. She really does care for her students a lot. There is homework due after every lecture, but don't let that scare you. It's pretty much just a completion grade because it lets you do it until you get it right. I would also recommend going to A plus for tutoring.
Dr. Williamson is an AMAZING professor. She gives a lot of homework, but it is helpful and good practice for her tests. Going to class isn't mandatory, but if you want extra credit, you definitely go for clicker points.
Dr. Williamson is an amazing prof and made the course very easy. I am taking her next semester as well. The only downside is that she goes out of the typical order which makes Lab a little more difficult, but I was still able to get an A in both. I would highly suggest her over the other options.
Dr. Williamson is the best! She provides fill-in-the-blank powerpoint slides and she's all about making sure her students understand. She is NOT memorization-heavy and is very caring. She provides tons of resources, including practice exams and videos working some of the practice exam problems. Very clear grading criteria, lots of help
Lots of homework on MindTap but it really helps to teach you. Her own private website is a gem and helped me pass this class. She posts practice exams there and tapes her lectures there as well. Going to Ryan's test reviews helps a TON, sometimes he can explain a topic better than her. She also drops a few bad grades to help boost your final grade.
I've never seen a professor put in so much effort for the class. Williamson will probably explain Chemistry better than any other professor available, and she offers a whole lot of small assignments to boost your grade. She has her TA do a review before the test, which I found to be super helpful
She has a personal website with all of her power points and taped lectures., which comes in super handy to study. Her tests are similar to her practice exams, and she gives partial credit, but the tests are really short. If you do the MindTap homework and the practice exams, you'll do really well. Go to Ryan's test reviews! They help a lot.
She really does care about the individual student but the course work is very hard to understand the concepts.
She is such an awesome person. I enjoy this class so much. Although it is hard material, she always tries to make it interesting with demonstrations in class. She is hilarious and keeps me entertained in class. Her tests are very conceptual based, but with all the resources she provides you can make a good grade if you study.
There's clicker questions, so you can't miss class. There's this major assignment due the first week it was 36 points and took several hours. After that its just homework on mind tap every other day. It does not really help you for the exam. Office hours are the best. Do what's on her frequently asked questions and Practice Exams. She's caring.
Easily the sweetest professor at A&amp;M. Cares for every single one of her students and their success. If you do poorly on exams, you have room to pick your grade up with her online assignments. Explains everything in an understanding way and doesn't make things unnecessarily hard. She's the best even if you don't care for chemistry!
If i had a dollar for every time she said "so the idea is" id be a millionaire
Teacher name: Lim, Phaik
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Lim is a sweet and funny lady. Unfortunately, nothing from lectures is even on the exam. Everything is from the book, an opinionated mess of statistics. She only gives 4 exams (50 questions), doesn't curve. Don't even go to class, read the book for an A, or take it two weeks at a community college :(
I love Dr. Lim. Her lectures are hilarious and help the information to stick in your head. Your only grades are from tests, no homework or quizzes or anything, so make sure you read. Her tests are reasonable and everything is on the slides or in the book, but the material is memorization heavy- especially for graphs.
She's a hilarious but be warned she has no filter. If you get easily offended don't take her and if you do please don't complain because it makes the class boring for everyone else. In short she makes a very boring subject insanely funny.
Prof Lim is an upbeat instructor that does her best to make the content fun. Exams are a combination of lecture and reading from the text so be ready for that. If you go to class and pay attention in lecture you will do fine in the class.
This class can be an easy A if you don't skip class and you read the textbook. Usually the professor's lectures are pretty entertaining!
offered a point of extra credit, bumps up a .5, get ready to read because the class is straight from the textbook. Only a portion of the test is from lecture. I never went to class and just read over shared notes online and did fine.
Dr. Lim is the best POLS prof here. She is so funny and insightful. She knows so much about the gov here but can relate it to the gov in her home country which makes it interesting. She gives straight facts but not everyone can handle the truth. There is nothing but 4 exams but not much extra credit so keep that in mind if not showing up to class.
I honestly believe this was the best class of my first semester here at A&amp;M. A very good teacher for this class, teaches material well and makes getting an A in her class very easy. If you attend lectures and pay attention, you can A every test with only an hour or two of studying. Do not take her if you are easily offended, she has crude humor.
Her exams are also based on the lectures, which are not mandatory, but the lectures are extremely helpful and help a ton.
I never went to class much because she spent half the time talking about everything except state government. Fortunately her exams are easy enough that if you have common sense and review a couple quizlets/lecture slides before the exam you'll get at least a B. There's also 2 points extra credit on your final average if you take this survey.
This class ended up being much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Lim is very funny and makes the lectures interesting. I definitely recommend taking notes over the lectures as well as reading the textbook. The tests weren't too difficult, and I only ended up making a B because I didn't study much for the last exam and didn't do so well.
Dr. Lim is very funny and I thought the class was easy.
Dr. Lim is hilariously relatable. She is so down to earth and makes it clear with her chill classroom environment. She makes a boring subject interesting with her humor, her wisdom, and her use of sources. She attacks all political beliefs and sticks to the facts. Warning: Not a class for the easily offended.
Dr. Lim is incredible! Her tests are extremely correlated with the textbook, so READ. Also, make notecards! While this isn't a hard class, you still need to apply yourself and work hard. Dr. Lim is hilarious and cares about her students. Her accent isn't a problem, so no worries about that. She only gives 4 exams-- no homework or quizzes, so read!
She is an awesome prof that likes to share interesting stories in her class. I feel like she is deeply concerned with the general parochial freshmen population and tells stories to let them be more open minded. Lectures cover some nitty gritty stuff that might be on the exams. Go to classes and its an easy A.
There are only four test grades a semester so be sure to study. It is a lecture only class, so be prepared to take notes. That being said, Professor Lim keeps class interesting by cracking jokes and relating the topics to student's lives. Go to lecture, take good notes and read the textbook and you should be fine.
Dr. Lim's class only has 4 tests which are sem-diffucult. Her lectures are sometimes hard to follow because she sometimes goes off on a tangent. The book was the only reason that I was able to do semi-well on the tests.
She is a fun and engaging professor. She keeps things interesting through her anecdotes and jokes. The class is heavily data driven, and the entire course is graded off of 4 multiple choice exams. If you are good at interpreting data from charts and graphs, or you can take good notes and pay attention, you should do fine.
Prof. Lim has some of the most entertaining lectures I've been to. Be prepared for only 4 tests that will make up your entire grade for the course, but so long as you take good notes during lecture, thoroughly review your notes, and understand some of the key points, you should walk out with at least a B.
Prof Lim is pretty brash so if you are easily offended I wouldn't suggest her, she is entertaining in lecture and posts her power points online which are very helpful for studying. READ THE BOOK, I bought one 3 editions old and it worked out. Your grades is based on 4 tests so make a study group and go to class. She is helpful in office hrs also!
Teacher name: Kilmer, Kendra
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Professor Kilmer is good at clearly and thoroughly explaining the math material. She goes over each process step by step. However, she can be a bit redundant if you are somewhat familiar with the material from other math courses. Attending her lectures are essential. She holds every class until the last minute. Overall, a good and thorough prof.
Her tests were half multiple choice and half true/false. Sometimes she did not explain things very well but there were ways to access her for questions or help.
Kilmer is a very good math prof. There is homework that is due every week but it is usually easy. Her tests are easy, but get harder as the semester goes on. She is always accessible and there are always week in reviews and help sessions. If you pay attention and understand how to do the homework than you should be successful.
Mrs. Kilmer was a decent prof but I always felt like her lectures lasted sooo long. She repeats herself often to make sure everyone understands but it can get old fast. If youve struggled with math in the past I would recommend her since she really cares about your success and is always available for questions. The class easy overall so easy A too
She has worksheets to print off before every class, and in class she just goes through the worksheet and shows you how to do the problems. She makes some videos online to explain some of the ones she won't do in class. Really helped me understand how to solve the problems. Would definitely take again
I absolutely HATED this professor! The textbook will not help you whatsoever and she is agonizingly slow in the lecture. If math is not your strongest subject I highly suggest taking this course at a community college. If you have to take this make sure you utilize office hours like crazy but all in all this professor is awful.
I am horrible at math and I personally could not follow along with her teaching techniques. She does offer a lot of outside help, like Week in Reviews, which are extremely helpful for practice.
Kilmer is a interesting woman, but if math is not your best strength I suggest not taking her. I'm alright in math, but she seemed to get me confused on what were doing. There's clicker questions very class so SHOW UP. there's groups which I tough was helpful. Overall not the best but not the worst, just depends if you can learn math quick.
Professor Kilmer, in my opinion, was a great professor. I took her my first semester at A&amp;M in math 140 and she made a huge difference in how challenging it was for me. She does week-in reviews every week and makes videos on how to do certain problems on the homework. Her class, syllabus, and grading is VERY organized. You have to work for an A.
1. assigned seats 2. she takes a whole class to do one easy problem 3. the tests are very similar to the group quizzes and week-in reviews 4. clicker questions are sometimes over material that has yet to be covered 5. the final replaces lowest test grade but it is cumulative 6. easy math just interesting professor
Overall, she's an alright math teacher (speaking from someone who is good at math) Clicker questions EVERY CLASS so attendance is basically mandatory. She teaches like her students are 2nd graders, but she's generally pretty caring.
Kilmer is a very boring lecturer. She doesn't expand no any ideas and just teaches the examples. It is easy to get an A, just don't expect much from her end. If you have taken any prior calculus then this class will be a breeze. Just make sure to do the homework and show up for clicker questions. Also she assigns seats which sucks.
Avoid at all costs. She takes an hour to get through 3 example problems, assigns you a seat, and does clicker questions. If math is not your strong suit, do not take her class.
Not worth taking. She gives terrible feedback.
Very good lecturer for a very big class. Goes a little bit slow so its good if you struggle, but if not it can get a little boring. I did very well with minimal studying because she provides very good resources for test review and is very helpful with any questions. Very good class for freshman moves at a good pace
Ms. Kilmer is a true gem. She is constantly available for her outside of class through her office hours and week-in reviews. I love that we just print the notes and then go over each problem/concept in class as it helps me study for the exams. The homework can be tough at times as it sometimes requires higher thinking than talked about in class.
Shes a sweet professor and is willing to help, but when you go to her for help she isnt sure what to tell you to do differently if youre struggling and have used all of her resources. I wouldnt recommend her if youre not good at math.
Kilmer is a great professor who explains concepts extremely well. She really cares about her students and their success. I'd definitely recommend her. She does use iclickers and assigns weekly homework.
Missed a couple classes and paid for it. Lots of people like her, we just didnt vibe
Kilmer requires weekly hw, but you have multiple tries on each problem. There are many opportunities to get easy grades from daily I-Clicker participation points. Tests were easier than i expected and she gives tons of resources to get additional help and makes it very clear what is expected from you each class! She can be a bit redundant though...
Teacher name: Rao, Asha
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Rao definitely had a great personality and was fun to listen to in lecture. A lot of what's in her exams is from the lectures so I'd definitely suggest going to every one. Her tests are a bit harder than others but still passable as long as you put in the work to study for them.
Dr. Rao was very abrasive. I thought her personality and offhand comments took away from the overall value of her class. The content of the class was overall very reasonable, but I never felt that she was a professor you could go to without being belittled. As a teacher, I liked her better than Dr. Kemp but worse than Dr. McKnight.
Dr. Rao was the one of the best educators I've ever had. As long as you participate, she genuinely wants you to succeed. She makes you work for your grade, but as long as you study lots and show interest in biology, she is willing to teach you. I truly recommend her as a professor if you want to learn the material, and she's an awesome person.
She's very approachable. You have to put in work to do well, and Dr. Rao will give you all the keys to succeed.
Pros : No Quizzes, extremely easy homework, posts lecture slides to study, sassy comedic teacher, 6% Extra Credit through participation activity, fair grader and is amazing in office hours. Cons : Tests are difficult and heavily impacts final grade, morning classes are hard to wake up for, and if you slack off she will call you out (It's fair). JC
Prof Rao's course is pretty interesting and easy However, there was a total of 12 lectures in powerpoints, maybe 5 of them were pretty long and had very long homeworks The quizzes are simple some of them even being 3 open ended questions
People complain about Dr. Rao, but if you do the work you should be fine. She's very clear about what you need to know and what you don't. She posts her lecture slides and learning objectives, which she uses to make the tests so go over them. She likes to crack jokes in class, but she also isn't afraid to call you out if you're sleeping.
Dr. Rao is very passionate about biology, which can make the class hard. She tries to make the class fun by cracking a few jokes here and there, but she will get frustrated if you do not participate in class or do not understand something she is covering. She hates when a student says they "do not understand," but SI can really help you with that.
Dr. Rao makes you work for what you want, but she isn't unfair. Her test are viewed to be harder than the other professors, and during class she will sometimes slam the hammer down on us, but she genuinely is a nice person overall. Make sure you study her powerpoint in great detail, she likes to test on specifics. Do-able, but not an easy A.
I really enjoyed Raos class, but you might struggle if you dont have a strong background in Biology. She gives learning objectives that you can use to study for the tests. You have lots of chances to get bonus points. I know you cant choose your TA, but if you end up with Aishat O. then you are blessed. She is the best TA!
Dr. Rao was my favorite prof this semester. Her exams are VERY detailed (SO GO TO CLASS &amp; PAY ATTENTION), but you get a good amount of extra credit. Study IN ADVANCE, you cannot cram for her exams last minute. She's hilarious &amp; very understanding if you go to her office hrs if you're confused about something. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions!
Dr. Rao is a great professor and makes you really learn biology, rather than just memorize definitions and functions. Although at times she can get angry and take it out on everyone, it makes the lecture all the more interesting. I would recommend going to class because there are extra credit opportunities, and make sure to keep up on the readings.
Dr. Rao is obviously very smart and well educated in Biology, but it makes it difficult to learn from her. She is hard to approach and is very crude, and gets frustrated when you don't understand biology concepts. she expects you to know everything before class.
Super easy class. I finished with a 99. Each week is a seperate online module with certain things to complete (discussion and a quiz) or "watch this video and write a 2 page paper". As long as you are on top of things and don't miss deadlines you will get an A.
She's tough but as long as you put in work and go to class you'll be fine. She makes awkward jokes sometimes and goes really fast in her lectures though. You'll probably be better off with Tag but she's a solid prof.
Not the worst. Her tests are challenging, please be aware of that. She can be intimidating but just talk to her during office hours. There are extra credit options so don't feel too defeated. Go to lectures, she tries her best to clarify confusions. Don't let her make you feel invalid, she can be blunt. Go to SI. You can try A+ tutoring. Good luck.
Dr Rao is very honest and sometimes she's really funny but overall this is a really difficult class. You have to read the textbook online and there's weekly homework. You have to go to class to get bonus points from the attendance checks. I had to go to outside tutoring and study a lot to get an A but it's possible if you work hard.
She points out when things in the textbook or powerpoint are not needed. Every thing, including the textbook is online and free. Does surprise attendance checks but you need to go to lecture as she explains exactly what she means. She posts power points online. Go to SI sessions. I failed all 3 tests and got a c because there are many HWs/others.
She is pretty cool when you need to talk to her and what she helps you out a lot but if you don't go talk to her you will struggle
Dr. Rao is very straight forward with what she expects. She is a great professor, but will make you work for your grade. Going in to this class, there were a lot of bad comments about her - but she makes lecture enjoyable with difficult application heavy tests. Would recommend if you REALLY really want to learn the material and not just pass
Teacher name: Patzewitsch, Wendy
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Patzewitsch is very passionate about her field and is a lively presenter. Simply show up to class everyday and take notes and you'll pass. Her exams are based off what she says and presents in lecture. The grades are based off exams only so just study your notes beforehand or go to SI sessions and you'll do fine.
Such a nice professor! Attendance isnt mandatory but you should still go to class because she shows in-class videos that questions on the test are from and she also occasionally will tell u a question shes putting on the test. However, if tests are not your strong suit, dont take her because thats the only grades other than a project.
She had very clear due dates, although she did not offer extra credit, her class was pretty straight forward. The tests weren't hard if you listened to the lectures. The online lectures were really short. She bumped up my grade too. Assignments were easy and she graded easy too. Lots of grades to help also (quizzes, assignments, exams)
This class was okay, but a little boring. If you watch all the videos and put a little effort into the project (follow rubric to a T), you should easily get an A, but some of the quiz questions were very picky; most were pretty manageable. There are two tests (midterm and non-cumulative final) which are pretty similar to the quizzes.
They provide weekly work that's easy to keep up with. There aren't too many exams and the prof gives a week or so before the exam to let students study. There is a semester project that involves some research but nothing too extreme.
Her tests are extremely hard. I went to the study sessions offered by the academic success center, went to test reviews, and every single lecture and still made a D in the class. Youre graded by 3 tests and a final, but the lowest test grade is dropped. I recommend her if youre up for a challenge, but if youre looking for an easy A, not her.
Not gonna lie this class is HARD. Patzewitsch does not have any points on her lecture slides and talks fast (and is boring) but be ready to type/write as fast as possible. The only grades are the 3 tests and a paper, so make sure you really study for the tests. Each test covers a ton of material and every question is "all of these are true except".
Her lectures follow the book but she explains with her own bias opinion. There are only 3 grades posted and all are exams, final is optional. Her exams are true/false based &amp; are very tricky. No help when it comes to understanding content or the core project. High key DO NOT recommend.
Dr. Patz is an incredible lecturer. She really knows her stuff and stresses things she thinks are important. I studied hard for her test and got A's on two and a B on one. The final replaces your lowest grade. I got an 89 and she won't bump me:) One project that takes like 2 hrs. Tests are hard, look at her slides.
The quizzes and tests were both very easy. The assignments were okay, some definitely were harder than others. Overall, this online class was a pretty easy A. She drops an assignment grade and a quiz grade so even if you mess up on one or don't understand the instructions you'll be fine. Take this if you need an easy science.
I loved Patzewitsch as a professor! She has a funny personality and really has a way of making you see more sides to different stories. Her tests were consistently based off of lectures, so reading the book is optional but of course helpful. The course is based off of 4 exams but she drops your lowest grade.
Great professor, passionate about the subject! Grade based on your best 3 of 4 exams. Exams based almost entirely on lecture. Show up, take notes and review them before the exam, and you'll do good.
I took her for GEOS 101 and she was a great choice! As long you show up, participate in class, and do the homework, you'll get an A. She's super sweet and knows what she's talking about!
Only 3 exams and nothing else so your grade relies on them. Her lectures are long and boring but the exam is 80% material directly from lectures. If you takes notes in class and memorize the ppt (posted online) you should get a B/A
I took her upper level geography course as a Freshman. Her tests are based solely on her lectures. The only time I used the textbook was to study maps. The slideshow she uses only has picts and videos, so if you don't go to class then you will not have any material to work with. She has short 10 page readings that you will have a few exam q's on.
This professor has a genuine interest in teaching her class. If you enjoy lectures, that's all you have to pay attention to in order to do well. Only homework (for Geog301) was extra readings which were 20 mins at most. Show up, pay attention, learn, take good notes, and you will do good
Just show up to class and listen, and you will get an A.
Show up to class and write down to powerpoint slides (and take notes on the videos) if you even want a shot at doing well in the class. She doesn't post her powerpoints online. The test questions are straight from the notes, just read over them a few times the night before the tests. There are 3 tests and a final, but the final is optional.
I didn't use a textbook and forgot to study for every exam. Basically, show up to class and write down what is on the slides and your good. She is super nice but will sometimes go off on tangents. There is one "project" that counts as part of a test, other than that this class is graded by 4 tests but she drops the lowest one.
She was a nice person but she didn't post her slides online so if you don't go to class you won't get any info.
Teacher name: Bollinger, Kathryn
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She makes a relatively easy class much harder than it needs to be. Everything must be done exactly as she wants or it will be counted (at least partly) wrong (even if the final answer is correct). She has lots of tedious rules and is very strict. If you pay attention she does explain the material, just not worth the hassle, imo take someone else.
Gives lots of opportunities to improve grade. 4 tests, no final. 10 pop quizzes+10 in class assignments, hw assignments on each chapter section. Gives extremely clear notes. Grades tough wants you to do the problems EXACTLY how she does them. Has weird phone policy/bad attitude at times. Wasnt terribly hard to get an A, had to study but not much.
Doesn't allow electronics in her classroom AT ALL, will call you out if your phone is even on. Gives a ton of homework and quizzes only worth 10% of your grade combined. She is very specific about how your work must be shown, isn't forgiving when grading. Do at home problems b/c she might get frustrated and give pop quiz. She is good at teaching.
Kathryn is very organized, and gives you notes to fill in during class. However, she does move a little fast and comes off as very curt and not very approachable if you have questions. If you aren't good at math, you will definitely have to go to help sessions. She's not the worst teacher I've ever had, but I wouldn't take this class again.
Follow directions, do your hw and you will do just fine. She is an amazing lecturer and makes the information super easy to understand but she demands your respect. NO PHONES IN HER CLASS. Don't even try... She's sarcastic and gives lots of grades to help you out. I really enjoyed her class but if you aren't willing to respect her, don't take her.
Good teacher. Takes class SO seriously, so it's definitely not a blowoff course. This course requires a serious amount of effort - homework/reading (even for math, I know), pop quizzes, ICAs (in-class assignments), etc. Very specific grader; every bit of work is to be shown (EXACTLY LIKE DONE IN CLASS) or you'll fail.
If you want an easy math class, this is it. Go to class, pay attention and do the Web assign homework and you will pass. This prof is very good at explaining subjects and if you are struggling to understand something, she is always available in her office hours. This is a great class and I def recommend her!
She has a sarcastic sort of humor that makes class interesting. If you want a slack off class, this is not it. She really cares that you learn and you can tell. She does not allow any electronics in her classroom and she gives pop quizzes, but that is about all the bad I can say about her. And honestly those are not bad things, so take her!!
Kathryn is a really good professor and knows a lot about what she is teaching. The tests are mostly short answer and are pretty difficult, but if you follow along with the notes, do the WebAssign, and the Week-in-Review then you will do fine. She is a hard grader and you MUST go to class, but she does what she can to help her student succeed.
While Kathryn's class was extremely difficult (especially for someone who doesn't do well in math) it was doable. She is willing to help you if you make the effort. Don't wait until the last minute to do anything and go to the SI sessions if you are struggling. I wasn't able to meet during her office hours so she met with me at a different time.
In class assignments and quizzes account for a large part of your grade--don't go to class, you will not pass. Very abrupt person. Very tough grader. She knows her math, but if you do not have a math mentality it will be a nightmare for you. I would not recommend to take this prof if you struggle at all with math or have a heavy course load.
Good at teaching, but no matter how much you study you cannot control how tough of a grader she is. One time I put a lower case letter rather than uppercase in a formula and she took off two points on my test. Shes a bit intimidating and will get angry if you excuse yourself from class from coughing (trust me it happened in mine). Study a lot
Shes a good person, shell bump ur grade at the end if u need it but she can be ruthless on the tests and quizzes and will refuse to provide any curve ever she does her best to help those struggling by only counting the best however many quiz and hw grades but dont think bc of that u can just blow them off bc thats whats gonna save u at the end
She is not a bad professor but she will make you work for your grade so if you miss a class you better go to office hours. Would I recommend her, only if you are a good math student but if she is your last choice she wont hurt you.
AWEFUL. Tough grader &amp; goes through the material fast. Her tests are all free response and she is extremely picky. If math isn't your strength, do NOT take her. I would recommend taking it with a different prof or at a community college. I spent countless hours studying &amp; in tutoring.
Coming from someone who's taken multiple math classes here, she really isn't that bad. Would I recommend her? No, but if she is your only option don't feel like you don't have a chance. You're gonna have to do a lot of outside work to pass but the material isn't impossible, even if you fail 3 quizzes in a row, if you go to see her shell help.
Honestly, I should've just taken this class at blinn. She's a typical college professor that will fail you and keep you from graduating and not lose a wink of sleep about it. Like all math classes here at A&amp;M its tough and requires a good amount of work, so if you can help it take it at blinn or with her if all your other classes are blow offs.
The only people who take her class are the people who have no other choice. This class will turn a good semester into a nightmare. If you are taking other classes that require much attention and time, forget about trying to pass hers because everything she assigns takes hours because she literally teaches material BACKWARDS!!! DO NOT TAKE HER
In order to get anything higher than a D or C you're gonna have to get tutored, go to her office hours, and spend hours trying to teach yourself. Oh and if you didn't take precalc in high school you're gonna get wrecked, bc she just assumes you already know half of what she's teaching . Just do yourself a favor and sign up for a different prof
Kathryn is a good professor in all but her grading is extremely tough, she will take off on very little things and that can completely mess with your grade. Even if you understand the material, you will not feel so confident after getting your exam score back. I wouldn't take her if you aren't too good at math.
Teacher name: Lewis, Jennifer
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
This class was the most stressful class of my life. She is nice and funny, but I struggled with this class the most. Her lectures make no sense because she constantly gets off topic and is not clear in lecture AT ALL. tests are also hard too. So if youre not a math person, take someone else that will be able to teach the content better.
Prof. Lewis's class was a very hard lecture to sit through due to the fact that she could never really stay on task or focused. I always looked up other professors notes to help me understand the topic. Her first test is really easy so ace it. She curves test if the grades are horrible and gives an extra credit paper at the end.
The first test is really easy so get a good grade on it. don't procrastinate on the homework modules, and read other profs notes. She is super scatterbrained and her lectures are impossible to follow. She posts the notes online but its really hard to follow, and most of the time she makes up her own problems and makes mistakes. extra credit at end.
Professor Lewis is a sweet lady, and will generally work with you if you make it known you are struggling. That being said, it is hard to follow along in her lectures because she can make simple math seem confusing or more complicated. Towards the end of the semester she had a few opportunities to make up some lost points.
Lewis is not a good professor in that she has very unorganized notes and its difficult to follow what she is saying. I feel like she never really gives steps on how to do something, she just shows one or two examples. Class is kind of a waste of time if you google how to do things. Tests are easy (beware of test 2) Over all not hard just annoying.
Professor Lewis has a very difficult time teaching course material. It takes way too long, she's hard to understand, and makes mistakes that throw you off. Her notes aren't helpful at all but it's very hard to learn from her in class so it's hard to learn anything. Her office hours are full of students so she rarely can help you then. Do not take
Although Lewis is super funny and nice, she makes a lot of mistakes and is quite hard to follow at times making it hard to get a good understanding of material. Offered an extra credit quiz and the cumulative final could replace your lowest test grade. 3-5 homework assignments every week, and may struggle a lot if you don't go to class.
It was difficult to understand her most of the times. She isn't that good at explaining concepts and it was kind of hard to follow her work. Make sure you do all the reviews that she has provided before each test. I didn't get an A on a single test except the final and I ended with an A in the class.
Professor Lewis does a lot of examples during lecture, but she does go pretty fast so you have to keep up. She answers questions very well though. Attendance is not mandatory but you might not do so hot if you skip class regularly. She gives up to 30 pts extra credit on lowest test grade and for us she replaced 2nd lowest test with final exam grade
Rearrange your entire schedule before you take the professor. She is a very sweet and funny lady but she is the worst professor I have ever had. She does not know how to lecture and you cannot understand her. I am an A+ student and study hard but this class was impossible without outside tutoring. Do whatever you can not to take her.
Professor Lewis is a very sweet, funny, smart lady. Although, I think she is too smart and tends to forget to "dummy things down" for her students. We get assigned 3-5 homework assignments about every 9 days and I went to office hours with the TA every week because the homework was often quite difficult/ she went too fast during lecture
Professor Lewis wasn't awful, I had her for the 2nd half of the semester, and she definitely does better than other Calculus 3 professors. She is very soft spoken and does mess up in class, but she is knowledgeable on the subject and tests are fair. Outside resources helped me a lot to get through the class though.
Not the best lecturer, but she knows the material and is helpful is you go to her outside of class. The subjects learned were not hard, but if you don't go to class, don't expect to make a good grade. A lot of the people in my class who complained about her were either never actually in class or didn't do the homework.
I had to q drop this class because I just couldn't do it. The subject was relatively easy, but for someone who is bad at math, Prof Lewis didn't really help much. I went to the week in reviews and even got outside tutoring. Going to class to take notes made me even more confused. Teaching style just wasn't for me, but she's a really sweet lady.
She's a really nice lady but she is the most ineffective teacher I've ever had. I had to use other teacher's notes and reviews to do the homework and then her tests are nothing like the homework at all. She does let you correct quizzes which is nice but this class is really difficult even if you are good at math.
Professor Lewis is a nice lady but not an effective teacher. I had learned the material in high school and somehow UNlearned it through her lectures. I had to use another professor's notes to learn the material myself and try to ignore her lectures because they made me worse off. Luckily, she replaces the lowest exam with the final and a bonus quiz
She is a very nice woman, but as a professor, she isn't really what you'd want. She's fairly disorganized and doesn't do a good job explaining how to do most of the problems presented. Her explanations made you feel more confused instead. I literally had to teach myself and just went on YouTube for help as her lectures weren't even helpful.
Very sweet woman, but not a great professor. She was often scrambled and unorganized in her lectures. Three tests that aren't terrible, but definitely require some self-teaching. Tries to help your grade with group projects and a bonus exam at the end of the semester. Easy B if you do the homework.. I did not, and will take end up with a high C..
Unless you REALLY know your math, do not take Lewis. I went to tutoring, did the week- in- reviews, read the textbook, looked at another professors notes, did all of her online practice exams, went to her for an extra practice exam, and still failed every exam. She does not explain well or even finish her problems in lecture. Take another prof.
Lewis is such a sweet lady and would make a great grandmother. But math professor?... not so much. She doesn't teach instead she just does examples but doesn't say how she got it.
Teacher name: Edens, Pamela
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Edens is funny, but she gets off topic really easily and will spend too much time talking about subjects that have nothing to do with the class. Her tests are awful because they're in the either-or format. Basically, most of the answers are right you just have to pick the most right one. 4 tests, 1 assignment. Would not take again.
You NEED to take Dr. Edens just for the experience. She is super funny, very relatable, welcome and open, everything you could ask of a professor. I highly recommend her, she's just truly the best. 3 exams, 1 final. You have participation quizzes once a week + a paper. Take note of anything she particularly points out!! - you will be tested on it
Shes a nice lady and funny prof, but her tests are awful. Theyre multiple choice but you have to pick the most right choice. And shes unorganized so you have to do a lot of preparation outside of the class.
Dr. Edens is the best thing that has happened to TAMU! She's incredibly funny and super nice. If you do what she tells you to do (like read the textbook) this class will be an easy A. Honestly though, the only reason you need to read the textbook is because psyc is too broad to fit into 50 min lectures so it's not like she's making you work.
Three exams + final, non cum. Two essays, easily graded just do everything listed in the instructions. You may have to read the textbook because some exam questions are derived from there. Easy going, easy A. She is funny. This was the first PSYC 210 that she taught and she is actively trying to make it harder for next semesters.
The class isn't hard at all and Dr. Edens is so fun and caring. The class is interesting. If you go to lecture and read your book, tests are easy.
Professor Edens was an okay teacher. You had to show up to class to do well in the course. The textbook is needed since a lot of questions on the exams come from the book. Final isn't cumulative with helps.
Take her! You will not regret it - she is one of the best professors at A&amp;M and you will be so happy that you took her class :) Exams are straightforward, gives attendance quizzes and is overall awesome!
One of the best! Super sweet woman, really makes class interesting. She does random attendance quizzes but her lectures make you actually want to go to class. Pretty easy grader as long as you clearly do what's stated in your papers (there's only like two).
LOVE HER - she's such a passionate teacher and loves to share knowledge, advice, and funny stories or news articles that are relevant to class. I would take her again for something else if I could. 10/10 recommend. Some textbook reading is required for the test but she mostly tells you what pages to read. I love going to her class!
She is so inspirational!! I love listening to her lectures because she is so interesting and I actually learned a lot. Highly recommend her.
Professor Edens is a GEM. She is passionate about the course material, and it shows in every lecture. (She's funny too!) You have to attend class if you want to get an A, but she makes each unit so interesting that you really will want to be there. Attend class, take detailed notes for exams, and you'll do well. I would take her again if I could!
Pammy is the best professor I've had at A&amp;M. She is hilarious and her lectures are so interesting that I always wanted to go to class. The tests can be pretty tricky, and you absolutely have to read the text book. She gives weekly quizzes to help boost your grade, but she literally gives you the answers so its not hard at all. Seriously love her!
She gives amazing lectures that are very interesting and she tells funny anecdotes for the class. She also tells you a lot what she will definitely test on. I ended up barely getting an A in the class, after not doing well on the first test. You HAVE to read the book. She also gave some extra credit which helped a lot, but only on Fridays.
I started this class a week behind due to add/drop and I feared that I wouldn't catch up. I ended with an A that I worked really hard for, but it wasn't't unattainable. Make sure to read the textbook for exams, and go over her powerpoint from lecture. She is a great prof who cares about her students so much that I am taking her again this fall!!
While shes definitely one of the harder Psyc professors, shes fairly easy and fair. I didnt go to class at all, only for the exams, and I ended up with a C. This is okay for me because I had more pressing classes to go to. However if you plan on skipping class all the time I encourage you to search for another easier prof, if not, shes solid!
An actual angel sent from heaven. She's funny and always willing to help you with whatever concepts she's teaching about. Study for tests, but just pay attention in lecture and you'll get an A. She's funny and going to class was genuinely enjoyable. She's actually the best, take her and you won't regret it!! My favorite prof for sure.
Great prof, tests can be tricky but if you know the material you should be fine. I looked forward to going to class bc the extra credit opportunities and fun lectures. Has kids our age so is very empathetical but at the same time is pretty tough to reach over email so your best bet is to ask any questions you have right after class.
Prof. Edens is great. You will definitely have to work (read, study) if you want an A, but it is do-able. She is very sweet and readily available in office hours if you need anything. A few writing assignments, but super easy if you just follow the rubric. Gives quizzes as well as extra credit randomly in class, so make sure you go! Recommend!!
She is a great professor and really cares about her students. You definitely have to read your textbook and the extra readings or you will not do great on the exams.
Teacher name: McInnis, Verity
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She cares about you learning how to study, and offers assistance on figuring out a study strategy for you. There is no textbook, but there are 4 small books to read that aren't too bad. Quizzes on each book, with questions about them on the exams. Lectures are structured like she's telling a narrative and she keeps them interesting. Not date heavy
Test come straight from lecture notes, quizzes straight from books. I read none of the books and was able to make B's on the quizzes. Not many grades other than quizzes and test so prepare for that. As long as you obtain the notes from lecture, you'll be fine.
Very good lectures. I'll take her again if I need history
Really straightforward profesor. She genuinely cares about her students and always reminds them of when tests/quizzes are coming up. As long as you attend the lectures and write more than just is what is on her PowerPoints you will do well. Her tests and quizzes are all multiple choice. Tests were slightly easier than quizzes.
Dr. McInnis has THE BEST accent! She makes listening to history fun and engaging. Tests are a little specific but if you take detailed notes and study it hard, you'll be fine!
Sweet professor that offers extra credit, doesn't go too fast in lecture, and helps students who seeks assistance during her office hours. As per the standard of most history classes, be careful about your grades-- if you mess up one exam, you're probably boned. Be sure to read the assigned books as well-- SparkNotes can only help you so much.
Basic lecture heavy class. Not easy, but an easy A/B if you simply come to class, listen, and take notes. Pretty run of the mill difficulty for a school like TAMU. About what you would expect from a required core class. Shes a super sweet lady, lectures are entertaining, and is always available to help outside of class. Definitely would recommend!
I made a mistake and believed everything I read on the internet. Do not take this course if you aren't prepared to listen and write non stop every class for 50 minutes straight. She has little to no grades which really will put you in a bind if you perform badly on one of the exams being that there are only 3 exams. Sweet lady but tests are tough):
I've never been in a history class where I didn't have to write a single paper. Trust me I've never wanted to write an essay so bad. She comes to class, lectures, and that's it. She does the bare minimum. Test are all multiple choice, mostly t/f and each test comes with about 20pgs of notes. You must know all the notes bc it all will be on the test
She lectures a lot of content, so for your exams you will have around 20 pages of notes. For the tests you really need to know all the specifics of the notes. The end of semester paper is a pain and she grades really harshly so make sure you get good grades on everything else. She takes attendance every class and is worth a 1% per absence.
I honestly hate history and Dr. McInnis made it so much more enjoyable. Her lectures were engaging, and she used a variety of mediums to convey information: audio, visual, etc. She really cares about her students' success. However, her tests are quite specific, so you have to work for your grade. Definitely take her!
If you love history, I would not recommend because I didn''t see her inspiring students. She just comes to class and talk. If you just have to take the class, wouldn't recommend neither. Too much reading, you will not know what to study for her exams. Study from notes? it's ridiculous how people go to class and write down and memorize every lecture
Her lectures are so boring. History is much more interesting than that!! Everybody in my class wrote down every single word she says. Idk why people can learn history this way. You have to read four books and most of them are boring. There will be 10 questions she pulls from those 200-page books. Exams are lecture heavy. DO NOT RECOMMEND
Prof. McInnis is incredible! Her upper level history class was an even mixture of lecture and group discussion and she made the criteria and expectations for the class clear. She gives good honest feedback on your writing and doesn't just hand out grades, she requires clear analysis and developed thesis'. I would definitely take her again!!!!
Prof. McInnis is an entirely lecture-based teacher. If you skip class you will miss too much and won't do well. However, if you go to class, pay attention, and take good notes, you can easily rock it. You have to read a couple books throughout the semester, but they're easy reads and pretty interesting. Loved her!
Attendance was not mandatory but exams are from lecture. There is no review so you pretty much have to remember everything she said in lecture, which is a lot. She talked very fast so taking notes was hard. My class had a group google docs that people contributed their notes too which was helpful if you missed lecture or if you wanted to compare.
This is a GREAT prof!! She is adorable. She has a British accent, but it is easy to understand. The tests are based on the lecture so you need to go, and take good notes. She makes history easy to understand, and her book choices are really interesting. If you don't have time to read you can study sparknotes and pass, but dont expect to get a 100
Had 4 books &amp; had 4 quizzes, with no time to read the book. The tests were terrible &amp; with heavy studying there is so much info on each test you can't memorize it all. She talks for the whole damn class &amp; I would have 10 pages of notes per class. She is so boring!!! The tests were hard because she words things confusingly. DO NOT TAKE
Very sweet and clearly cares but the 4 books that are required reading with quizzes based on them count for far too much. I got high A's on all the tests but did not do as well on the quizzes (even though I read the books) and as a result I ended with a B. She is an amazing lecturer and even though history is not my thing I enjoyed her class!
Dr. McInnis is a great professor. I took her this semester and I liked her allot. Her lectures are really specific, there's no textbook use so you must attend all lectures to do good in the class. Beware she talks really fast and her exams are really specific. Overall, she'll be the best HIST professor to get here!!
Teacher name: Tag, Andrew
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Tag's love of biology is obvious as he's a "self-professed nerd". He isn't only passionate about the subject, but he is passionate about teaching, which can't be said for most professors in the science department who just want to be able to research. He tells great dad jokes and makes the subject interesting enough. The lab is very hard though.
Let me start off by saying I was advised me to take tag because he was a good professor. I respectfully disagree hes teaching skills are terrible, his exams a ridiculous difficult in comparison to other professors. I honestly regret taking his class. Honestly youre better off taking Hawkins or someone else. P.S the lab in this class is ridiculous
Dr. Tag is definitely the prof you need to take for Bio 111. He does go through slides pretty fast but he's interesting to listen to. My biggest advice is BUY AN A-PLUS SEASON PASS! It was the BEST way to study for this class. Tag's class is hard but he's approachable and gives LC as extra credit so try not to skip class often!
Be ready to study if you take Tag. You definitely have to work for a decent grade. He gives some extra credit and I would not recommend skipping class. He goes over slides in class extremely fast but does post them. Homework isn't too heavy and S.I. sessions help a ton!! Tests aren't easy but if you study, you should be fine.
Dr. Tag is a great choice for biology 111. I will be taking him for 112 as well. This was not an easy class and you definitely have to work for it, but getting an A is not impossible. If I am being honest, I never read the textbook and just went to A+ tutoring and got a season pass. I just studied that stuff and got an A in the class.
Dr. Tag is an awesome prof. Definitely not an easy course, but he tries to make it enjoyable. He posts practice exams that look similar to the test and uses learning catalytics as a way to earn points so def go to class. Homework is very easy. About 8-10 question on a problem assigned each week.
Dr. Tag was a decent prof. This class is not easy but he is very knowledgeable. He definitely holds you accountable for listening to his lectures, attending class, and putting in outside work- he doesn't make it easy. Although I am not taking him again for BIO 112 he is not a bad professor and I would not mind taking him again if necessary.
His tests are not easy by any means, be ready to study and go to every SI available.
Fantastic. Already registered for the next class with Dr. Tag! Very engaging, and cares about his students. Uses in-class questions (LC) for bonus points and posts his slides after each lecture.
Dr. Tag is extremely passionate about Biology and it shows in lecture. As long as you dont cram for tests there is no reason you shouldnt get an A.
He genuinely loves and knows what hes teaching, which makes the lectures easier to bear.
Dr. Tag is a fantastic professor, I am honestly surprised that his scores from others do not reflect this. I took him for 101 and 102, and my only regret is that I cannot take him for any other courses. While he doesn't just give you an A, he doesn't make it overly difficult. He also makes time during office hours to help. Trust me, take Tag!
Love Tag!! His lectures are amazing and actually keep your attention. Im switching majors, but if I wasnt I would take him again! Super sweet guy with lots of extra credit and easy homework. Study for tests though! Especially the study guides he puts online.
Does a lot of extra credit opportunities with learning catalytics, but make sure you show up to class because they're random. I didn't find him very funny, but some people do. He basically just reads off of the powerpoints which come straight from the book, so if you read the chapters you'll do fine on the exams. They're straight from the test bank
Dr. Tag really enjoys what he's teaching and makes his lectures interesting. He does iClicker questions and extra credit in class so make sure you show up. Tests are based a lot off of lecture and the book, but the slides are online. He explains things in a way that's easy to understand, but its a lot of information so study hard.
I had Dr. Tag for BIOL 111/112. He is passionate about what he teaches and is willing to help you learn outside of class. I would take him again in 111 for sure, I had him for his first time teaching 112 and he was still great, just less prepared. Ask good questions, do your homework and study hard over lecture material for tests. I recommend!
Dr. Tag is a great professor and his exams are very fair. He's easy to talk to and willing to work with you. You really have to beware of the lab attached to 111, it can make or break your grade. I had an A in lecture but lab brought my grade down to a C because of my TA being one of the difficult ones.
Dr. Tag is very knowledgeable professor who loves teaching Biology. His tests are straight from his power points which he posts online. Only thing is that there are only HW and test grades in the class so you must do well on the test. Easy B and getting a A takes memorizing the entire slides he posts
Dr. Tag is clearly extremely knowledgeable in his field. He lectures cover everything on the test but be prepared to study. I studied 5x more for the lab in this class than I did for the tests. The lab is what makes this class difficult, otherwise, it was much easier than Bio 111. Honestly, prepare every week for lab and you will get an A.
I had Dr. Tag for both 111 and 112. He never tests on stuff he doesn't go over in lecture. Basically, if you read the textbook, you'll be fine. Andrew is super nice, and his lectures are enjoyable. He has a good sense of humor which makes lectures fun. BIOL 111 was super easy compared to 112, but I would definitely recommend Tag.
Teacher name: Allen, Angela
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Allen is GREAT! Her class is really hard if you haven't taken any kind of calc before, but she cares so much about her students and is a really good teacher. Go to her week in reviews and office hours.
Not sure why all these bad reviews are here. I'm not good at math but Dr. Allen is an honest gem, she's SO caring. This is a hard class but she helps you so much. DO THE WIR THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE TEST (difficulty wise, some problems are pulled from there too!!) Office hours saved my life with the class also! TAKE HER SHE'S SO HELPFUL AND KIND! :)
Angela Allen is a great math professor, but this is the hardest class I've ever taken. I've never cried so much over homework. This class took a small part of me with it that I will never get back. I pulled all-nighters for every single test, yet somehow managed to fail 2/3 tests. But with the help of some curving I think I ended up with a B.
Professor Allen is the best professor I've ever had. She truly cares about each one of her students and wants you to get the highest grade possible. I've never been good at math and this class is not the easiest, but she explains everything super clearly and makes calc seem simple. Go to the Week in review sessions and go to class always!
This class was so hard. I understand that it is calculus and it is going to be hard, but I studied my butt off for all exams exactly the way she told us to and used week in reviews and A Plus and still failed the exams miserably. She does calculus "her way" and has her own rules for how you have to solve her problems.
I love Professor Allen. She actually cares about her students and how they do in the class, which you don't see often. If you go to class/office hours you will get a good grade. Don't fall behind because everything builds off of previous information.
She's a really good teacher I just wish I could have more individual attention from her but her office hours are always booked and I can't make it to most of the TA's office hours. I need extra help because I suck at math but she is a good professor and gives extra credit! Make sure to go to class every time though because of the clicker quizzes.
Took her for the summer and thought she did an amazing job explaining a difficult subject. I had a bad prof for Math 141 and as a result I thought this math was much easier. She's very pleasant and if you do the homework and rework the problems from class, the tests aren't that bad
Professor Allen is a great person on the fact that she cares about her students, but her tests are the worst thing you could think of. There is no correlation between her test and the homework. The test is basically concept questions with difficult test questions. She makes the class like a graduate course. DONT TAKE HER
Hardest class I have ever taken. Even more so than anatomy. She was a great professor but she talks way too fast and uses difficult examples to teach us a new topic every time. Lots of weekly homework that does not relate to the exams. She curves 6-12 pts. Still does not help the fact that the class average was a 58% on the second exam. Q dropped!
She is the best math teacher I have had in a LONG time. She is so sweet curves all of the tests and will even round your grade a bit at the end of the semester. The TA's are very helpful with the homework. This is a hard class but as long as you do what she tells you to study &amp; get help when your confused you should be fine.
This lady is SO SWEET and really cares for students. I struggled through this class. I hired a tutor and begged her for help multiple times. This subject is hard in general so you should at least help yourself by taking her. Many people made easy A's, but the subject can be more difficult for non-math people. Tests were harder than the homework.
Hardest class ever. But, She's the best Prof. I've ever had. She's very nice and will be completely honest. She's more of a friend than a professor.
Very sweet professor and makes an effort to get to know the students, yet during class no questions are really asked towards the students. Exams are highly difficult you must study study study study for them. Webassign homework helps, but she suggests reworking class questions as better practice for exams. Final replaces lowest test grade.
Prof. Allen is one of the best profs Ive taken at A&amp;M! Super helpful if you have questions, and works through the material on a step by step basis to help everyone understand. More than willing to help struggling students outside of class. Truly sweet lady who cares deeply about her students. Her summer class can move fast but its very worth it!
I took pre-calculus junior year of high school, so it had literally been 4 years since I'd been exposed to calculus. This class was difficult, but I was in her office hours twice a week which SAVED ME. After curves, I made a C, B, C in order of exam. The curves ranged from 6 to 12 points. Final replaced lowest exam and this saved me bc I made an A!
I found this class to be extremely easy with no calculus background. She curves every test and the tests are honestly not that difficult, just concept heavy. Go to office hours if you need help. Allen is extremely helpful and caring. If you put in time to study, an A is not unheard of.
I love Prof. Allen! She is so nice, but nice doesn't get you the grade. You will have to put in the work. I am pretty good at math but I didn't study like I should have, yikes. Tests were really not that bad you just really have to put in the work. I lived at TA tutoring and study hub tutoring. They help so much with homework and faster than alone.
Dr. Allen is a great professor. She seems to genuinely care about how the students do and is willing to offer a ton of help to improve grades. As long as you print out the lecture notes, show up, and do the homework, you'll walk away with at least a B. The final was very fair and replaced the lowest of the 3 exam grades.
I typically do well in math classes. This class was harder than previous I've taken at A&amp;M, but I assumed it would be since it's calculus. Allen's tests are concept heavy, but she tells you before the test what to be prepared for and is very, very generous with extra credit. If you have the option to take her, I recommend it.
Teacher name: Creasy, Rebecca
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Creasy is possible the best prof TAMU has. She is passionate about nutrition and so caring about all of her students. Not only is her class incredibly easy, she is just a sweet person who really wants to help you learn. I was in a car accident during the semester and she was patient with me and helped me get back on track. 10/10 recommend her.
Very easy class. Quizzes are open notes with multiple attempts. All discussion posts and projects are pretty straightforwards just make sure to look at the rubrics for everything. Tests are exactly like reviews and take questions from quizzes. Tons of extra credit available. Online tests require online proctoring. Should be easy A.
Dr. Creasy is the BEST! Food Processing is the best class I have yet to take at TAMU (I'm a food science nerd), but she really cares. She is so sweet, and genuinely wants you to do well. I learned so much, and was never super stressed about anything, which is a great combo. If you can take her, I would, and I'm sad I won't be in her class anymore.
I love Dr. Creasy! I have never had a prof that cared about their students more than she did. Her test are not that hard at all, just study the quizzes and the study guide she posts and you'll be good. She will definetly work with you if something comes up so don' tbe afraid to email her. 100% would recommend her to anyone!
Dr. Creasy is awesome. She has such a passion for nutrition which really makes the class interesting. I took Nutrition with her online, and it was harder than I thought it would be, but if you do the work it will show. It definitely wasn't a blow off class for me but she gives you all the elements you need to succeed. ONLINE TESTS ARE PROCTORED!!!
Dr. Creasy is super sweet and really cares about her students. The class was super easy as long as you read the rubrics for all assignments and read all of the powerpoints ( you don't have to listen to the videos). She gives a ton of extra credit opportunities and the tests are identical to the reviews. Quizzes are open note - basically an easy A.
Dr. Creasy is an angel, a complete gem. Not only is the class easy as heck but she cares SO much for her students. The class consists of easy weekly assignments, 2 projects, and 3 tests. Ngl, never studied for the tests made a 59, 70, &amp; 75. Still made an A in the class. She gives out 25 points worth of extra credit. 10/10 recommend this class!
Extremely nice prof!! Discussion posts and quizzes (3 attempts) are so easy, so many free points. 3 exams and no final. In person and online exam (proctored). Her lectures are in listening modules and she posts the ppt. You have to study for the exam though, you have to know your stuff to get A's on the exam. Extra credit too!
This is the best and most caring lady you could get! Her online class is very easy and will help you learn a lot! She makes sure you understand things and is very reasonable!!!
I couldn't possibly sum up how amazing this woman is in 350 characters. She is so understanding and genuinely cares about you and your grade. She is willing to meet on the weekends and past normal business hours in order to make sure you succeed. She is THE BEST person and professor I have ever had! 1000% would take her again!
I LOVED HER. Dr. Creasy is so nice and caring. She gave great lectures and notes. The class isnt a super easy A, her tests were not easy but she gave a study guide. Memorize it and you can get an A/B+. You have to go to class for fill in notes and clicker questions. Lots of extra credit and easy projects give you a good chance of an A.
Dr. Creasy was absolutely splendid! Took the summer class for a GPA booster, and it was just that. Had five quizzes that you could retake 3 times to get 100%, a few projects that required some work &amp; three exams identical to reviews. I came to meet her, and I spent almost two hours conversing w/ her about all things nutrition. Definitely recommend!
She's probably the nicest person in the world. So... yeah.
Dr. Creasy is the absolute sweetest professor I have ever had. I took this as a GPA booster &amp; that's exactly what it was. Super easy class if you put in minimum effort- a few quizzes, a few fairly easy projects, and 3 or 4 exams that you will pass if you study the hour before. Exams are proctored so no cheating. Lots of extra credit opportunities.
I LOVED DR. CREASY!! She loves what she does and her students! She gives a lot of extra credit so that helps. Start the diet analysis project early. She gives a lot of good feedback and responds to emails quickly.
This class was definitely an easy A. You can take the quizzes 3 different times so a 100 was easy. Discussion post and projects were graded easily and were basically a competition grade. Test were pretty hard but I made a B on all of them and still finished with a high A. She really cares about her students and gives lots of EC, TAKE THIS CLASS!
I LOVED this class. I took it online while i was in Europe and made an A. She really worked with her students and gave us an extra extra credit projects to help the grades. Quizzes were an easy 100 because you could retake the same quiz 3 times. The tests were a little tough, someone watches you. study for tests and do the exam review!!
Very manageable class if you put forth the effort. Best elective I've taken so far and solidified my interest in nutrition.
SOO caring and helpful. Gives extra credit and the homework outside of class is SO doable. I took this online, so my tests were proctored, but she gives you a study guide and the test is similar to those questions! I needed a 36% on the final to keep my A. She is so kind and understanding!! Take this class!!
tests are kinda hard, but it doesn't matter considering how many (extrmely easy) quizzes and weekly discussion posts you have to do. I needed a 35 on the final to get an A. TAKE THIS CLASS!
Teacher name: Prout, Erik
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Prout is hilarious and interesting. His lectures can be boring at times but go to class bc he wont post any of his slides. You dont need to do very well on the tests bc there are massive amounts of extra credit with the homework. SI sessions are a lifesaver before tests. Theres not too much reading and he drops the lowest exam grade. Good class!
Dr. Prout is a great prof. Geography of Texas was a really fun class, that was interesting and super easy as long as you took notes, paid attention, and turned things in.
His lectures resemble a very long story that never has a point and are so conversational you sometimes miss the information, but a lot of his questions come from the lecture and mastering geography so pay attention in lecture and do the mastering geography homework. Attend SI and you will be golden.
This was a great class! If you read the book, go to class, and look at the maps you should get an A. The project is fun and easy, its also a good grade booster!
Dr. Prout is a decent professor. He makes a lot of jokes and he tries to keep the class engaged. S.I. Sessions will save you in this class!! I didn't take a lot of notes and still ended with an A. If you put in some effort, you can make a decent grade. He gives lots of extra credit in the homework which helps a lot. Decent class, decent professor.
He's very passionate about geo but does not teach well. I personally never read the textbook, but a lot of his questions are super specific and from the book. Tests were pretty hard, you really need to study the maps. I went to a lot of the SI's and it helped SO MUCH, highly recommend. Homework every week, I would split work up over 3-5 days.
I showed up to every class, but if it werent for SI, I wouldn't have passed. Dr. Prout is passionate about geography, but he doesn't really tell you where countries are on maps... I figured it out from SI and test reviews. Exams were very hard, honestly I'm not sure how i did good on them. He uses random facts for questions that were not in book
I loved GEOG 305, taken for my ICD culture credit. The book is written by him so read it and use it, work hard on the project, and study hard for the tests and you will do fine. He is passionate about the subject and I enjoyed lectures, I learned a lot. He was very available for help outside of class (looking over tests). Definitely recommend!!
This class wasn't too difficult, but the test questions are extremely specific. Half of the questions are from lectures and the book, and the other half covers maps from the book. I felt the landscape project was graded pretty easy and was the main reason I was able to get a B in this class. Studying the maps harder would've gotten me an A
Do not take this professor. He doesnt answer emails, very unprofessional. Is not helpful at all. Takes forever to put grade in the grade book. Tests are so detailed &amp; specific. One of the worst professors Ive had at TAMU.
Nice prof. Stays after class if anyone has questions. He's very passionate/knowledgeable on geography, which resulted in a lot of random rambling during lecture. He has dry humor &amp; cracks jokes that often went over the class' head. All the homework is online, but plenty of extra credit. 3 exams &amp; final, but he drops the lowest test score
Go to class, and make sure to read the textbook! The textbook is very dense, but if you space out the reading you can get it all done. Make sure to attend lecture because Dr. Prout likes to pull little irrelevant information from the lecture and put it on the test. The most important thing to attend is SI it will be your saving grace!
Dr. Prout is pretty good at giving lectures, but listen closely. He sometimes throws random stuff that he's said on to tests. Also, if you're not good at remembering online homework, this probably isn't the class for you. It's tedious, but boosts your grade. If you're bad at memorizing maps, this will be a challenge. The SI sessions saved me.
unnecessary hard tests. You have to know every detail in the textbook reading. If you want an A you have to go to every lecture, read the textbook with heavy notes, and ALOT of studying. LOTS of homework. homework is annoying and takes forever. extra credit saves you. i got 75, 60, 50 for 1st 3 exams. 76 final. ended w/ B. get 300/250 on hw to help
He is not the best professor, but I would take him again. An easy C, if you do not put much effort. An okay B, if you put some effort. For an A you have to definitely work for it. Going to class is kind of pointless. Go to SI sessions, they are so helpful. Do the extra credit!! Overall, he is actually really nice when it comes to grading.
Dr. Prout is a ridiculous and incredibly boring human being. his lectures are vague and he's super quiet so sit in the front to try and hear him whisper awful jokes that no one ever gets. He makes this course way harder than it needs to be and is rude during office hours. Read the book and know where everything is for the unnecessarily hard exams
Dr. Prout is like most professors, he lectures and prepares you for his exams. You really have to go to the SI and study his mastering homework if you want to get an A in the exam. As long as you read and go to his SI for reviews before the test you will be fine and surely get an A.
Lectures are pretty boring and long. I took this as an afternoon class at 4:15 which was my first mistake. I often found myself trying to stay awake during lectures. His tests are kind of all over the place and most questions are about his lectures. Make sure to study the maps before the test as well.
Prout's tests are lecture heavy, so I would say attending class is necessary. SI is very helpful-worksheets and test reviews every week. Online Mastering Geography homework is time consuming, but he gives you opportunities for extra credit on it also. 3 out of 4 test count, final is mandatory.
Dont take him if you dont have to Lectures are boring , he doesnt respond to emails, he is so cheesy its cringy, you will have to go to SI to pass, tons of extra credit, the tests are ridiculous they are tested over general knowledge (his own words) , its easy to get an A, but you have to put so much time into this class
Teacher name: Orchard, Patric
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I'm surprised that Patrick got so many low ratings because I personally loved him as a Prof. He is consistent in grading &amp; responsible for handing work back in a timely manner. He also is very thorough in lectures &amp; teaches you even how to use your calculator. He is also pretty funny &amp; quirky so that keeps it interesting. Want to take again for 142
Professor Orchard is a little awkward, making it difficult for some students to understand. However, the class material is very easy (first unit is hs freshman level math), so it should not be too bad. . Show up to class because of pop quizzes (some of which are class/open note quizzes). He is sweet and puts book/game references in examples.
Out of all the profs, Patrick is the best option. He teaches much better than others and cracks a few jokes here and there. This class isn't extremely difficult but I did not do as well as I thought I would have. He can get boring so sometimes it is hard to stay awake but he is easily accessible outside of class.
I am not usually very good at math, but he made it easy to understand. He is constantly making sure everyone understands what he has just taught. There are a lot of quizzes DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THESE!!!! I would have had an A instead of a B if I had studied more for his quizzes. Super nice guy who cares about his students!
Prof. Orchard a great lecturer, and I recommend going to class. I'm not the worst at math, but I thought I could just study for 2 days before the test and be okay, but if you want an A you gotta study for a week, and every test counts!! One bad test grade will effect your final grade. The final reviews alone isn't enough, study the hw!
He's a cool guy. I would recommend
I really enjoyed Patrick! He is well spoken throughout his lectures and gives great ways to study(Week-End Reviews). He has weekend reviews every week on Tuesdays and I highly recommend doing them before every test to study. Overall he gives you everything you need to get a good grade and I highly recommend him as a professor.
Prof Orchard is best in office hours, he teaches all on the board and works through examples, and doesn't give much else. He does offer tutoring sessions on Tuesday's HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to those, he does replace the lowest test w the final, and you have weekly HW/quizzes. I had a really hard time in this class and really had to work for it.
Mr. Orchard is honestly an amazing professor. His communication in lecture is so clear and understandable. He never condescends questions and offers a Week in Review that covers material learned within the past week. My friends that had another professor went to his week in review and it helped them so much! Definitely take him if you can!!!
Mr. Orchard wasn't the best teacher, but he definitely cares and will answer as many questions as he can in class. He is honestly a really nice person and is a huge nerd, which makes for a lot of laughs. The class, in general, isn't too bad, especially if you've taken stats before. Go to the week in review sessions they help a ton!
This class truly taught me that the professor does matter!! Although he is nice and seems like a cool person-he does not know how to explain the math well. He likes to give lots of definitions, which for me, in math does not help. Easy class but hard prof... Final is coming up... trying to teach myself everything &amp; still wondering if Ill pass :(
Not very good at explaining material, if you are good at math, you have a good chance. However, if you struggle with math even a little bit, Patrick Orchard is not for you. He can be very difficult to understand and doesn't know how to answer questions.
Mr. Orchard is funny, but not a good teacher. I'm good at math so I didn't have many problems, but he is terrible at explaining things. Would not recommend if you struggle with math. Also lots of pop quizzes, but not too hard.
He knows his material inside and out, explains well, answers questions, re explains to make topics more clear, and genuinely wants his students to understand the material. He knows how to relate each section to life. it's not an easy A class, but if you work hard and utilize your resources you will be fine.
Mr. Orchard is a great prof. He goes through things very slowly and provides so many ways to get extra help. He is a little awkward, but it sorta makes him funny and relatable. Definitely take him for Math 141
He does not teach effectively at all. He clearly understands the material, but can't explain it and is rude if people ask questions. He is sort of awkward and quiet. I recommend taking someone else.
Dr. Orchard is one of the best professors I've had. He explained things clearly and provided example problems and test reviews that are very similar to whats on the test. Online homework is easy and allows lots of attempts. He is funny and makes lots of jokes during lecture. If you have a math brain this will be a very easy class for you.
I am terrible at math. I was told that this class was pretty easy, however it was awful. If you're okay or good at math you will be fine, just don't forget the weekly homework. ATTEND 4.0 AND GO IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE. 4.0 is the only reason I managed to pass this class. He tries to be funny but he is pretty monotone. Doesn't check attendance
Awesome prof. Holds seemingly endless channels of help (help desk hours, office hours, and week in reviews) that are a must to go to because they allow you to see material over and over again. Funny humor gets you through the approx. 1.5 hr lecture. Recommend going to class but if you are okay with getting a B or not putting effort notes are online
If you took higher-level math classes in high school or at least have a pretty solid background in math, this class should be super easy! I was able to skate by with a pretty low amount of effort. He really does care that everyone is learning in the class and the tests are fair. He has a quirky sense of humor so class itself is also kind of fun.
Teacher name: Swim, Keith
School name: Texas A&amp;M University at College Station
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Swim is a great professor overall His tests are pretty challenging overall but fair You need to read the book and the study guides he provides on top of watching his online lectures Nothing really important in the lectures but you have to go take quizzes that are worth 20 percent I would take again but not for those looking for an easy A
Swim is a great lecturer with hard tests. This course definitely requires A LOT of studying, but there is no daily work, so that is all you have to pay attention to. Best advice is don't get behind because its hard to catch up. Didn't really get anything out of going to class but you gotta go for the quizzes. Just read the study guide, not the book
Hard as heck, a very smart guy though. Lots of lectures and you have to go to class in order to actually learn. He is the final boss of Mays.
This was the hardest class I have ever taken, and I'm pretty sure it will be the hardest class I will ever take. He does not seem interested in students doing well and if you ask questions he gets angry. You have to read to do well on the exams and study for days. Memorize minute details that seem unimportant, and you might do well.
test grades were 76,84,71,90 (final idk) and still made an A. Never went to 4.0 &amp; Go! simply read the book, watched ALL the lecture videos (2-3x), used the study guide (CRUCIAL), and used quizlet to help practice vocab and court cases. Go in after every test and see what you did wrong bc you WILL see those ?s again on the final. KEEP UP W THE CLASS
This class has quite the reputation and definitely deserves it. My strategy for this class was to first take notes over his transcript lectures and then go through the textbook, making flashcards from both my notes and the textbook material. Using this strategy I was able to make 95, 94, 90, 74 on exams. Space out the work and DO NOT FALL BEHIND!!
Swim is a very knowledgable prof but also very hard. Tests are made to make you really think and trip you up. There are weekly quizzes that he gives 8-10 minutes for. Passing this class is very attainable as I got a 72, 73, 74 and 80 on the tests but ended with a B in the class.
Not the right professor to be teaching an intro course. Is knowledgeable in the material, but terrible teaching it and very jerkish. Tests are very specific and the only way of passing is memorizing the textbook (with multiple errors and false answers). The quizzes are 35 questions in 8 minutes. Our test avg was 52 each time. I had a 4.0 prior
Swim is a good man, a good Aggie, and a strong Professor. Class isn't mandatory but you need to go to take a quiz. He gets a bad rap for being tough, but if you LISTEN TO LECTURES, DO THE BOOK STUDY GUIDE, and really put in the proper amount of work, you can get an A (or high B). The business info is truly valuable; work hard and you'll be okay.
Swim's class is very difficult. I enjoyed it, but it's easily the hardest class I've ever taken. You need to go to class and also watch his lectures online, read the book, and his study guide, and review your notes constantly. Most of his test questions are "a and b" "b and c" "all of the above" "none of the above".
Just no. I ended up dropping this class. Overall, he is a good professor but this class requires a ton of work. Do not take this class if you already have a heavy course load.
Swim's class is tough and requires a lot of work outside of class, but it's doable. Bring the study guide to class &amp; add lecture notes to it &amp; listen to online lectures as much as possible. Read over your notes frequently and don't get behind. Tests are very detailed. Swim is very helpful in office hours and cares about students so get to know him!
Keith Swim's class is by FAR the hardest class I've ever taken in my life. I q-dropped the class right before the deadline because there was no way to pass, even though I studied SO much for each tests. DONT TAKE WITH HIM IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. He's a great professor and really cares about his students, but the class is so unbelievably hard.
Swim's class is definitely tough but I think is a super awesome guy who really cares about the materials. You have to go class to take quizzes that are pretty necessary to pass the class and I did the study guide and reading to get ready for the test. But he curves the class and each test. I got C's and D's on the test and made a B in the class.
Swim isn't a bad guy, his class is just super tough. You will read pretty much the whole textbook so get going on it now. Study A LOT for the exams and you'll do alright. It really just takes a lot of your time and even more effort.
He's not nearly as bad as people say. I got a high B and this class is what made me realize I wanted to go to law school. It's HARD, no doubt about it, but if you read the book, go to class, and actively try to understand the material, you'll be fine. You just can't expect to do half the work and get a good grade. You just have to put in the work.
Swim is tough, no sugar coating it. I got a B in my second try taking this class and this is easily a top 3 toughest class ive ever taken. You must read the textbook cover to cover and attend all lectures because he randomly assigns pop quizzes. However he does curve the class after the Q drop deadline.
Okay, so this course and professor is awful. In all honesty, if you are able to you should transfer this course from Blinn. His lectures and the textbook (that he wrote) do not correlate with the exam questions, they just kind of focus on the same BROAD ideas. Basically, to do well you must devote your life to his course. Good Luck lol
Swim is exactly what his reputation made me think he was- a great prof that teaches a really challenging class. Go to every class, read the textbook cover to cover, rewatch his lectures, &amp; do the questions in the study guide. 4.0 really helped. Very tough class, but it was interesting. Go to office hours &amp; get to know him &amp; he'll probably curve you
This class requires lots of reading and note taking by yourself since it is a lot of content and we had lectures once a week only. We had tricky T/F quizzes every class. Tests were multiple choice, but hard. Course based only on quizzes, 4 tests and a cumulative final.
Teacher name: Zellmer, Robert
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Possibly the worst professor I had in college. He is clearly into himself and chemistry more than he is in helping people understand the material. I went to his office hours to get help and he told me i was too stupid to pass the class and should consider switching majors from engineering to education or something. Not a nice guy
God awful teacher. Not clear and clearly doesnt care about his students well-being. Take anyone else.
Chem 1250 is extremely difficult but I guess it's not entirely Zellmer's fault that the class is so hard. He gives you plenty of practice material but you cannot fall behind. His exams are difficult and you need to go really fast to finish all the problems on them. Also, he wears a mic during lecture and it feels he is yelling at you for an hour.
1250 was definitely one of the toughest classes I've taken at OSU, but it would have been a whole lot worse without a professor like Zellmer. He cares a ton about his student's success; he holds helpful review sessions before tests, sends emails out all the time with help, and is very accessible with office hours. Tough class, great professor.
Dr. Zellmer is in a tough position. The 1250 class covers 20 chapters in a single semester, but that's not his fault. Zellmer though makes the best out of the situation. He provides every resource necessary to succeed (lecture notes, hw problems, practice tests), so its really about whether or not you're prepared to put in the work to succeed.
While Zellmer is known to be the hardest professor for the General Chemistry sequence, he truly respects and helps his students succeed. His notes are outstanding and will go out of his way at midnight to send emails to the entire class and to individuals who have questions. Do not fall behind - there is a lot of material to understand.
Tough but fair. He provides a lot of practice material for exams and quizzes.
Zellmer does not have a good reputation, but he does care about his students. He clearly spends a lot of time on his lectures and makes sure he is available for office hours. His exams are extremely difficult as they require a very deep understanding of the material and he expects a lot from students. Get ready for 10-15 emails a day from him.
Zellmer is by far the hardest professor I have ever had, but it is not because he is teaching wrong material like other professors in the chem department at OSU. I am retaking chem1220 in the SU and his exams are harder because they are not standardized like during AU and SP semester. I would not want another professor because hes that smart/good.
You can't simply 'learn' material. Be ready to apply it and have a deep understanding of it in order to do well.
Zellmer deserves the reputation he's given. That doesn't mean he is a bad teacher, but make sure to go to class and study pretty much everyday, even if its for an hour. Definitely go to his "how to study" classes. There's a pretty good curve (10 points overall), so just do above average on midterms and ace your lab reports and you should be fine.
The best professor I have ever had. His class is tough, but he cares a lot about his students and is so passionate about the subject he teaches. He is so knowledgeable and an extremely hard working professor; His hard work made me want to work even harder. He is always available, day and night, to help his students with any problems.
When you sign up for Zellmer's 1250 class, you might also want to open up amazon and buy a bottle of lube to apply before each lab, quiz, and midterm. This class moves so fast they should install seatbelts on the chairs in the lecture hall. Is this class possible? Yes. Just be ready to have zero free time. Social life? HA! forget about it. Avoid.
Constantly uses midnight emails to send out important course information; grades lab reports using outdated website
Bad things: Recommended homework is impossible to get finished. The weekly quizzes are graded very hard. Weed-out course with a high level of commitment. Good things: He cares about you learning. He gives EXCELLENT premidterm reviews. You will learn a lot because you will need to in order to pass. Responds to emails immediately. Scary smart prof.
Chem II is a difficult class, but professor Zellmer explains the content in a clear, understandable, manner. He uses a lot of slides in his class and all of them are available for students online to look at or follow along, as desired. He seems to care about the material and student achievement.
I took AP CHEM in high school and greatly helped me. You definitely dont need it to succeed. I was able to skip lectures, although I dont recommend it. Learn how to take his tests, dont learn his content. Hes well informed and loves chemistry. I learned how the tests work and finessed my way thru. My 91.38 turned out to be an A (4.0).
Dr. Zellmer is a good professor. People complain because the class is hard, and it is because of the fact that it's Chemistry 1 and a majority of 2 combined in one semester. If you keep up with homework assignments, as well as go to lectures and office hours, you should be fine. You don't need to have taken AP Chem to take this class.
All tests are hard and averages are about 60 to 70. While he is a really a smart and nice guy. Tons of emails every week. I tried to send him emails later than 1 am before exams and he replied in 15 minutes. I am reviewing the final exam tomorrow and writing my comments. Will take his class again next semester and have enrolled in.
He sent like 30 emails before school started. He will continue to send lots of emails. He will challenge you to study on your own by making the tests really difficult. Great weed out class. He's really helpful if you go to office hours and he's really nice if you get to know him. Don't judge him by the difficult of the class :)
Teacher name: Bartoszek-Loza, Rosemary
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I like Dr. Loza as a person, but her lectures are boring and hard to follow. Her quizzes are pretty fair if you do your homework, but she has no control over content on exams and doesn't really prepare us well for them. Loza's sections have the lowest exam averages. Thankfully, she is very accessible during office hours to help explain concepts.
I learned more about her life in the course than I did actual chemistry. She spends lectures wasting time however she can. I do not recommend taking her class.
I hated this class with my whole heart. Made my freshman year miserable. So much homework that was extremely overwhelming. There are weekly quizzes that are literally horrible. 0/10 class.. do not recommend to anyone.
If you dont have time to devoted your entire life to chemistry dont take it with her. The amount of homework she assigns is ridiculous.
Loza is funny, caring and truly wants her students to do well. Unfortunately, her lectures dont promote students success on common midterms. She often makes mistakes in lecture and gives a ridiculous amount of homeworkway more than other Chem 1210 professors. She also gives quizzes while other classes do activities and receive full credit.
Loza was very easy to pay attention to, however she was not the best at explain concepts in detail that are needed on the exams.
Lots of homework on Mastering Chem, but there are many mistakes on it. She attempted to explain these errors but ended up making it more complicated. Recommend only taking this class if your other classes do not require lots of work.
Dr loza made chemistry a blast and was always super willing to help out in office hours. If you work hard for the grade you want it's a great class.
Loza is a funny professor but she does not cover the material well and easily gets sidetracked by bragging.. Be prepared to read the textbook for every single chapter. She is also the only 1210 prof at OSU that gives weekly quizzes in recitation, and these WILL hurt your grade. I like her as a person, but she is not the best professor.
There is no point to going to lecture because you won't get anything out of it. She jumps from topic to topic so quickly that she doesn't explain everything you need to know and I'm not sure she ever knows what she's talking about. Excessive amount of unhelpful homework. Weekly quizzes instead of recitation points. Highly do not recommend.
She gave us tons of homeworks to do, and she talks so fast during the lecture, do not take her class.
Class average was 60% on every exam, enough said
I would take her again if I had the choice. She may make mistakes in lecture, and there is a lot of homework outside of class, but working through those mistakes and the homework made me earn my grade. I believe that she does a great job of setting her students up for future success. Could easily make a drinking game out of the things she says.
Loza is one of the worst the chem department has to offer in terms of coherence and understandability. She's definitely smart, but she should stick to industry. She's the most erratic and incomprehensible lecturer I've seen, and her exams are hard. Study the book on your own, take someone else.
Hardest professor I have ever had. Unrealistic amount of work. Be ready to devote 24/7 to this class. However, she is really funny
The biggest mistake of my entire college career was taking Dr. Loza's class freshman year. LITERALLY ANYONE ELSE is better for 1210. If you do get trapped with her, I suggest creating a drinking game each lecture out of her errors made on the board, and random tangents about her time in industry and own C in Gen Chem. Drink will be your own tears.
Loza is definitely a sweet and caring person and you can tell she knows a lot, but honestly, I had no idea what was going on in lecture. It felt like she spent half the lecture telling us what we should be studying in our own time instead of actually teaching material. The textbook saved me
Loza is tough, no way around it. I would strongly recommend reading the book and taking notes before class, otherwise it is hard to follow her lectures. Her exams are very tough as well, mostly because they are really thorough and test on all the little details. However, if you stay diligent on your work, it is not impossible to do well.
This class was the hardest class Ive ever taken but Dr. Loza feels like one of only professors Ive ever had actually care about me. This being the first time I took Chem, I worked hard. The grade I got wasnt great, but I passed and I dont need to retake it. Shes funny and that keeps lectures interesting. Go to office hours and ask questions.
At the time I took the class I thought professor Loza was just fun but just okay at teaching, however, no other teacher I have had has taught me as much as her. This class isn't that easy but she does a good job of preparing you.
Teacher name: Smith, Marc
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Marc is one of the best Professors at OSU, he's organized and gives you the resources you need to be successful. You have to work for an A but if you commit to the class it's possible. TIPS: always watch lecture videos &amp; take notes(he expects you to), know the concepts like the back of your hand for exams, do the optional HW- its the key to an A.
Very challenging course, but if you watch the lecture videos and do well on the quizzes, you can leave with an A. He curves at the end so if you aim for a B, the curve should bump you to an A or A-. Don't slack off and make sure you work in groups to do the quizzes.
Marc Smith makes accounting very easy to understand, even if you aren't that great at math. I've always heard nightmares about this class, but it really isn't too bad. Marc Smith has very helpful and engaging lectures, and there is extra credit on every exam. The exams aren't cumulative, which is nice
He is a really nice guy but he automatically acts like everyone knows accounting! this does not seem like its really for beginners. The exam practices are not like real exam. Way to much info to remember for each exam. Should be more than just one class a week.
Even though the attendance was not mandatory I would recommend attending class. Even with all the notes its just way to much information to remember for each exams. I would understand if he gave us a formula sheet but no we don't get one. The test times are reasonable but I not once finished. Also the practice exams are not like exams!
Mark is one of the best professors I have had at Ohio State. His lectures are very interesting and he provides you with an abundance of resources to prepare for exams. He truly cares for his students and wants you to be comfortable with the material.
The professor teaches lecture pretty well but you need to spend much time to study for the exam. It is pretty hard.
The worst professor in OSU so far. His lecture aren't helpful and except you to come in to class assuming you're already a God Tier Accounting Student.
Most organized class I've ever taken at Ohio State. Holds your attention in lecture for a class that is normally brutal to focus in. If you put in the work and show up to class you get a good grade just from hearing him lecture and speak
He is almost the lowest quality professor I meet in OSU. If you look at the phone, he will say get out or scold you at the class, his class is the only class that can't look at phone in the room. Class is not difficult but he make the class difficult and boring.
Not very helpful. Hard class. Time consuming. Confusing. Unresponsive.
He's great, but the exams are fairly difficult. Here's how to get an A: Go to every recitation, lecture isn't as important tbh. Watch all the modules at some point and write notes. Do the homework after watching each week's modules. Then do the practice exam a day before-ish. You'll get a good grade, you just have to work harder than usual.
Marc Smith is a great professor. If you take this class, attending the in-person recitation will be of great help. He is very energetic and draws a lot of class participation. If you take the time in the class, unlike me, you should get a good grade very easily. Just be careful on exams because there is no partial credit.
The online videos he made do a really good job of explaining the concepts, and then the weekly recitation is helpful as well. I learned a lot, would always recommend to do the homework even though it isn't graded, its helpful in learning the material.
Gives you all the tools you need to succeed in the class. Going in, I was scared because everyone tells you horror stories about this class. Great lecturer and provides you with more than enough help. Lectures can be scary because he calls on random people, but as long as you come prepared, it was a great class that made me really enjoy accounting.
Marc is a great professor, but he is not very nice when going to lecture. He is not chill at all and treats students like 7 year olds, watching whether or not they use their phones. The class is stupidly easy though. Requires about 2 or 3 hours of studying before exams to get an a
I honestly think Marc Smith is one of the greatest professors at Ohio State. He gets torn down because his class is said to be incredibly hard, but he gives you absolutely everything you need to know. I would really recommend going to every class and watching the lectures. This class isn't incredibly hard but keep up with the materials for an A.
I liked this class was because he gave us a huge curve at the end of the semester. There is no other reason. I went into the final with a 67% and ended with a 72%, which he considered a B-.
Marc knows what he's doing, but this class is TOUGH. You HAVE to go to recitation/ problem solving sessions and watch every module if you want to do well on the exams. A lot of accounting is just practice, and he definitely gives the opportunity to do so, just make sure you show up, watch the modules, and practice the concepts outside of class.
I feel like he doesn't even know what he's talking about. He gets his own homework problems wrong in office hours, and with him, there is no such thing as a formula sheet, so we have to memorize 1000 formulas for each exam. The only grades are 3 exams and 5 quizzes, all or nothing grades. It seems like my entire class is not doing well.
Teacher name: Yao, Steve
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Steve yao is by far my inspiration. Coming out of high school, I never valued my learning, and thought of it as boring and redundant. Steve has changed my entire perspective on the value of education. His inspirational and hilarious lectures have allowed me to fully appreciate all that this great university has to offer. Best professor, no doubt.
The best math teacher anyons one could have
Steve Yao is an awesome dance teacher!
Great prof, easy class.  Definitely take if you are interested in learning how to dance.  Also, he puts a lot of resources on the web, if you use that sort of thing.
Steve was an awesome teacher and I greatly enjoyed his class.  Me and another person in the class sustained injuries during the quarter, and he was very flexible with us and gave us other ways to make up for not being able to participate in class.  Great guy, highly recommend.
Honestly a pretty cool guy and a pretty cool class. Class project was to eat at Taste of OSU. Dancing was lots of fun and he knows his stuff, but you learn so much that you can get lost. Not that it matters.
Steve Might be one of the greatest professors ever, He is a really fun guy to talk to and easy going.  His class Is really really fun and he's a very good dancer.  Take his Class, It might be the best thing you do at Ohio State.
Steve rocks the world.  I took social dance 2 with him and learned so much, and definitely looked forward to class.  Steve made it amazing!
i took both social dance 1 &amp; 2 from steve.  he is a great teacher, funny guy, and really breaks down the dance into its principle components so you learn it easily.  i loved going to class.  our level 2 class was especially close.  definitely recommend him!!
cool
Sweet
Steve Yao is good, but not as good as Professor A Sinha.
Steve is a great teacher and his class is amazing! I already took social dance one with a different instructor, but taking social dance 2 with Steve really made me a lot better-he's super helpful, and he makes the class fun!
Professor Yao is amazing!!!! Highly recommend this class!!:)

Great prof
Social Dance Class with Mr. Yao was great. He helped the class feel comfortable learning new dances and I really enjoyed the class. Thank you.
this class was a lot of fun and i really enjoyed it and steve was an awesome instructor and lots of help
A very nice and understanding teacher, who wants you to learn and have fun while doing so. He made the class very comfortable and would spend as much time as needed helping anyone. I highly reccomend this teacher, and plan on taking all the rest of the courses offered that he teaches. Definitely one of the best teachers that I have ever had!
Teacher name: Stoltzfus, Matthew
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
THIS IS A FLIPPED CLASS! This means you MUST be able to learn the material on your own by utilizing the textbook and provided reading guides, and then Dr. Fus uses lecture time to review, cover difficult concepts, and provide example problems. Be prepared to learn the information before lecture, and come to lecture with your questions.
He is the most amazing prof in chem I have ever meet. Although he assigned lots of daily grinds, most of them are not graded. Doing those helps a lot in improving grade. Recitations are easy and interesting.
One time I asked a question in class, and Dr. Stoltzfus responded with an answer heavily laden with contempt. I think there is a more professional way to communicate to me that this is a better question left for the TA lab.
Out of all the chemistry professors, he is the one that will teach you the material and make it feasible to pass with a decent grade. He holds several after class help sessions which include office hours and peer study. You'll want to go to those if you want to pass or else it'll be much harder. He explains exactly what you need to do to pass.
His teaching style doesnt really work unless you have extremely good discipline. If you take this class with him don't expect to learn any new information in lecture. Taking his class without having very much previous chemistry experience was excruciating. Be prepared to literally teach yourself the entire class. He was really nice &amp; accessible tho
Not gonna lie I was a little worried coming into to Chem 1210 because of its reputation of being a super hard class. However, Fus does a great job explaining concepts and he gives you all of the tools and resources that you need to succeed, so use them! Great teacher, great guy. Hoping i can transfer to his 1220 class this semester. Wish me luck!!
Dr. Fus is one of my favorite professors at tOSU! While his flipped learning style may not be for everyone, if you put the time and effort in before class, you are given the tools to succeed. Fus is also inspirational and likable as well! To succeed: read the book, watch the lecture videos, do the practice exams, and still go to class!
Dr. Fus is a great person who cares about his students, however in my opinion he is a terrible lecturer. He loves to give motivational speeches and many times you have no idea what he is talking about, content wise. He expects you to read, and provides many resources to excell in the course. He knows a lot about chem, but he does not explain well.
Dr. Fus makes you work for your grade, but that only because he has a reversed teaching style. In other words, you teach yourself and go to lecture to enhance the material you learned. Personally his teaching style gets students to remember concepts more once they learned them. He has amazing videos explaining concepts and he wrote the textbook.
Dr. Fus is a great professor. The tests were the same for every professor and his class always had the highest averages. He does a flipped classroom, so you're sort of forced to study outside of class. BUT you never have to go to lecture if you don't want to. I'd recommend it though, because he goes over tough examples.
Dr. Fus is without a doubt the best Chem 1210 professor. He is very engaging, lectures are amazing, clear grading criteria, lots of practice problems given, and the list goes on. He also cares a lot about his students, and he'll respond to a Carmen message really late at night (3am for me one time, not kidding). Do the work, and you'll succeed.
If you cannot stand flipped classroom beware. Fus is a nice guy but the teaching is not done in Lecture - examples are gone over in lecture and teaching is done through videos that usually cover all of the topic material... usually. If you like flipped classroom he is your guy. He also provides plenty of out of class practice to study on your own.
I understand he wants to do flip classroom but that isn't always possible with students that have a lot of coursework already. If you have time take class with Fus. He doesn't teach you, just tests you.
Great prof, readily available/good office hours. BUT he acts like his class is the only one you're taking. It's a flipped classroom so be ready to read the book before EVERY lecture. Tests are now committee-made (no longer an issue of his being harder.) Be ready to commit a lot of time/effort.
Dr. Fus made my experience with Chem 1220 much more manageable. He truly cares about his students success and made the textbook easier to understand in his lectures. You have to complete pre-lectures before each class which force you to read the book/ watch his flip lectures online and take notes. He has many helpful practice exams.
I chose to take Fus for my second chemistry course because of his high reviews on this site. DO NOT BE FOOLED! He does a flipped classroom so you teach yourself. His lectures are only examples. And he helped write the textbook so if you dont get something in the book chances are he wont help. Take Clark instead. (PS Fus's office hours are useless)
Dr. Fus really cares about his student's success. Gen Chem is not easy by any means, but he does his very best to set each student up for success. However, it is on the student to do all of the work. His expectations are clear, and if you follow them, although it is a lot of work, you should be able to do well in the class.
Dr. Fus is probably the best general chemistry professor that OSU offers. Listen to his advice at the beginning of the semester and work hard, and you will do well. He is pretty easy to meet with outside of class and offers so much practice material and review sessions. His high exam averages compared to other professors' classes don't lie.
Dr. Fus is such a great professor. He seriously cares about helping students succeed, even though everyone else in his department wants us to fail. He does use a flipped classroom, so if you are unable to handle that teaching style, avoid him. If you follow his advice he gives at the beginning of the semester, you can and will succeed in this class
Dr. Fus is probably the best teacher I have ever had. He is great at identifying and explaining the things that most students struggle with, and he genuinely cares about his students' success. His classes' averages on the standardized exams are consistently about 5-10% higher than other professors' averages.
Teacher name: Callam, Christopher
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Callam is one of the best prof I have ever had, hands down. He teaches the content really really well but for that reason his tests are super hard but if you actually pay attention in lecture and do what you should be doing, the tests are totally doable. You have to work for it, but Dallam helps every step along the way!
Probably the best professor I've had at OSU so far. Callam is a genius and a great teacher, he really helps you understand the material with his very thorough lectures and practice problems. Exams were really tough, but the quizzes were fine so it kind of balances out. Definitely do the problem sets and practice exams.
Dr. Callam is one of the best professors I have had at OSU! Super knowledgable and willing to help, especially if you go to office hours. Organic 2 lab is generally a little bit more difficult than the first, but definitely still manageable.
Dr. Callam has been one of my favorite science professors so far. He explains concepts in great details and covers important material more than once. The quizzes were pretty fair if you actually attended lecture. He's also really accessible if you are unable to attend his office hours. I highly recommend taking him for O-Chem!
BEST PROFESSOR EVER! I LOVE DR. CALLAM. He is a real gem. His exams were hard but he is really cool and makes you love O chem (no joke). Take with him. I don't know what else to say. Definition AWESOME. such a beautiful human being
BEST teacher I've ever had. He's hilarious, lectures are fun, and he explains everything so well, he's perfect. Book is pointless but don't skip class, do all the problem sets, old exams/quizzes, and go to office hours. It's a lot of work but he will go above and beyond to help you. Callam is a genius, no doubt he will change the world one day.
A great professor. The best option for any o-chem class. He posts his notes on carmen and gives students plenty of resources to learn/study from.
Dr. Callam is great. The lectures are clear and informative, and interesting for the most part (as much as chemistry can be interesting). OChem Lab is a tough course, and honestly your TA can make or break your grade, but Callam himself is very helpful. The exam is tough, but he offers a lot of material to help you prepare.
Callam is a real gem. He's funny, draws perfect hexagons, and has never made a mistake on paper. Callam is very good at explaining things because he anticipates what students are thinking.
He is without a doubt the best professor I have ever had. He did an amazing job of explaining the material in an interesting way. Definitely recommend going to lecture because he lets you know everything that it important to know for the tests. Do the problem sets and old exams that he posts online because those are most like his exam questions.
Callams the best prof at OSU and he prepares you extremely well for exams and makes a hard subject super interesting. The material itself isnt hard and with practice, a good grade is definitely achievable.
Dr. Callam is really great. He cares about students. His lectures are clear and he gives great resources for studying. However, o chem is very hard and his exams are 2 hrs long &amp; very difficult. He combines several concepts into 1 problem. I'm going to retake the class because I'm not happy with my grade. Requires lots of practice outside of class
I love Dr. Callam! His class is not easy by any means but he gives you tons of practice problems and old exams to study from. He is very helpful in office hours so go and ask questions. His exams are very challenging but if you prepare enough ahead of time, you will be fine. Curve was nice.
Very smart guy and a great professor. The course itself has an annoying amount of work for a 2 credit class, and it's very easy to miss a deadline for an assignment. But it's ochem, so what else would you expect. Regardless, him and Dr. Paul are great characters and are awesome to talk to. They make the notorious ochem much more bearable.
Was definitely a very difficult class but I would never take it with anyone else. A truly amazing teacher who cared about his students, and definitely my favorite professor I've had at OSU. Hilarious, well organized, overall great. It's a challenge, but I loved it and he made the course manageable.
He is the best. Can't wait for 2550 with him. He is a great lecturer and really breaks things down so they are easier to understand. The midterm is kinda tough but the final is a huge opportunity for bonus points. Definitely not a tough class if you pay attention and study.
Dr. Callam basically played bad cop and taught the spectroscopy part of the class which is a hard topic to teach. He did his best and used as many examples as possible. But he's not a very accessible lecturer.
Dr. Callam is a great O Chem teacher. I definitely recommend him. Love him loads.
I struggled in gen chem, but Dr. Callam made ochem fun for me. He is really good at explaining what is going on and provides so many materials for you to practice. While its not an easy class and I study basically every day, Ive definitely learned from him. His midterms aren't impossible if you put in the work. I recommend
Callam is a great professor and very smart. His humor is one of his best attributes. If you go to lecture, take good notes and study, there is no reason you cannot do well in this class. The O-chem textbook is also extremely helpful. His tests are very hard if you skip class, but can be easy if you study your notes and do all the problem sets.
Teacher name: Osman, Alan
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I really liked Osman before taking this course. The material was boring and had very little to do with economics. He just went over outlines from the book telling you to look things up on your own. No attendance but random quizzes that you can't make up even if you have an excuse. 2 papers that have the strangest and most confusing format EVER!
I had Dr. Osman in his last semester of teaching at OSU. He was old, confusing, and cocky. I loved him as a person, but as a teacher he was god awful. Just read the textbook and show up for class. You'll do fine.
His teaching style is incredibly annoying. He hardly goes over the material you actually have to know and instead just tells anecdotal stories. He can be condescending and acts like every thing he talks about is common knowledge. His instructions for assignments are extremely vague and he even had to push back one assignment twice due to confusion.
Be prepared to teach yourself.  He reads slides made by the txtbk company &amp; gets mad when you take in class notes.  Tests are basically identical to study guide questions if you purchase it.. but only helpful if you've already read the entire textbook on your own &amp; taught yourself material.  Takes suggestions on how to run class but never uses them
Learn the material, don't memorize it. Osman knows a lot about economics and he tries to encourage students to do their best. A lot of people complain about his negative attitude towards note-taking in lectures,but the slides get posted on Carmen and you really do learn more if you are actively listening. The lectures can get dull; it is econ.
Lectures were a waste, he sped through slides and was angry if you actually took notes. Very rude but gave a ton of bonus questions for exams.
One of the most boring and easiest class in this university. Although he is knowledgeable, he is condescending and boring.
This class is very boring. He just repeats material in the textbook. Also, he requires participation and randomly evaluate it. The class size is also large. Do not take it.
Never went to lectures because he would literally read straight out of the textbook and yell at us for taking notes. All you have to do is read the textbook thoroughly and try to attend recitations. Tests weren't too bad considering he included a lot of extra credit but you have to know the information really well.
I never went to his lectures because he just flashes long, wordy slides the whole time. I only went to recitation and my TA was much more clear. Osman's tests are pretty hard. You have to really understand the material- he asks application questions; not just definition-based. Builds in plenty of extra credit though. Read the WHOLE book &amp; get an A.
Terrible professor. Easy class. Lectures are mandatory but useless. He goes off topic all the time. Talks at a low whisper. Has terrible handwriting but writes randm stuff on the board and says it'll be on the midterm but it's not. You're graded on participation but he wants genius answers above and beyond what's in the book. Never taking him again
I'm taking macro economics with this professor and he is one of the most knowledgeable lectures I've ever had. The material is macroeconomics don't expect it to be some kind of action movie. And to the people who say he is insulting, you either shouldn't be in college or just don't have a sense of humor. Good professor overall!
Lectures are very dry, very hard to follow along. He tries to tie real world examples in but he can never get them out how he wants. He's also very rude and insulting. He makes you feel stupid and wrong if you are not an econ major.
He is very confusing and unhelpful.
This class is really hard to listen and pay attention because its very dry, but he tries to make it interesting. Offers a lot of extra points, so easy enough to get a decent grade.
Great professor. Very knowledgeable. Relates class concepts to real world events. Easy enough to get a good grade if you read the book and pay attention to most lectures.
Oppressively boring in class. Has hearing problems (be ready to speak up and repeat yourself) not particularly helpful or insightful on subject matter (dude loves the textbook and doesn't deviate from its content.) Mandatory participation is clunky. The grading's super easy, however. So if you want that, take it, just don't expect to enjoy it.
This guy is the man. He is literally one of the most interesting people I have ever met. Plus he's a great teacher. Very straightforward. You can get up to 2% bonus for going to every class, 2% more for doing a presentation, and on every exam you can miss 5 out of 30 questions and still get a 100% on exam. Take this class.
He is very knowledgeable, I took his Econ Development class and I really enjoyed his personal stories about helping countries. However, class is dry, tests are all based on the textbook so going to class wasn't necessary, around only 9 people show up consistently. I ended up getting an A just by reading the book. A lot of people failed the final.
Really knowledgable. Tests aren't that hard provided you read the textbook. His recommendation is that you don't take notes from his class, but from the book so you can actually listen to his lectures instead of frantically copying the powerpoints. I agree with this recommendation 100%. Read the book, take notes, pay attention, and study. Not hard.

Teacher comments: 
Lectures are abhorrently boring. The material itself is a breeze, but knowing this - Terry chooses to ask questions of zero importance to the topic. His tests consist of very specific questions about examples he uses and useless information. Don't think that you'll do well just because you understand the material, you have to play his game.
Yikes. Terry is a nice guy and is funny, but man is his class difficult, as a dean's list student every semester at OSU. Nothing is clear about the online assignments, and the exams are super hard. Only three of them too so you better do well! Watch his online lectures the week of the exam, and that's all I got. Good luck....
I'm an A student. Much of my time was wasted deciphering Terry Paul's vague syllabus. The class is confusing for absolutely no reason. Instead of just writing the specific due dates of assignments in the syllabus, he gives complicated criteria you are supposed to use to determine if you have an assignment or not that week. Clarity is lacking.
Nice guy, means well. Thats the only good thing I can say. He has no experience in the business world, with regards to marketing and sales, so he has a very difficult time applying concept to real world applications. Hes a textbook professor, not a businessman.
The confusion of the online assignments was a little annoying but other than that, its not as bad as people say. I would actually recommend watching all of the lecture videos online the week of an exam instead of attending in person so the small annoying details are fresher in your mind. I never went to class &amp; got an A with the heavy curve
Terry's a nice and funny guy, but this class is absolutely ridiculous. It is super disorganized and the grading system is very unclear. His tests are really hard because there is so much information and his questions can be very specific.
Terry is a horrible professor who believes he is actually teaching marketing to his students. He has the stupidest jokes that end up on his exams. His exams are very tough for an undergrad. For example he will ask a question from the interviews which are so irrelevant such as what was somebody's major. Overall, I am convinced I will not pursue MKTG
he may give extra credit but this is just because he knows he is a TERRIBLE TERRY. literally didnt learn a single thing from his class because I was to fixated at trying to understand where his points were coming from. His exams are extremely hard and he curves the class but also because his exams are very VERY hard. I repeat, very hard.
Terry is a very nice guy and is really engaged in this subject. However, it is just a lot of information. The tests are difficult because of the fact that there is so much information. Make sure to watch the interviews because those are easy points. Don't save all your studying until the last couple days, you will be overwhelmed. Do the EC early!
He posts the lectures on Carmen, so you can either go to class or watch the lectures online. The online lectures and in-person lectures are 90% the same (even the stories or examples he tells). The class is curved but exams alone are 60% of your grade, so be sure to study! The book isn't super dense and there's extra credit available through SONA.
Terry was a good professor. Lecture was LONG and he goes over so much stuff, but go to lecture. I did not read the book at all. I wrote a ton on my lecture slides and studied that info, watched the interviews, and studied the warmups for the exams. Got an A in the class with his curve and had low Bs on the exams. Nice professor, just go to class!
For a principles class, he takes it too far. I never knew what would be important in class as he rambles on and on about stuff, which is why his lectures are so long. He cracks jokes and expects you to know what examples he used in class for the test, which could have been one of these jokes. I didn't learn marketing at all from his class.
His class isn't nearly as hard as everyone makes it out to be, you just have to show up to class and take notes. People find it hard because his class is so painfully boring it's hard to pay attention. Avoid the trap of watching the lecture videos instead of going to class... they are much harder to pay attention to and get anything out of
Exams are difficult. I did not read the book for the first exam and did fine - 80% or an A- on his scale. Some specific, stupid questions, but not as bad as others are saying. Review lecture notes (take good ones) and the online warm-ups and quizzes for textbook material. His curve in the class is supposed to help.
Class is really boring, drags on and on. Good professor though, kind of funny. Exams can be tough, but not impossible. Option to watch online videos instead of lecture. Unusual grading scale on curve. 2 Non-Comprehensive Midterms, 75 MC Q each. Online Quizzes and Warm-Ups through Pearson.
Terry is a great &amp; funny guy, but his exams are way too hard and specific for an intro level course. This is a class that you need to read the suggested chapters in--he will pull a lot of that into his exams. Pay attention during lectures &amp; take good notes because he will pull from that. He rambles &amp; I never knew what I needed to know from lecture.
Paul is kind of a goof. His lectures are at least entertaining but way too long. The exams don't actually test you on how well you know marketing, they are more on how well you paid attention to little things he says in class. Exams are curved though so its not too hard to get a decent grade
You can either watch the lectures online or attend in person. Both were very similar. Tends to talk about a LOT during lecture so you don't know what's important for the exams. He also asks very specific questions on the exams. You ave to read one/two chapters each week and take a weekly quiz (which were easy), but the book explains concepts well
He is a good teacher and the lectures are really informative. The tests are unreasonably hard even if you read all the chapters and know the lectures by heart. The curve in the class is generous though. Seems like he is trying to prove a point that Marketing is harder than people think. He succeeds. Make sure you do the extra credit, you'll need it
The topic is interesting, but his tests are ridiculously specific. Make sure to study the notes on his lectures especially, those are most important. The interviews are extremely tedious and the questions he asks over them have nothing to do with marketing. I'd recommend a different lecturer if possible, this was practically an online class anyway.

Teacher comments: 
My most difficult class this semester. Professor was difficult and outside optional work is key to succeed in the class. Being self motivated is what allowed me to receive an A in this class. Ask questions and she'll answer them, but Bonnie is very blunt and will not slow down unless you stop her. Not a great professor, but class is do-able.
The absolute worst class I have had to take ever. Everyone suggested trying to avoid Bonnie as a teacher but unfortunately I got put with her. Lectures are confusing, Bonnie is condescending to questions &amp; she never finishes her slides. Recitations are led by Bonnie so you get no other views. Group cases are too difficult. Homework isn't related.
I was afraid of going into this class because of all the reviews. Bonnie is a great professor. To pass the class: go to lecture for extra credit (there is material not discussed in the videos), watch the videos before lecture, and just actually try. It is a tough class but the material is so repetitive that it makes it easy. Just apply yourself
She always doesn't have proper arrangement for the lec, and cannot finish the full content of the slides. Also, she never post full slides that she missed and still test the content. Sometimes, the lec makes the easier class material more confused. Take this course with another professor if possible.
There are 2 professors teaching BUS2320 &amp; you have to take it in Fisher- biggest advice? Do whatever you can to NOT get Bonnie. Her lectures actually make the content more confusing and she comes across very condescending. Material is pretty tough, but Bonnie makes it worse and recitation is borderline useless as the TA's just follow her lead.
This is probably the worst class I've taken at Ohio State. Bonnie is nice and probably means well but is an awful lecturer, so bad that I feel like lecture has made the material tougher to understand. The class is very poorly organized and you will have to spend a significant amount of time teaching yourself the material if you want to do well.
Absolutely useless as a teacher, unsure how she still has a job teaching. Her teaching material has no logical flow, everything is online, she doesnt actually show you how to solve practice problems, the problems on tests are things that have never been discussed in class, doesnt let recitation leaders teach so you wont get another perspective.
This was by far the most difficult class I have ever taken. Currently I have an A by a fluke, however most of my peers have D's and F's. All of the material is extremely confusing. Lectures are not helpful and boring. Consumes more time than my other 4 classes combined. Avoid at all costs. Her emails seem condescending. Take course at C state!!!!
I got an A in this class but it was by far the hardest class I have taken thus far. The material isn't necessarily hard itself, it's the way she teaches the class. Instead of teaching us how to use formulas she used an online tool all semester, which we cant use on exam. Make a study group with some other ppl in class so you can help each other out
2320 might be the worst class that we're forced to take at Fisher and Mrs. Schroeder does not make it any easier. The material is confusing and repetitive and she doesn't really know how to organize it in an easy-to-understand manner. Just go to class for extra credit and then be like me and vent your frustrations through this website.
Bonnie's lectures and videos are confusing. The class concepts are not that hard, just go through the lecture notes and make sense of it on your own. Read your textbook or online or go to the TAs for help. Definitely study the practice exams she posts! AIM TO GET ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT OFFERED! There is close to 70 points offered of extra credit!
The class is super unorganized since you have lecture notes, lecture videos, and recitations that are all teaching different things. She doesn't do the best job explaining but it is a mandatory business class so suffer through it. Just got to lecture for extra credit and somehow teach yourself the material and you'll do okay
I am in her class right now and I can tell you I do not understand a single thing in this class. All of this material should be so easy but she makes it so difficult to understand. And all the case studies she assigns are so vague that you don't understand what to do.
Truly an awful lecturer. She makes material that should be fairly staright foward very hard to understand. If you ask questions, she will be condescending. I would suggest trying to get into Draper's class or at least going to his lectures. Otherwise just try to teach yourself because she is useless.
Waiting for one more grade to be put in, but will most likely get a A only because I was able to teach myself the material before exams. Very poor lecturer. Does not fully or properly explain anything, and is very hard to listen to. Try to get any other lecturer.
Bonnie is a nice lady but her lectures are terrible. If you have her I highly suggest going to another professor's lectures instead of hers, I didn't learn anything from her lectures.
Her lecturing only makes the material more confusing than it really is.
She cannot teach period the end.  Lectures are very confusing and she never explains anything just assumes we all get it.  She has an attitude whenever someone asks a question.  Even her emails she send sound condescending towards all the students.  If you can find another professor to take this class with do it or take it at CSCC.
She is terrible at explaining things, usually she makes topics more confusing. She is awful at organizing lectures and covering topics. She's nice but is just awful at teaching. Be prepared to learn the material on your own.
If you do the work and show that you're putting in effort, you're not going to have any problems with Bonnie. Tests and 3 cases are all very straightforward with a few rogue questions. She can be intense but if you go to office hours and study it should be a relatively easy A. Gives tons of extra credit on exams and homework so make sure to do it.

Teacher comments: 
Currently taking H. Physiology with Dr. B &amp; although the class is hard &amp; exams are tricky i think shes a great professor. I would recommend that you record lectures and write down all the examples she gives (that are not on the slides). The party room is a MUST! Its very helpful &amp; also checking piazza is important. She also does x cred on exams
Class is a lot of work but she is a great professor. Everyone complains that its a hard class as there is a lot of information for a 3 credit hour class. Lot of useful information for the MCAT. Very helpful office hours and I found those to be somewhat mandatory.
The class was heavily focused on memorization, the slides presented don't contain all the information you need for testing so you also need to follow what she is saying make sure to record lectures. Don't take the class if you have a heavy semester.
Class is structured in building manner. Requires time and effort to get comfortable with material/her teaching style, but not unusually hard. Help is very accessible through Piazza question forum and study room w/ TAs. Gives lots of extra credit opportunities. Best biological science class I've taken thus far.
There is definitely a learning curve involved, but once you get used to her testing style, her exams aren't as hard. Class requires consistent review of material but help is very accessible via everyday Party Room (study room with Phys Phabs/TAs) and Piazza question forum. Best class I've taken thus far. Learned the material extremely well.
I took this vs other options bc I thought it would be helpful for med school. The convoluted manner this class was taught has NOT prepared me better than any of my current classmates. Also, I asked a TA for advice bc I was scoring the same on quizzes no matter how long I studied, and his advice was to get more bonus q's right.
Do your self a favor and take this class at Columbus State. Dr. B makes her weekly quizzes impossible and will try her best to trick you. She hides extra credit in the directions and has tricky ec questions that you only get if you go to class. If you are a pre-PA student you need H. Physiology with a lab. Take it at Columbus State!!!
I have never had a professor that I didn't like.. until I met Cynthia Bronson. She really tries to trick her students in a class that she is already over complicating. The party room is useless, and the TAs know just about as much as the current students do. I would avoid this class at all costs unless you're ready to hate your life for a semester.
Go to party room, review sessions, kahoots, and use the UGTA phys phabs as much as possible. Don't be too hard on yourself about a low exam grade for the weekly exams, four of them are dropped. Get any and every bonus point you can. Material really sticks because of the odd way it is taught. Talking through material is important in understanding
After my first year coming to an end, I can say that Dr. Bronson has been my favorite professor at OSU. She cares about her students because she offers resources for you to do well in the class. Her lectures are also interesting! Weekly exams are tough (EC on them) . What I recommend doing for this class is record lecture, and use all resources.
I am a past TA for Bronson and took her class as a freshman at OSU. You have to go to lecture to pass, no questions asked. I would record her lectures and write down anything that is not on the slides, because the slides can be accessed after class in the party room if you need them. Her tests are very tricky; make sure you know your stuff.
This is definitely the hardest class I have had. Only take this class if you HAVE to. I missed out on being able to enjoy an entire semester at OSU because I had to worry about the weekly exams. She never takes the blame when students fail her exams every week and has tried to diagnose people with anxiety, which is inappropriate. Only plus is bonus
Easily the hardest class I've ever taken. Not because of the amount or the difficulty of the work, but because she does not make things clear. Her questions are very strange, you can still end up with an F in this class even if you have a good understanding of the body. This woman is very quirky in a bad way. Take this class at Columbus State
Horrible, Weekly quizzes are impossible, two exams are impossible too. Read very carefully because she loves to trick you. If you can, take this class at Columbus State 100x better than taking it with her. There is a quiz on the same day as the midterm. why? idk.... its a horrible class.
Bronson is tough teacher with tough tests and grading system. She has 13 weekly exams with midterm and final. U can drop 3 of the weekly exams but cannot drop the exams that occurs with the midterm and final. U only have 15 minutes to do 20 questions on weekly exam. On midterm u have to do an exam and midterm in the same day. Each question is story
I spent majority of my time on this class. I studied constantly but still couldn't seem to achieve the grades I wanted on all of the weekly exams due to the nature of her exams. She does offer a lot of extra credit on each exam though. Record lectures- she will test you on many things not in her vague notes.
She expects you to put in a LOT of work outside of class to do well. Go to kahoot, party room, and the review every week to get all the extra credit points. Only read the phys cafe on the discussion board, that's where most extra credit ?'s come from and the other boards are unhelpful and take up too much time. Put in the work and you'll succeed.
Weekly tests are hard to interpret especially since they're only 20 minutes long. The class itself sucks, but what you learn and the level you have to study to get a decent grade is beneficial. Definitely good for pre med/dental students.
Good teacher and passionate about what she does, but makes the tests way harder than they should be. If you study the material, and really take your time to read everything on the exams, then you'll do fine. I did just fine in the maymester but it was 4 weeks of hell. Just keep with it!
If you are premed or dentistry, this class will definitely help you prepare for grad school. If you are pre-nursing or other, I think you better take a different class. It's an intro level weed-out course designed to deconstruct and rebuild how you learn and retain info, then apply to tricky situations. With a little physiology added in.
Teacher name: Mallon, Michelle
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Mallon is so nice. The class is not easy, but she makes it so much easier to understand. You'll still need to put in the extra effort outside of class, but if you go to lecture, she is SO helpful! Take good notes and do the practice problems before class like she suggests and you'll do great!
She is a great person and really cares about your learning. However, if possible, look for any other professor. Attendance is mandatory, if you skip, prepare to lose copious amounts of points. She plays by the book. Our final presentation requires 3 questions from the audience or we get docked points. She's the only prof that enforces this.
I love this teacher. I want her to be my mom. She cares about you. Keeps class fun.
This is a rating of the instructor and not the content of the class. Mallon is great. She's exactly what I think a teacher should be. She's stern but understanding. She takes a lot of time to make sure you'll be able to follow content that she didn't create.
Well, to be honest, before I take CSE 1113 class, I am really scared cuz she has a bad reputation on Rate my professor website. But after I take her class, I find she is a really nice teacher. You can't blame her the class is hard, it is not her fault. If you are diligent and do have problems, go to her office and she will be really happy to help.
She is so helpful with questions and is completely clear on the information needed to know for exams. I hardly put any time into this class except like 2 hours every 2 weeks and got an A-. AKA you can easily get an A if you put in the effort. You do have to read a lot from the textbook and learn about computers which is kinda boring.
She takes herself and this class way too seriously, especially with the attendance component. She pulls test questions out of nowhere that can't even be answered by the book. Extra credit is your saving grace. I work harder in this 2 credit class than my other ones. Avoid if you can.
I took the distance version of CSE 1110, and Professor Mallon made it very easy to succeed. Very clear and very helpful.
Michelle Mallon might seem a little strict at times but she really is a nice person and a good teacher. She keeps lectures interesting and really cares about her students understanding the material presented. The class itself is easy; one research paper and one oral presentation. If you skip class, you lose 5% of your overall grade, so don't skip.
Never seen such bad teacher before! The person, herself is unreasonable, as well as all of her classes.
Michelle cares for her students and wants them to do well. She is always accessible and even welcoming for office hours. There is very little extra credit and no curve but with practice exams that are very similar to the actual exams. It just takes a solid understanding too do well, there won't be an curve balls.
CSE 1113 is only one session long, so you only meet once a week for 7 weeks. There is only one assignment a week, but it contains many parts so I would recommend starting them early. Having background knowledge in Excel is really pretty important. Michelle really cares about our success and explains things very clearly. She's very approachable!
Michelle honestly wants everyone to succeed. Office hours help, and practice exams prepare you for the in lab exam and final. Put the effort in and go to office hours as needed, youll get an A. Take time to learn the material before class because it will make Michelle's lessons so much clearer and more helpful. She is a good teacher overall.
The worst teacher I have ever met in OSU. Mandatory attention and tough grade on paper. Nearly sent me to school office for I didn't properly cite on my paper even it is very good citation in other writing class. Also, No Electronic Device in class and she is super boring.
Her paper requirement is unclear. A 2,000 words long research paper and a presentation. Thats all. I rewriting the paper couple times but she still not think it good. Her class is boring and make me want to fall asleep. Attendance is mandatory and not allow to use any electronic devices.
Yes attendance is mandatory, yes she grades tough on the paper but that's two thirds of your grade right there.  The other 13 is a presentation on your paper.  You get two chances to get a good grade on the paper.  Put in just a little effort and you get a good grade.  Those complaining are those who want an easy A, this is college, get used to it
The worst teacher I've ever met. Pretend to be nice but useless. Choose another section if you want to pass.
She is super passionate about ethics. Like, so passionate it makes me want to cry. She grades really hard. Assignments: one paper and one, 10 minute presentation. You must attend all lectures or you will lose a letter grade for every missed lecture. For a 1 credit hour class, it was the biggest pain in my ...
Along with every other review since the switch to semesters, I found her class expectations very confusing resulting in a poor teaching quality. She creates an atmosphere reminiscent of high school, and the course material cannot be considered higher education. If you have to take the class, take it, but do not expect to enjoy it. Score should be 0
Terrible.  I gained nothing from her ethics class, it was mostly a complete waste of time.  She takes a one credit hour far too seriously, yet still doesn't manage to teach anything.

Unfortunately, this professor is not available for sharing his experience with the next generation of engineers and researchers.
Great Prof for Engineering. Retired Spring Quarter 2009
Great teacher, had alot of fun and actually learned alot. Things can get confusing at times but show up to class everyday, and you'll end up learning something.
Good teacher.  Great guy.  Easy class
Dr. Gozon is the most interesting person I have ever met. He has done a lot with his life, and will tell you all about it. Very nice guy, and means well, if you can get past his dry humor. Class is a breeze if you pay close attention to his detail and show up!
g0z0n r0x
Dr. Gozon was the most helpful professor that I've had at OSU. The class can be difficult if you don't keep on top of it but he will do anything to help you understand. Oh yeah, throw some pics of puppies on cover sheets of reports for a few bonus points!
Great Professor, class material was tough if you dont work at it. Do the work in class and ask for help and the class is a piece of cake.
Well organized class.  The structure of the material progressively got harder as well at its usefulness.  I was glad to have Dr. Gozon teaching me and I would take the class again for a GPA booster if I could .. lol
The title of this class is problem solving. This includes exams in which you are given a unlabeled data input file and no instructions. As it turns out, even the most sophisticated problem solvers have trouble with this. I got an A, but dealing with that all quarter was frustrating and a waste of my time.
Dr. Gozon is not your typical Professor, this man will teach you about not just engineering but how to be a better person. The class is not very structured but you get what you want to get from it. I would definatley recommend it to everyone.
Strange class...Civil Eng students had a COMPLETELY different curriculum.  I could never tell if he was speaking to us or the non-civils. Learned nothing from the class but got good advice from Gozon.
The best professor ever!!!
Very helpful, easy to work with
This professor is super easy and funny, but you don't really learn anything at all.
Dr. Gozon is great.  Very entertaining and if you show up and do some work you will do well.
Class isn't as easy as people make it out to be, however, Dr. Gozon is an extremely fair teacher.
Dr. Gozon is enjoyable to be around and he understands the students.
Dr. Gozon is very willing to help! His class is good and as long as you show up you will get an A.
This class had no structure what at all. Professor tried nothing to help you learn the material that you were expected to know 1. what the material actually was and 2. what exactly to do for the day's work. If you would like to shoot yourself everyday, take this class. Oh, and it didn't matter what you did, you can get an A because of self grading.
Teacher name: Cogan, John
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
One of the first few weeks of class he quoted Trump, and I was immediately turned off. Hard to want to learn from him after that. Regardless he was always available when I needed and even though I struggled with the midterms because there was often a lot of material, he was willing to help when he could.
Dr. Cogan rally cares for his students and did a lot in terms of offering extra credit and points. He took his own time every Sunday evening to come in and assist students with questions and homework. Overall a good guy, just not a great professor when it came to actually teaching the material. Very hard exams so make sure to study well.
Dr Cogan truly cares about his students. He acknowledges that this class is difficult, and there is too much material for the time frame. His exams are difficult, but if you stay around average you can ride the curve. He gives generous points for in class participation and online homework, so do those if you think you'll struggle.
Dr. Cogan is a great professor who really cares about his students. He takes time out of his schedule to be accessible outside of class, and holds weekly review sessions. He also does in class questions/activities to help make the class more engaging. His exams can be difficult, but if you take time to study then you can do well in the class.
His lectures are boring, but you need to pay attention because the commentary he adds to the slides is often the material on the exams. The exams are specific and difficult, however they aren't too bad if you take the time to study for them and not cram too much.
Although some days lectures don't seem to have anything to do with the course material, Dr. Cogan is always fun to listen to and learn from. His exams are extremely fair and you go in knowing exactly what will be on them. If there ever is a weird question on an exam feel free to argue why your answer was right and you'll probably get your points.
Dr. Cogan is so nice and open to helping students; however, I probably wouldnt advise taking his class unless you have a solid understanding of Biochem. Exams are extremely difficult, even if you study weeks ahead of time it wont help much. I wouldnt advise this class if needed it for med school. We were behind and didn't cover as much material
Dr. Cogan is an exceptional professor who clearly cares about student success. He had office hours regularly and even held Sunday study sessions regularly for students. Dr. Cogan's tests were not exceedingly difficult if you pay attention in lecture (they're interesting), but his exams are largely lecture-based so you will not do well if you skip.
People say he's caring but all I ever got from asking questions was condescension. He is available often but that wasn't much help to me. Pretty easy tests but part of the battle was understanding his notes and how he writes his questions. Just know the exam check lists he posts.
Dr. Cogan was a pretty great professor. His exams were tough and his lecture notes were sometimes really difficult to understand, but if you actually study and participate, you will do fine in his class.
Cogan is a fair and caring professor. The class is difficult but it's biochem. He gives a lot of opportunities to earn extra points and a lot of help outside of lectures. This class is hard but structured to help you be very successful if you put in the time and effort. He also does a great job of marking his notes with MCAT tested material.
He made Biochem4511 the most frustrating class. His lectures were filled with a bunch of nonsensical tangents and random facts that he found interesting. He assigned homework that did not translate from his lectures. Also, we got so far behind we had to learn two different chapters at once for the last several weeks. His tests are all application.
Dr. Cogan is very unorganized and goes so slow to the point the other biochem classes are a month or so ahead. Instead of cutting out material, in the last couple weeks he posted about 10 lecture videos to compensate for getting behind and gave a midterm less than a week before the final over 6 chapters, most of which he barely covered in lecture.
Overall, this class was extremely difficult. I do think he is fair though. He cares a lot about his students and opens his classroom every Sunday for 2 hours to help with the homework. If you go to these sessions you are guaranteed a 100% on these assignments, due to the help he gives and the group effort. His notes are confusing and exams are hard
Dr. Cogan is not a professor I would recommend to anyone. I have put fourth immense amount of effort to this class and have gotten nothing out of it. The lectures are not helpful by any means. He assigns copious amounts of homework that does not help to understand the material. If you can get any other professor for this course do it at all costs!!
Dr. Cogan is a fantastic professor! I wouldn't normally post a review on here but I was shocked at how many people found him to be difficult or confusing. His tests are fair, given that harder questions are straightforward because they are straight from concepts that he emphasized in class. Much easier than other biochem profs as far as I've heard.
Dr. Cogan is a great professor who really cares about his students. The course is challenging, but if you read the book and study you'll be fine. He's always looking for ways to improve his teaching methods, and he even does research on finding the best way to help kids learn. A really nice guy
I loved having Dr. Cogan. He made concepts a lot easier and was a big help in office hours. He is incredibly caring and genuinely a great guy.
I had him for Evidence and he was awesome! Okay, his lectures were not useful and I did not pay attention much. However, his midterm is so by the book if you are willing to take the time to read, decipher and learn the material you will do well. One of my higher grades in law school.
Lectures were worthless, only went for the participation points. Gave an extra ACS final exam at the very end, he was the only one in the department that gave this- very annoying. The tests weren't that bad, but questions were littered with gram. errors- hard to understand. Backwards classroom- its hard to do that successfully in a 200+ lecture.
Teacher name: Mirzaie, Ida
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
A prominent accent, deficient mic, illegible notes scribbled filling PowerPoint slides, overhasty speech all have resulted in the omission of crucial information and obstructed solid understanding of the content from lectures. The grading system will screw you. Someone may be an expert in a subject but that does not mean they are qualified to teach
Ida is a really sweet lady but her powerpoint don't go into depth on anything. Reading the book helped me the most personally and doing the online homework for extra credit also helps. Quizzes are really hard and the midterms and final are also difficult but use the book to help you out.
Ida is not a terrible lecturer but she could be better. A little boring at times but overall I enjoyed her class. As long as you pay attention and take good notes its an easy A.
The class material is very easy, but the lecture is exceptionally boring and unhelpful; so I did not go to any lectures for 3 months in the semester but still managed to get an A. The tests are extremely easy as long as you read the simple textbook before the tests.
Ida doesn't have the best lectures but the class isn't hard to make up for it. There are 4 tests (3 midterms and one final, but one of the four gets dropped), 9 online homework quizzes (3 get dropped and they are 5 multiple choice each). She offers extra credit for attendance and participation so it should be an easy A if you put in any effort.
Ida's lectures are unbearable. It is tough to understand her under her thick accent and she is not even slightly engaging during lectures. However, by using her powerpoint slides and the book, it is easy to obtain an A in the class. She drops the lowest four quizzes as well as your lowest exam grade (including the final), making the final optional.
I got a 5 on the AP Macro Exam, so Micro was a breeze to me, and I ended with an A without even taking the final exam. She does not explain concepts well, and it's extremely hard to understand her. She will skip around while presenting, so it's hard to follow. Go lectures for extra credit. Read textbook and watch videos, and it won't be that bad.
Ida is very knowledgeable about economics but it can be hard to follow along or stay engaged with her accent. I went to maybe 3 lectures and almost all of my recitations and passed with an A. Its really just about studying the things you dont understand and learning vocabulary. Recitations are a great way to simplify lecture material
Professor Mirzaie was great! With lectures, handouts, online homework, and textbook readings, any student who wishes to do well can do well. There are good extra credit opportunities and the lowest exam grade was dropped. Anyone who complains about not understanding her or her accent is being unreasonable. She is very coherent and understandable.
Even though lectures are online, go to class. Plus youll get bonus points. And recitations are extra credit too and you learn a lot from them. Shes hard to understand but going to lectures are definitely worth it.
Very dry lectures. Often contradicts her slides when she's speaking. Also very thick accent. Very detailed content but does pull some exam questions from the practice quizzes.
I enjoyed this professor, however she might not be for everyone. The grade in the class is determined by a few things, but she also offers extra credit opportunities. If you express your desire to learn in her class, she will be willing to help you.
I personally loved this class and this professor. Gave you plenty of opportunities to succeed and presented material in different ways until entire class understood. If I had time in my schedule I'd take her class again next semester.
The most dry lectures you will find and 90% of your grade is 3 exams that are all only 30 questions. Good luck not falling asleep.
Easy class. Light homework and quizzes. Extra credit. She has accent, but she is very caring and thoughtful.
This was honestly the worst class i've taken by far. For an entry level microeconomics class, it was VERY hard. After studying for hours every week, I still received grades much lower than I think I deserved. The class average on exams was 19 out of 20, and she didn't seem to care. Overall I would NOT recommend anyone take her courses!
For an entry level micro class- a ridiculous amount of work is required. With hours of studying I still received grades much lower than what I expected. Very unapologetic about the average being a 19/30, and a curve was promised after every midterm. There was no curve at the end, except from a 79 to an 80. A tough class and extremely dry lectures.
Extra credit isn't extra credit. It's not graded out of 0 so if you don't do it, it hurts your grade. But for some reason is labeled as extra credit.
Hard to understand during very boring, dry lectures. Read the book and do practice exams and you'll get an A easy.
She just stands up and lectures and isnt very engaging. Yes she puts her lectures online but the exams are always a lot harder than they should be. Having a good TA will help with this class alot
Teacher name: Aboughazi, Rachida
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Sweetest woman in the world! Her lectures were okay, attendance is not mandatory but it helps to listen. Recitation definitely taught more than lecture. She puts up plenty resources to do well on tests, the exams have the exact types of problems in the practice exams and quizzes. If you still feel shaky, do the homework.
Super nice, but quickly blows through lectures, and posts the notes online after class. After the first 4 weeks, I stopped showing up every single day because I actually learned more from my TA during recitation than I did in lecture.
As far as math goes, this prof is actually pretty great. I have trouble paying attention in math and enjoying professors, but she does a really good job teaching what she does, despite the dry subject matter.
What a woman. She is hilarious and a great lecturer. I'm not the best at math and she made 1150 a lot easier for me
I had to drop this class initially and she was WAY better than my previous guy. She organizes her notes in a way that clearly outlines different examples and she knows what she's doing. Really listen to her tips and tricks!!! This is a difficult class so make sure you are doing the PRACTICE WORKSHEETS and PRACTICE EXAMS!!!
Great lecture style- gave info in easy-to-understand pieces and did example problems solved during lecture. Receptive to questions during lecture. Class is hard (taylor series) but she/math dept. made sure to give us a list of things to know for test. Prof. also gave a self-made guide before exams in addition to study guide given by the department.
Nice lady, but blows through lecture material like you already know it, and then immediately posts the notes online. Total waste of time going to lecture when Khan Academy videos teach the material, and you have a recitation.
Didn't go to lecture--she just posted all the lecture notes on Carmen and I wrote them down and studied them from there. Nice lady, did not find lecture very useful. Found that many people had the same experience, but I still recommend going the first few weeks to see for yourself.
Dr. Aboughazi was very prepared and on schedule. She cared about her students and always finished material on time. If you do all of the practice problems and practice midterms you will do okay on exams. The first exam is hard, second easy, third medium and the final is hard.
Dr. Aboughazi is a charming woman who lectures well. She is good at breaking things down and always put the abstract concepts in understandable context. She is fairly easy-going, and likes to joke around a bit. She also has an accent but it never once got in the way of my understanding. I like math, so I may be biased, but her course was enjoyable.
Dr. Aboughazi clearly cares about math and does her best to explain things well, but lectures became pointless. Her notes are posted online and she just explains them in her lectures. If you have questions, feel free to go to the lectures, but recitation is more beneficial.
She seemed nice enough but I found her lectures unclear and unorganized. The book problems helped me prep for the tests but the quizzes were killer because the questions always seemed to be way out of left field. Maybe it's because I had a bad TA, but with this class I had to do a lot on my own.
She is a great prof. She's very accommodating and her teaching style is organized.
I can't understand what is she talking about during classes. I attended most classes before midterm 2, but I gave up because of her. She doesn't write anything during class but uses her previous lecture notes. Although she uploaded her notes on Carmen, it still be difficult to get an A.
It is very hard to understand what she is saying.  Even so, she seems to typically find the most complicated way to solve an equation. Recitation is important and where you'll learn the most.
Unorganized, hard to follow and understand. Did not prepare students well for quizzes.
Sometimes has no idea what she is even talking about, gets sidetracked very easily and although her accent is not hard to understand it caused some confusion when she is explaining things. However the way the class is set up you have some help with the grades, but the tests are heavily weighted and very hard.
Dr. Aboughazi was a wonderful and quirky Math 1150 professor. She does have an accent but it's really easy to understand. She is knowledgeable about the material and was very good at explaining everything.  Not too difficult because there are clear things you can do to help yourself understand the material. I suggest doing book problems.
She is constantly trying to get people involved with the lecture, by asking questions. She has an accent, but is very easy to understand. She is a sort of motherly figure, and is very knowledgeable. I never absolutely dreaded attending. Definitely attend lecture, it will help immensely.
Professor Aboughazi knows what she's doing. She has an accent which took a little getting used to but not hard to understand. She's always more than willing to answer questions if you contact her. Really a sweet lady if you get to know her too! Do the review problems on the course page and thats basically the exams.
Teacher name: Rumsey, Deb
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Professor Rumsey wants to see you succeed. Go to class she explains things well and is willing to help outside of class. For the midterm and final do all the problems on Carmen. Recitation can be done at home. My TA didn't speak English very well so I had to learn a lot by yourself. The M&amp;S Lab were not very willing or helpful with my questions.
The recitations were not helpful because it was just an hour long period where the tas neither taught or answered questions in a helpful manner. Notes were super unorganized and her midterm/final consisted of questions that were mention once in the notes. Don take stats here. Take the class at Columbus state where you get credit for 1430 and 2320!
Dr. Rumsey is one of the most caring professors I have met at OSU. She wants all of her students to succeed. She has great music taste and is extremely passionate about football. If you take her, you will not regret it. Statistics wasn't that challenging because she makes everything clear during lectures.
Definitely would recommend Dr. Rumsey. She cares about her students success and is really funny in lecture so theyre not boring. One midterm and cumulative final which are decently hard but overall the class wasnt extremely hard.
If you did well on midterm you prolly will get a good grade in the end. However, the midterm only covers a little bit what actual course material is. You don't even have to study the worksheets she gave you. I studied really hard on the worksheets and failed on the midterm lol
Deb was a great teacher but goes a little fast with lectures. Honors seemed as easy as regular and she made it even fun at some points. Like most courses, exams were a big part of the grade so study hard since recitations and participation barely do anything for your grade.
Dr. Rumsey was a good professor, that was helpful to students that reached out. You have to attend her lectures, but she provides guided notes that you have to follow along with. The tests were both pretty difficult, but she provides plenty of material to study and prepare for both of them. Only take this class if you are already a business student
Dr Rumsey is the best lecturer I've had. She really interacts with the class and tries to get to know you. She truly wants everyone to succeed and cares about her students. She's amazing def take her class if you can
Beware: the worksheets and homework are very easy; but, they are only worth about 15% of the total grade. The midterm was semi-difficult (avg. C) and it's worth 35% of your final grade. I got a C+ on the midterm and went from a 96% to an 85%. Even if I get 100% on the final, I will not be able to get an A in the class /: Best advice: go to class!
She is a great lecturer. The work can be kind of tricky, but if you're analytical you should get at least an easy B+. Mandatory Recitation.
Dr. Rumsey is a great stats professor. She's pretty funny and her lectures are very easy to understand.
Best big class Ive ever had at osu. If you put in just a little extra effort youre definitely going to succeed in this class. So many resources to reach out to and a lot of opportunities to boost your grade. Its just great
Go to recitation or you will not learn anything. Recitation grades and the carmen quizzes will save your grade because the exams are worded so poorly and are hard. I know exactly what to do on every recitation and in every carmen quiz and then got to the exam and felt so lost. Make sure you go to lecture because they take note checks in recitation.
Awesome lady!! Cares about her students and is willing to go over concepts until students understand them. Cares about how students feel about their recitation TAs as well which is soooo important! Gives you all the resources you need to succeed. Also starts class with fball vids which is so fun. No textbook needed!
Deb starts every lecture with football highlights and is genuinely engaged and invested in our learning. She makes a lecture hall feel like a classroom. Good teacher, great person! Lectures optional but recitations mandatory.
Dr. Rumsey is extremely intelligent and knows her stuff. Lectures are super boring, but it is stats, what do you expect? I recommend going because filling out the note outlines is the whole point of the class. Recitations are where you really learn the material. Midterm and Final are 70% of the grade, but have no surprises on them.
Lectures involved just copying what she wrote on the board. If you print out the notes and just fill them in, class goes quickly. Only midterm and final which I barely studied for.
As long as you attend every lecture and study the notes, this class should be an easy A.
Stats 1430 is not not difficult at all. Her Exams are basically from the notes. Exams are 70% of your final grade and there will be questions worded poorly. Best way to learn is by attending every recitations. Recitations will save your grade. HW is not bad at all. Just 10 questions quizzes on carmen.
Stats 1430 is not extremly difficult but the lectures from Professor Rumsey are alright. Her notes are structured so you have to print out blank slides online before class and fill them in. She doesnt upload complete notes as well. 70% of the class grade is based off 2 exams. Recitation is not bad and helpful but her class could be better
Teacher name: Christobek, Mar
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I had Cristobek for BUSMGT 3230 and he was the reason I almost dropped out of OSU. I graduated and have had an incredible career in technology consulting and entrepreneurship. The limitations he put on students, the way he embarrassed people in class, it was like his students were soldiers who never signed up for the army. Very ineffective.
I've had Dr. Christobek for this and BUSMGT 3230.  He was probably great in "Industry" but he can't teach.  This class was extremely difficult and he is a VERY STRICT grader.  He told our class after one assignment that if we turned in this quality of work in the real world we'd be fired from our jobs.  Well that reflects his teaching abilities.
Professor Christobek is by far my favorite professor. Sure, he is tough and expects a lot from students, but if you follow the directions and rules, it's an easy A. You should be prepared to study and ask lots of questions to ensure you understand all the material, but if you do this, you will succeed.
This guy has an ego, and he is very easy to dislike.  Go to his classes because he will tell you what version of the project you are doing in class and nowhere else.  He and his teaching partner will fail you if you mess up any of the formatting or version guidelines for the projects.  Test aren't bad, but make sure you study. Textbook useless.
Mark is very nice, but not a good teacher. It is difficult to learn the material. Exams, especially the final, are very detailed and most of the questions were barely touched upon in class. He's not terrible, but I would try avoiding him as a professor if possible.
He is meant to be in the real world working in industry and not teaching.  With that said he tries his best and is a very nice and funny guy.  Class itself wasn't that difficult except the final was more difficult than anything else.  Takes forever returning grades but other than that I would take another class with him again.
Professor Christobek  always has time and willingness to help. He truly wants that the student understands the subject. His tools for study, such as power points, additional practice exercises and etc. , are extremely helpful. Grading period extremely short and grading criteria clear.I will strongly recommend this class.
Not sure where others were getting this rude vibe from because he was more than willing to work with students. His teaching style can be a bit dry, but he wasn't bad. I do agree about the typos though. The number of clarification emails sent as a result of typos can be a bit annoying.
Avoid him at all costs. Arrogant, rude, strict (on things that make zero impact to him or other students) and much more.  He is by far the worst professor I've ever had.  It's a shame that he teaches at this university.  I got a decent grade in the class (B+) and I still think he's terrible. Good luck.
Preaches professionalism while making tons of errors in everything he made. Preaches business environment and to treat the class like a job, yet he shows up in flip flops and yells at students standing 3 ft away in class.  Oh the hypocrisy
Mark Christobek was one of the worst professors I've had at Fisher. He clearly had a superiority complex and was rude during class. Also kept referencing what was done "in industry" but he bases it off of industry in the 1990's. Easy material, but be prepared to teach yourself and watch out for typos, he doesn't edit his assignments well.
What a jub. This guy can't explain anything. Class is relatively easy. He knows the information, but he is unorganized and doesn't really know how to convey the information to students. DON'T TAKE! worst teacher at Fisher
He's a power hungry son of a gun who has an irrational fear that everyone cheats. If you don't do assignmentsquizzes EXACTLY how he wants it you get a zero. He's a nice guy outside of class, but I wouldn't recommend him as a professor.
I am disgusted that this guy represents Ohio State. He is rude and has a complete disrespect for students. By far the most unapproachable professor I've ever had. He has some major power issues, and likes to control all of the students actions in the classroom. This guy makes me question the quality of the Fisher staff. He needs to be fired.
By far the worst professor I've had so far at OSU, there is no guidance as to what will be on the weekly quizzes and he acts as though everyone in the room is beneath him. If you have any choice DO NOT take him for this class.
Klinker teaches lecture and Christobek does recitation but has no idea what was went over in lecture. Quizzes are pretty tough but manageable. Group projects are time consuming and really hurt my grade. Hopefully they change the format
He is on a huge power trip.  He has no respect for students and runs class like it's high school. His rules? No hats, no sunglasses, no electronics, don't sit in the back row or the end seats, don't look down, don't look at the ceiling, etc. Although he looks at the ceiling the ENTIRE class. Also... WHAT EXCEL BASED CLASS DOESN'T ALLOW ELECTRONICS?
Probably one of the most boring recitations ever taken. He too teaches with his eyes shut. He's slow and boring and if it wasnt for Klinker and his lectures, this class  would have been a nightmare.
Follow the class rules and you won't have any problems. The course is fast-paced but the material is not difficult to study and can even be interesting. He is willing to help you prepare for quizzes and with case assignments
Class with Mark isn't too bad, stay on top of the online quizzes and do the homework. If you have a question, speak up bc there is participation. Overall much better than I expected after reading other reviews. He gives a lot of good study tools for the tests.
Teacher name: Pappas, Barbara
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She was rather scatterbrained at times and would switch from joyful to serious in the blink of an eye. Kind of unnerving. To be fair though she always had faith that I would pass and I did.
Chem 1210 is a hard class, but Professor Pappas is a fantastic professor. She was very good at explaining things and went over a ton of problems in class. Asked and listened to our feedback about tests and our understanding of the material. If you study, go to class, and do the work, you can get a good grade
Personality is interesting enough, but sometimes gets confusing. She gets hard to follow, at times going quick and scatterbrained making it hard to pick out important information. A little time out of class going over material helps, esp example problems-j get them down bc she goes so fast in lecture u don't have to understand but go over later
Dr. Pappas is visibly passionate &amp; excited about chem &amp; that really helped my outlook on the course. gen chem is designed to REALLY push you to be an independent learner. She's funny &amp; nice, but pretty scatterbrained, so you 100% CANNOT rely solely on lecture if you want a good grade. Read the chapter before lecture, and GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!
Dr. Pappas usually gaves pretty entertaining lectures and her practice exams online were really helpful. The only problem I had with her was that she would sometimes give incorrect information during lecture and it would be really confusing when she would try and correct it.
She puts notes online and those are helpful
Dr. Pappas is very nice, however, the tests were what killed me in this class. I've never had problems with chemistry before, but ended up having to withdraw from this class after failing the first two midterms. Try to take with a prof with easier exams
AMAZING! best chemistry professor; hilarious and smart. Very clear and energetic. Does a lot of experiments in class which are always fun. Definitely take her class but be prepared to put in the work, it's no easy A.
Very funny, Reasonable with material covered in amount of time. exams taken during class period which is a major plus! Make sure to do the homework or else you wont make it.
Dr. Pappas is like Ms. Frizzel from the magic school bus. She has a crazy personality that will make  you listen to the things she says. I never took ap chem but I did well in her class. TAKE HER. SHE IS GREAT
I had 1210 with Dr. Pappas and liked her so much I made sure to get into her 1220. I'm glad I did, many people now in 1220 say they wish they chosen her earlier for 1210. She's funny and her lectures make sense, exams are straightforward and her practice exams do prepare you. She is very easy to recommend. Got an A in her 1210, doing well in 1220
I would ABSOLUTELY 100% recommend taking chemistry with Dr. Pappas. The class is hard because the class is hard, but if you go to lecture and study the material, she never throws curve balls on the exam. I knew what to expect on every exam, and did well on all of them except the one I didn't study for (duh). TAKE HER CLASS!
TAKE DR. PAPPAS! Her tests are straight-forward, I missed a two questions on the exam because  I over-thought them. 11 people got a 100% on one exam. If you have taken AP Chemistry, 1210 will be a cake walk. 1220 is a little bit harder, but still super manageable.
This class is made to be hard, so whoever you have it's going to be hard. But she made it bearable and gave us all the resources to do well (multiple practice exams, online homework, specific EOC questions). I ended up with a C which I wasnt so happy about but I'm not a good test taker, which your grade is basically based upon (62.5% to be exact)
Dr. Pappas is a great professor. Lots of industry experience. She is hilarious and frequently cracks jokes to make lectures bearable. Tests aren't easy but also aren't the hardest I've seen for 1210. Go to lecture, pay attention and study your notes and you should be fine.
This class is hard.  She is confusing and her exams are very difficult. Practice problems will not help you on exams, neither will her office hours (which I went to frequently) I am amazed that I passed this class. Lab, online homework, and recitation are what saved me. I failed every midterm despite studying almost every day. The curve is a joke
Dr. Pappas is very passionate about teaching and loves to have her students involved! Her exams are difficult but as long as you go to class and do extra practice problems that she provides you will be fine!
This class is known to be hard but Dr. Pappas is really entertaining in lecture. Obviously the tests are difficult but that is expected. Dr. Pappas is a cooky teacher and loves to do experiments in class.
Dr. Pappas is an overall good professor. She has a very lively, wacky personality which I feel is a must to be any kind of professor! She also has extensive experience in industry, so she brings plenty of real world examples to lecture. Pound for pound, I'd say she's the best gen chem professor at OSU
Pappas is seriously an amazing professor. She is super enthusiastic and always willing to help! Chem in general is terrible, however, she makes it interesting. Would definitely suggest her!
Teacher name: Taylor, Robin
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Taylor is a great biology professor. No boring powerpoint presentations; she actually lectures and knows her material front to back. Literally type/write down EVERYTHING she says because it will probably show up on the exams in some form. Her exam questions are tough and thorough; study your notes and you will do fine.
Best professor I've ever had. Took 1114 as a freshman. You need to attend almost every lecture because you get bonus points and midterm questions are created from SPECIAL material covered in lecture (not in book). Be thorough with your lab worksheets and writing assignments. Write down IFAT questions and study them. Review the textbook. I got an A.
Dr. Taylor was one of the best professors I've had at this university. She was very funny and passionate about biology and focused on teaching students to "think like a biologist," which I believe is more useful than facts in a textbook. You'll need to show up to class, but she keeps you on your toes, so you won't have to worry about falling asleep
You need to attend lecture to pass this class. All test questions come from her lectures so make sure you take great notes and write down EVERYTHING from examples to side comments. Tests can be tricky but once you start thinking from her perspective, they become easier. Don't slack on lab either because you want those points.
I really wouldn't recommend this class. Bio 1114 was supposed to be easier than Bio 1113, but I didn't think so. Like others say, her lectures are rather sloppy. She forgets what's on her slides and easily gets distracted which leads her off onto random tangents. However, she is really passionate about biology and helping students, but be warned.
Lecture is SUPER IMPORTANT! You get extra credit for going.  Her tests aren't hard if you know the concepts so that you can apply them.  Highly recommend her study method - outline and make up a fake test, then take it.  When I made regular flashcards I got a B, but doing her method got me A's
I would not recommend Dr. Taylor to anyone. Her lectures are very sporadic and she flies through the material. I will read the book and it doesn't help me on tests whatsoever. Her questions can be very tricky and even after all the studying I have done, the best test score I have received is a 75.
Very unclear and skips around. We would be on one topic then go back to one we previously talked about then skip back ahead of where we were. She expects everyone to think the way she does. The book does not help very much in her class. Though she was sporadic in her teaching methods, the exams were easy. Knowing IF-ATs help your score on exams.
Very passionate about biology, very engaging, and if you go to lecture the exams are not hard. Highly recommend if bio is something typically boring for you.
She's definitely super passionate about biology, no one can dispute that. Her lectures were super energetic. All of her questions come from lecture, so you definitely need to attend. No need to buy the book. Her class was pretty easy for me. Bio1114 is all about the big picture, keep that in mind, and you'll do great.
Dr. Taylor is knowledgeable and passionate about biology; however, her class is SO FRUSTRATING. She expects a much higher knowledge than a 1000 level course requires, and she makes you feel dumb for not meeting those expectations. It's essential to learn her ways, in order to pass. Attendance not mandatory, but points are awarded by answering Qs.
Dr. Taylor can be a little eccentric at times, but it is obvious that she loves teaching biology.  She is funny and wants her students to succeed.  Her exams come straight from the lectures, so read over the notes a few times and you will do fine.
Not only was Dr. Taylor distractible, but she was also just downright rude at times to many students. Makes it tough to participate and ask questions because she may ridicule you for certain answers or questions. Not a great professor and would avoid as she makes the class harder than it needs to be.
Everything in this class had to do with the wording. You have to understand the concept. Lectures are sporadic.
1) You have to attend lectures because every question is off her lecture slides which and what she says 2) You won't have enough time to write everything down 3) Reading the book won't help much  4) Extremely sporadic.  5) Your grade won't depend on how well you know biology, but how well you can interpret her questions 6) Won't help MCAT prep
Terrible lecturer.  Questions are purposefully written to be convoluted.  The lab for this class is quite interesting and fun--lecture on the other hand is what I imagine hell is like.  Avoid at all costs.
I'm not sure about all of the hate she's been receiving. I'm an average student at best, and I loved here class. She's super funny and the lectures are interesting.   Note that you DO have to go to class, and really understand what she's saying. This isn't a "memorize and get by" class. In fact, there is very little to actually memorize.
She is so interested in bio, it's scary. However, she doesn't know how to teach. She goes off topic a lot during lectures and asks about them on exams... Expects you to read chapters word for word. She won't even answer some of the questions asked in lectures... TAs can be really helpful to get through, especially Tony.
Taylor's Biology in Cinema class was an interesting way to get a natural science credit. I did not put full effort into this class and still got a B, which is a good sign of a fair class. She's a pretty good teacher, though scatter brained at times. Tests are pretty tough; participating and doing the rest of the assign's will insure a good grade.
Super interesting professor, really cares about the class. She's such a nice lady
Teacher name: Tansky, Judith
School name: The Ohio State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Judith Tansky was one of my favorite professors at OSU. I've gone on to have a nice career in entrepreneurship and it was during her courses that I realized what I wanted to do and how I was going to do it. While other students around me seemed to find her courses difficult, they made perfect sense to me. I plan to audit her courses in the future.
This class is a joke. Attend lecture and take good notes. The exam is easy if you pay attention in class. If you have a good TA, you'll get an A in this class. Having said that, Tansky is a terrible professor. Nothing more needs to be said that hasn't been. She's a terrible presenter and breaks every rule that you'll be forced to follow
Dr.Tansky is an ok professor. She just leads a once a week short lecture , which is easy to follow. Attend every lecture , take good notes and the final is actually easy. Fisher students really over exaggerate how hard this class is. It is mostly based on recitation=presentation and ethics game case studies.
There is no reason for you to look at reviews, she is the only professor for this subject. She may be unclear but the course is entirely based on your TA except for the final.
Absolutely the lousiest, most non-competent professor ever existed here in Fisher. For a presentation class, she is beyond laughable when it comes to engaging interest. Bring your ipad/iphone whatever just to stay awake cause god bless you, no amount of coffee will keep you awake in this class. Even my grandma could tell better stories. Scam.
Nothing new to add. She is terrible the class is useless, and EthicsGame is a scam. It doesn't matter how much you study for the final because it is completely random and meaningless information. Grades are entirely subjective. Another poor professor and class brought to you by Fisher College of Business. Growing more disappointed each quarter.
Honestly one of the worst professors I have had at OSU.  I don't know for the love of me how she is a doctor.  She is a horrible teacher, she seems to be confused when trying to teach the class. Her organization is laughable, and she has no idea how to convey material to students.  I don't think she knows what she is doing. OSU should fire her.
She stinks, but bless her heart she tries. All of the previous comments are pretty much right on. She doesn't tell you that attendance is mandatory and doesn't ever hint that there is a sign in sheet. The final isn't hard content-wise, but as previously stated, what makes it so difficult is that no one has clear-cut notes to sufficiently study.
Tansky tries hard, but cannot seem to figure out how to teach this class.  She rambles on in lecture and no one is sure whether to be taking notes on what she is saying or not. Her final is known to be incredibly tough, not because the material is hard, but because no one knows what to study.  Good luck trying to take accurate notes to study from.
She doesnt know what she is talking about and the class is very boring. You should get a good TA because my TA was so harsh on grading. She literally took 10 points for grammar errors in a 50 point essay. The class is the most worthless class I ever took in OSU
The class is not hard, but the final is pretty difficult. Go to all lectures, write good &amp; specific notes (bring a laptop for notes), esp. when speakers come in. Treat the group presentations seriously &amp; work hard on them to score well. Tansky is nice but needs to retire or to write a better final. Grade's mostly TA-based; good luck w/ a nice TA.
Although the EthicsGame isn't that useful, it's not hard to learn to game the system by the final. Lots of chances to practice groupwork and public speaking. The Harvard Business Review article was amazingly insightful, but most people didn't read it, which is why discussion sucked. Tansky likes to build relationship with students outside of class.
It's kind of ironic that Fisher would allow someone so horrendous as public speaking teach a class on public speaking. She was hard to understand, unorganized, and seemed to lack any interest in actually teaching. She forced us to buy an online simulation that was a total waste of money and time. All you can really do is pray for a good TA.
She is nice, but it is time for her to retire and enjoy a cruise or some exotic vacation far, far away from Fisher.  This class is extremely unorganized, a complete waste of my money... as well as a waste of my time and brain cells.  I ended up learning NOTHING in this course!  Fisher, what is the point? Hello?
one of the most useless classes I have ever had. she literally repeat the same lecture for three times. the final (i just took) was the worse. too much to write, not enough time (&lt; 1 hour ). and she expect us to read her mind (there is a standard answer for ethical case study and she made it short answer questions). and she is a terrible speaker.
She is the worst professors i have ever had. she doesnt know how to teach the material. just hope you get a good ta because you are going to fail the final, if you dont youre in trouble. What makes this even more entertaining is that she teaches a public speaking class and has no idea how to speak in public. what was fisher thinking hiring her.
Lectures were beyond useless and completely boring. She's a terrible speaker and she will randomly ask dumb questions that she herself doesn't even know the answers to. Recitation was easy but had lots of busywork (you want an easy grading TA). If you do well in recitation, you can still pull off a good grade if you fail the final. Good luck!
She wasn't qualified to be a good public speaking. Tons of "ah uhm." The final was kind of hard. The recitation wasn't that bad. Good luck to u all. Avoid her if u can.
Her teaching is all over the place and she seems to get off-track frequently, but its only a 48 minute lecture/week and she's very interested in what students think. Just get a good TA and pay attention to the speakers for the final.
Recitation attendance required. Lectures very boring, but you need the notes to pass the final exam. Pay attention to the Hosner model and guest speakers. Got an A before the final (82%), and final grade was A-. Easy A-, but very difficult A (she even tells you this, too). They're changing the book starting fall. It'll no longer be 'Good to Great')
Teacher name: Odish, Faris
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is a really awesome professor and caring. Only thing he ever did wrong was not teach my calc 3 and diff. Eq. Class. Actually almost teared up leaving his class the last day of my class because i had him for calc 1 and 2.
Odish is the GOAT of all math teachers at ASU. Took Calc in high school and I was really confused, but he made Calc 2 feel like a 1 credit class, explaining complex concepts very well. If you pay attention and listen in class, the homework is like review and the tests/quizes are quite easy. If only he teaches Calc 3 and every math class at ASU...
I took Calculus BC during high school so this class was super easy, but Professor Odish really did a great job with going through each concept with multiple examples. He's really funny and might roast you in class. One thing is that he may or may not announce quizzes but they usually fall right after finishing a topic.
Professor Odish is an alright professor. With his strict T/A and 1-2 quizzes a week (out of three sessions a week) you quickly realize that it can become hard to keep up. He only uses Webwork for homework which is a free program. Try to get a professor who utilizes web-assign, a paid program, free with purchase of textbook, it's much better.
It might take a bit to warm up to this teacher, but when you do, you'll realize how great a math teacher he is. He cracks funny jokes, gives out good, helpful lectures, and you can really just tell he cares about each and every one of the students, which he makes clear throughout the course. Best Calc II teacher on campus.
First day of class I walked in and was like "damn, it's just an old dude." Can't believe I was so quick to judge. This man is amazing at what he does--just silence your phone before class.
He starts the semester off tough to weed out the students who don't care. After the first few weeks, he starts cracking jokes and you can tell he cares about his students. Gives adequate warning for quizzes and exams, and does a thorough review before each exam. Amazing teacher.
Take Odish for Calc and he will make sure you understand calculus. All the criticism of him is just because he can be strict, but he truly cares about his students and wants them to do well while also learning the concepts. The tests and quizzes are easy if you pay attention in class and make sure to do all the homework to maximize your points.
Odish cares immensely about his students. The first couple weeks he acts tough to scare away bad students. Once you get deep into the semester, you'll find him cracking jokes. Lots of quizzes, but he always gives you a heads up and lets you what type of problems will be on there. He always tells you exactly what to expect on the exams.
Verg good professor. I took him for calc 1 and 2 and have such a good understanding of it thanks to him.
Odish comes off as a rude old man but he is actually really caring and goes over many example problems to make sure you understand. He makes sure to go over the fundamentals of calculus to also help you actually understand. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN.
Amazing Calc II Professor. Highly recommend. Don't miss a lecture as everything builds from the previous lecture. Weekly quizzes so be prepared, usually on a Friday
Professor Odish truly cares about his students and wants them to learn. This is my second semester taking him in a row and has made calculus 1 and 2 my favorite courses i have taken in my career at ASU. You will definitely learn calculus.
Odish is favorite prof this semester Lays out ground rules on the first day and it seems like he'll be a grumpy prof, but he really loves math and tries to make his lectures entertaining I didnt buy the textbook because homework is online. Homework is abit much sometimes. Quiz about every two weeksbut theyre like in class problems Taking him again!
Hard to understand. Poor teaching, its better to get a tutor or teach yourself the material.
I took Dr. Odish over the summer for Calc 2. By far the best Math professor I've ever had. Dr. Odish can make anything in Calculus feel easy for his students. Although very strict and sometimes harsh, Dr. Odish actually has a big heart and will do all he can to help, just ask nicely.
Best Math teacher i've ever had, straight to the point and thorough with notes.
good teacher but tough grader.
Dr. Odish is amazing. He cares for his students. He is definitely a great math teacher and the best at ASU. He knows what he is teaching in and out. Definitely take him for Calc1 and 2 and your concepts will be very strong.
Highly recommend taking Dr. Odish whether you just need Math for credits or if it is a really important part of your major .

Teacher comments: 
really funny guy and pretty fun lectures. An A is 87%, and theres only 4 exams (lowest gets dropped) and 10 unproctored online quizzes (all on quizlet). Go to lectures because a lot of the videos and material mentioned in lecture are on the exams. he gives you study guides and if you study that the night before the exam you'll do fine. Easy A
Loved this class! The study guide is literally the test, very clear expectations. He's funny and very good at explaining things. The tests are 100% of the class grade, but they aren't very hard and extra credit is offered.
Dr. Short was a really funny guy, but he would often skim over the material in class and would leave most of the teaching up to online modules that take forever. His tests were pretty easy and he drops the lowest score which is nice, and he also gives you some answers right before the test.
This class is super easy and Dr. Short is by far the best professor to have for it. Class is on,y one day a week and you really dont ever need to go unless theres a test, but Dr. Short is a great lecturer. Quizlet is your best friend.
His class can be challenging at first because it is only based off of 3 tests. There are 4 total, but one gets dropped. His lectures are very entertaining and are recommended going to because some test questions are based off these in person lectures. However, if you put in basic effort, you will be able to succeed.
Most of his homework/online quizzes are accessible on Course Hero or Quizlet. Lectures are very interesting between the exciting information and professor. Tests are pretty tough but has a very fair grading scale I got an 88% which is still considered an A.
Super funny guy that makes the material interesting and easy to digest. The only grades in the class come from four 50 question exams with the lowest being dropped. He does give some extra credit opportunities throughout the semester. Great class.
Only meet once a week, weekly quizzes were a pain but easy points to boost grade tests pretty much follow the study guides he gives, just make sure to pay attention to boring in class videos as well as examples he does in class. Get the study participation requirement done early before all the spots fill up.
He is a funny professor. Showing up to class is optional, but you will want to show up because some things he says in class is included in the exams. Very easy and interesting class. He challenges you to think critically
Dr. Short was a great Social Psych professor! I liked his class so much that I took another class of his (Positive Psych) in the summer. I would recommend him as a professor to any psychology or non-psychology major.
Hes funny, but you wont LOVE the content in this class. He shows some videos in class and puts them on the test to check for attendance, so if you dont show up, the highest grade you can get is 80%. He drops the lowest test grade (only 4) but you shouldnt rely on it. Otherwise, his class is pretty manageable.
Nothing against Dr. Short, but this classes grade is based off of 3/4 exams. Having 4 grades leaves zero room for error, do bad on one exam and it'll be hard to end up with an A. DO NOT SKIP CLASS or you're toast.
Dr. Short is a cool guy. I got an 87% in his class, which is considered an A. Take advantage of the EC opportunities as the tests are pretty hard. I got a C on almost every one of them and still somehow wound up with an A.
His class is okay. It was hard because it's a LOT of memorization. He gives four exams and drops the lowest score. No HW. His lectures are interesting, he shows a lot of videos where he takes a lot of exam questions from, so skip class the least you can. Sometimes he forgets he has international students (I am one) because he speaks way too fast.
Dr. Short is funny and clearly passionate about his field. This area does not interest me as much but if you place the extra effort to read the text book you should get an A. The videos and lectures are hilarious and you will enjoy the class regardless. There are only 4 curved exams, lowest gets dropped. He also offers 4 extra credit papers.
Very charismatic professor! He makes all his lectures very enjoyable, he tends to embed many videos in it, some of the questions from the test comes from the video. Its honestly a safe choice to do the study guide and go to review sessions!! No homework. 4 tests (drops the lowest one). Research requirement, do it early and you get extra credit.
Dr. Short is amazing! He can make a dry lecture on history interesting. He has a lot of extra credit opportunities and his As start at an 87. As long as you pay attention and do the study guilds you will do well. TAKE THIS CLASS!
He gives the best lectures! I actually liked showing up to class. Attendance is not required / no quizzes, but he shows videos that have content that will be on exams (plus he gives huge hints about exam questions)
The first test was pretty difficult, but if you do the readings and pay attention in lecture you should be able to manage a good grade on all of the tests. There is a research requirement, so get that done early to obtain the extra credit. He is an awesome professor and I highly recommend!
absolutely awesome professor, would take again! He loves social psychology and is very interesting in his delivery of the material. Fairly graded - an average of your 3 highest grades out of 4 exams. Go to class and take notes, pay close attention to the videos. Also gives 3% extra credit on top of final grade if you complete all opportunities.
Teacher name: Fey, Richard
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Fey was very interesting, cursed a lot so it made class entertaining and told many stories. He had clicker points almost every class so there was a lot of "freebies" and homeworks every week but they were only 10 true/false questions. His tests though were very hard and the study guides do not match the tests. I would not recommend him
fey is a good teacher and very passionate . he is hard on his students but only because he wants them to be responsible. clicker question every day, and 3 exams . homework due every friday but it is only 10 questions and can be done in 5 minutes . he swears a lot, and makes things interesting . i recommend him .
I had Dr. Fey for SOC 101 and the class itself was really easy. All of his tests are open note which was really nice. My problem with him was that he got off topic a lot and got really preachy about certain issues, but you can tell that he loves what he teaches. I've heard that he's the easiest professor for this class, so I would recommend him.
he was so funny and interesting just show up for the clicker questions, all exams are online and the study guide is exactly like the test
Is a great lecturer but his tests are pretty hard even with the notes he allows you to have. If you don't study you wont pass the class.
His lectures are very interesting but his test are pretty hard, you have to study to at least get a C. You can use notes on the tests but he records you. Homework can be found online so don't worry about that. Very fair professor and I look forward to taking another class with him. Just show up to class, listen, and TAKE NOTES.
So even though I got an A in his class, it was a pretty frustrating one. The test information comes from three different sources: the online textbook, lectures, and DIS articles. So, in other words, if you actually do the reading and go to lectures, it's a good 10+ hours a week. However, the tests follow his study guides which makes it a lot easier
Loved his class! His lectures were very interesting, but make sure to sit more towards the front to stay focused. If you read the textbook (which takes a long time), you'll definitely do well in the class. He gets very sensitive about people leaving during class though!
Class was not my favorite subject but Fey is really funny and really passionate professor. The class overall is not that hard and the tests allow for notes during the test. Even though you dont click into class everyday everything said and shown during lectures may be on the test so be sure to go to class
I really enjoyed going to Dr. Fey's lectures. He is a great storyteller. Many questions on the test are from the lectures so make sure you go!
The class was massive but he did a good job of keeping it engaged and answering questions. He gives some questions from the test in class so definitely go. There are clicker questions so you have to attend class. The homework is easy and tests are multiple choice but definitely be prepared going into it because its a vast majority of the grade.
The weekly homework was 10 T/F questions. Only 3 exams (not cumulative). He is strict on deadlines because he has over 1,000 students so he doesn't do exceptions. He doesn't give homework 2 weeks prior to a test and is very generous by giving study guides. Attendance is not mandatory but he does use the clickers as participation.
Fey is a good guy who understands that this is a 101 level course and actually taught it that way. All of the homeworks were on quizlet and all the tests had study guides. As long as you pay attention in lecture and take good notes for the open note tests you will be fine.
Dr Fey is wonderful and has a solid sense of humor. His lectures are interesting but you often dont grasp whats important. His tests are VERY difficult and unrelated- the best I did (and I did 10 pages of the study guide) was a C. Go to class for group projects to make sure it boosts your grade.
His class is super easy as long as you show up, listen to his lectures, read the textbook, do hw (once a week), and do the study guides for his tests. 3 exams. He cancels class pretty frequently, so be wary of that. One of the easiest classes I've ever had to do no work for. Just study before the test &amp; you will be fine.
Fey only gives one homework assignment a week and the exams are easy enough, go to lecture and do the study guides with your notes and the textbook and you'll get an A. Definitely recommend, Fey's lectures are very engaging and he is hilarious.
I really respect Professor Fey as a person, but I hated this class! His exams are done on the lockdown browser which is annoying, and they're full of TRICK QUESTIONS. The study guides were too long and full of material that was distracting. The lectures were interesting &amp; homework was easy but his exams were not a good reflection of the material.
Lectures are a waste of time but he uses clickers so you have to go to class. Content is simple and if you just find everything on the study guide, you'll pass the exams easy. Exams are online, open note. Homework due every week but it takes less than 20 minutes. He's fairly entertaining as far as lecturers go. He's chill.
Lots of trick questions on homework and tests, he breezes thru topics in class without any explanation where it's needed, gets sidetracked often, and doesn't prepare you for his tests which are 1/2 of your grade. For being in class 3 days a week, I'm not sure how he managed to teach so little. Definitely have to teach yourself here, nice guy tho.
There is 6 class assignment in total, and make sure you go to class everything. There is a final paper due at the end of the semester, and as long as you follow the instructions, you can easily get full points. Exams are hard, please study ahead of the time and make a good note from the lecturer and textbook.
Teacher name: McCarthy, Matthew
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Honestly, one of the best professors that I have taken in my 3 years at ASU. You won't want to skip a single class because of how interesting his lectures are. The excel assignments can be a pain but the quizzes and exams are open book and open notes. There is no way to not get an A in this class.
One of the best professor in the entire campus. He's hilarious and gives straightforward lectures. He will point out specific topics that are on exams and offers generous extra credits. As long as you study and put in the work, CIS 105 is an easy A. He doesn't respond to emails; therefore, you can only contact him at his office hours or in class.
Might just be the best teacher out of all the Campuses. A MUST take, for a rich and fun college experience.
Loved this class. I had McCarthy for my CIS 105 course and he made my first semester. Totally recommend!
Excellent professor, his lectures were always interesting. I genuinely looked forward to going to his classes. Assignments were on Prometheus, and multiple choice. Learned so much from this class, I wish I could take him again next semester. Highly recommend!!!
He is very funny and interesting to listen to. However, going to class is completely unnecessary the assignments are very easy to complete without attending.
Does knowledge checks in class and lets you use the textbook for the midterm and final. Really enjoyed this class!
His part of CIS 105 was very relaxed. You don't neex to attend lectures, although he does do the knowledge checks with you at the end of class instead of doing them for hw. The multiple choice exams are mostly searchable.
Loved McCarthy! Course Syllabus lets you know what and when assignments are due. Make sure to go to lectures, he makes them fun and engaging. Weekly knowledge checks and microsoft excel/access assignments (go to class it helps). Only exams are midterm and final. You'll be sure to laugh during his lectures.
Professor McCarthy is approachable. He gives great lectures by applying textbook knowledge to our professional lives. He emphasizes what is on the test through his lectures, so I would recommend attending every class. Also, provides plenty of opportunities for extra credit.
Super sarcastic, funny guy. He does all the homework in class, and lets you use your textbook on all the exams. Just don't cheat or get up and leave during the middle of class and there won't be any problems.
McCarthy can be a difficult person but he's chill overall. Just show up, chances are he'll basically give you the answers for the knowledge checks. There's no reason to get below a B in this class honestly just show up and do the work.
Super funny, does homework in class. Dont need to show up to do hw though, all answers are online.
Honestly, this is going to be one of the easiest classes you take because of how the class is set up. Show up and you will get all the answers to your homework in the lecture!
Amazing professor, his lectures were helpful not only for the exams, but they apply to real life. Gives great advice and stimulates thinking.
Professor McCarthy is hilarious in his lectures and supports the students who work their hardest. He completes most of the homework assignments in class, so it benefits you to attend the lectures. Also, he offers lots of extra credit. However, he does not like emails, so the best way to ask questions is either in class or office hours.
Make sure to do the work on time and dont fall behind because its a pain if you do trust me.
This course is taught by two professors, McCarthy one one day, and Wood on the other. McCarthy thoroughly explains everything and addresses each concept with a real life application, which is very helpful. He usually concludes each lecture by going through the homework with you and gives awesome tips on how to pass the midterm!
Best professor at ASU ever. You have to try to fail. Go to his lectures, they are the best and he'll let you do the quizzes in class with him. Easy grade.
McCarthy is great. He genuinely cares for his students and their grades even when he's making snarky jokes and comments. Attendance isn't taken but attending lecture will be helpful in the end! There's an assignment every week in the book but they're pretty easy. Just do your part and you should be good.
Teacher name: Whitaker, Lisa
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
The teacher seems great, maybe if a different course was taken. But SOC 101 is just a mess, she makes people "participate" which is a good effort but doesn't generate actual discussions, just people saying random pointless things. I'm very interested in sociology but thought this class was a bit of a slack.
Whitaker seems scary upfront but all she does is explain everything she wants in the beginning. Her syllabus was huge but that's because she includes all assignments, rubrics, etc so it's clear what's going on in her class. She makes for an interesting lecture that is driven by class participation. Loved that she was honest upfront.
Dr. Whitaker is a great person. She allowed me to join her class later than is usually accepted and was totally understanding about my situation. I loved her and her class. It's not hard to catch up if you miss a week or two as she does not have a midterm or final and the last 2 weeks of class were for making up quizzes. Do her study guides!
15 open-book, open-note quizzes, which is honestly busy work. Gives you the answer to the study guides for said quizzes in class, while talking about real-world application of theory. Very easy A. Caveat, though: the topics in this may offend people easily who are very conservative. So if you're easily offended, you have to brace for this class.
Dr. Whitaker is pretty fair with the way she structures her course. As long as you put in some amount of work &amp; effort, you'll get an A, no problem. There will be 5 online exams, all of which are mostly based off of her notes &amp; study guides - so don't regret not filling them out thoroughly! Also gives extra credit, such as surveys/clothes donation.
Don't be discouraged just because this is a 400-level course. Dr. Whitaker makes this upper division level class EASIER than most lower division courses! You'll have 5 easy online open-book/note exams, attendance+participation, a simple PPT presentation, &amp; extra credit. Exam questions are almost straight off her study guides/notes - FILL THOSE OUT!
She is a great professor! She cares about her students success and always has interesting lectures prepared. NO MIDTERM &amp; NO FINAL! Do the weekly study guides and tests and youll pass the class with an A. Take her please, you wont regret it!!!
She is a blast to have in class. Super funny and passionate about sociology. She requires participation which is nerve wracking because you need to speak 4 times during the semester in front of 200 people. Other than that, the class is simple as long as you put in some effort.
This is the second time I have taken this professor. She is an amazing professor who helps you out a ton! If you don't take tests/quizzes on time, there is a make-up interval at the end of the semester where you can make them up. Also, the homework tasks are super easy. You should have no problem getting an A in this course.
I LOVE LISA! There is no midterm or final. There is a quiz every week, but she gives you study guides that have the same questions as the test and you can just email the documents to yourself and then look at the answers while taking the quiz. (open note) She lets her classes out super early everyday and will randomly take down attendance points.
This is one of the easiest classes I took my freshman year. There is just one quiz per week and she gives you a study guide that you can use that has all the answers. Open book and note for every quiz. There were also around 3 extra credit opportunities throughout the semester. Very easy A. Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy class.
If you are a freshman and need a 100 level class, Lisa is the way to go. However, when you are close to graduating and taking 200-400 level classes, these classes will be a drag and an insult. Nothing against her, but I should have just taken this class at community college and transferred the credits. Just take it seriously enough to pass.
all I kept thinking during her lectures or discussions was how everything in her class reverts back to her own opinion politically, it feels pushy/uncomfortable. She is also very strict and unwilling to help with her schedule of online work being available 8am-5pm so if you're like me &amp; balancing multiple schedules her class may not be for you.
Her lectures are always interesting and informative. She is a sweet woman. Her coursework is usually pretty easy. Do some light reading of the material and fill out your study guides and you'll be good to go!
Horrible professor. Everything that came out of her was pure garbage.
Gives lots of extra credits, with weekly quizzes every Friday. Participation matters, but it's such a small portion of your grade, you can still pass the class without ever partaking in it; however, do show up for class, cause there's attendance points. Doing the study guide in this class is a must, it's word for word with the quizzes. No final.
Never really paid attention in lectures and still passed. Theres a quiz every week but it's online and you can do it in your bed. Complete the short study guide before the quiz and you'll get a 100%, it's word for word.
SUCH an easy class. I retook sociology due to having a bad prof last semester, and this was an absolute breeze in comparison. Show up for attendance points, but i'd just do other hw in class. Do the study guide; they're the exact question that'll be on the weekly online quiz. no final/midterm, lots of EC opportunities
dr whitaker is a fine prof when she teaches sociology, not political theory. i don't mind political theory, but when teaching becomes dogma, it's just miserable and most of all unproductive. i recommend using TA's who are professional and who have more experience than undergraduates.
Taking this SOC class was a great choice! She makes lectures boring sometimes but she takes attendance on random days so I suggest going. There are no tests, just weekly quizzes which she has identical study guides for. Overall, super easy class. My only complaint is that the textbook is so expensive and you need it for the readings.
Teacher name: Cabirac, Gary
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Cabirac is a well respected, funny professor, however I would not recommend him to anyone unless they're excellent at chemistry because he moves quickly and his tests are very difficult. If you would like to maintain a decent GPA, I would recommend Professor Marks for 116 as her exams are much easier. Good luck!
Dr. Cabirac will clearly explain what you have to do in order to pass his class. Read the textbook, do the practice problems, and show up for clicker questions. He's not playing around when he tells you to sit in a quiet room and practice the problems. Like Dr. Cabirac explains, CHM 116 is a very dry course and you're going to have to put in work
He know his chem but he goes at an incredibly fast pace it is hard to keep up. Clicker questions every class, his exams (3) are really difficult and there is a lot of homework. I left most classes (if not all) feeling like I didn't learn anything and it showed in the hw. If this class is not a core requirement i wouldn't take him at all
He does go really fast during the lectures, so try to keep up. If you're having difficulties, go to the discussion sessions. Don't skip class bc clicker points can boost your grade a lot. His tests are really conception based, so don't just memorize things, try to really understand what he's saying.
His exams were super hard until I figured out that if I did all the practice problems in the book then I'd do 1000x better. I had a hard time following his lectures, but I really enjoyed him as a professor. He was super involved in our facebook group, a funny guy, and really knows his stuff.
If you took AP Chem before this then it should be a breeze. Gary is hilarious and gives a very generous curve on each midterm and for your overall grade. He makes class as entertaining as he can and is extremely understanding. Go to the discussion sessions because you basically get the test in there so no need to do the practice problems.
Come to class to get some participation points that can boost your grade by a point or two. Do the practice exams, practice problems, and the conceptual assigned problems. The tests are based off a lot of given material. Cabirac makes his lectures interesting (albeit a little heavy on future material) and cares about his students.
He is a very good professor. He knows what he talking about and trying to increase the interest of the students. He knows his exams are hard, but there is always a curve after each exam (except for the final). His class is a little tough because of a lot of materials to remember.
Chemistry is a diffcult subject, so it's not going to come easy to most of us. The test are hard but he curves all of them, cumalitive final, and the clicker questions given every class for attendence makes it pivotal to show up. Use his review videos, chads reviews, and read the chapters, and practice the problems like hell and youll do ok.
great teacher verry fair. you can pass with pure understanding on tests. or if you are just a good student he gives plenty of opportunity to get the points you need to pass. i highly recommend him
THE ABSOLUTE BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD AT ARIZONA STATE!!!! seriously... I'm horrible at chemistry, it never clicked &amp; he made everything so helpful and positive to every student! He communicates and keeps you updated on everything!! Most importantly he wants you to succeed! I would never take another chemistry professor!!! HE IS THE BEST!!!
Cabirac is a brilliant and engaging professor, and he wants you to succeed. He provides ALL the necessary tools to excel: practice problems, chapter outlines, PPT slides -- use everything you can (including Chad's reviews!). It'll be hard-fought, but definitely worth it. Just keep practicing and you'll do well in his class.
Cabirac is the GOAT. His tests are hard but not too bad. And you can get your lowest test revived by the final. Would HIGHLY recommend taking CabDaddy if you can.
Dr. Cabirac was well organized and explained lecture material clearly. Unfortunately, the online homework and in class questions all focus on simple calculation based problems, while the tests are largely harder conceptual questions, making them unnecessarily difficult compared to all the practice material.
Dr. Cabirac is a very strong professor and he was a very fair grader. Everything on the exams was in the lectures, just be sure to attend class for clicker points.
Dr. Cabirac is a genius! He admits the material of this course is dry but he provides so many different types of material for studying. If you apply yourself and do all the work and the suggested problems, then you will do well. You are truly learning in this class and it prepares you for the difficulty of future chemistry classes. He also curves!
I had this professor for both CHM 113 and 116. The book is not required but it explains a lot better than he does in his lectures I would get the book. The course is very test heavy and averages tend to be very low especially for 116. However he does put a big curve on every test besides the final. He makes sure everyone in his class passes.
Chemistry is going to be a tough class whoever you take it with, but he is a great professor. He curves all the exams except the final, and sometimes curves the class. Tip: be sure to go see him in office hours to prep for exams, and do his assigned problems before the exam!!
I had a heavy background in chem before I took Dr. Cabirac's course, and that may have been what saved me. Despite this, Dr. Cabirac is a wonderful professor that cares about his students. He moves fast during lecture, and utilizes clickers to the fullest. It is a lot of work outside of lecture, but that was to be expected going in.
It was very difficult to transition from CHM113 with a different prof to Dr. Cabirac's CHM116. I believe this had to do with his lecture style and sketchy exam q's. He spends too much time talking about ochem and biochem instead of the class at hand and the conceptual q's on his tests are meant to trip you up. Godspeed to future Cabirac students.

Tough class but amazing professor. He is clear and explains things very throughly. Chemistry is super hard and I had a hard time passing but he is a great prof.
Not going to lie, the class is a little difficult. But, he's one of the best science professors you'll ever have. He gives lots of extra papers and packets in class that will help you so much. Make sure to attend class because he gives quizzes (dont worry he gives the answers at the end). A hilarious guy. Make sure to study and take notes.
He is amazing and his lectures are so interesting. If you pay attention in class and take down all the notes he gives in class you will do really good on the exams. Very nice professor and has lots of patience.
Dr. Briggs' class was one of the best chemistry classes I have taken yet. His lectures were clear and he wrote notes on the board so the pace was perfect. You have to work for the grade but his teaching and the amount of resources available for help make that easy.
I hated chemistry before taking this class but Briggs made it enjoyable and dare I say even fun. This course was definitely a challenge, but if you're willing to put in the work, you can get an A for sure. Briggs is hilarious and held my attention in every lecture. 10/10 would recommend
I have never left a review for any professor, Dr. Briggs being my first exception. This man is exceptional, his lectures are amazing, and his class is fair. I struggled with Chem throughout high school never got it. In Briggs's class, I learned that if you work diligently and use all of the resources available, an A is extremely possible. Attend SI
Dr. Briggs makes chemistry actually funny. He jokes around a ton but is also all about getting the knowledge in his students. There is a decent amount of homework so don't procrastinate, but everyone loves him even though his class is a challenging one. He makes so many resources available to students. Use them! Dr. Briggs is the best.
I have always held the opinion that chemistry is the most horrid subject ever. After this class, I still hold that opinion. Chemistry SUCKS but Briggs made it much more bearable, he is easily the funniest professor I've ever had. My complaint: the homework assignments were INSANE, I counted 76 problems for one chapter, and others had more.
If you are taking Chem 113, get this professor! His lectures are great and seem much quicker than they are. He makes his class interesting and fun to go to. Dr. Briggs is an icon and everyone loves his class. ONLY GET HIM FOR THIS CLASS!!! Plus he's funny and he cares about our success. He is amazing!!!
Briggs makes a boring chemistry lecture actually interesting and fun! There are four tests and a final and they are relatively easy if you put the work in and study and practice problems, he gives you practice exams so really use those when studying. Not a class to cram the night before but Briggs is the best professor to take CHM 113 with.
This class and his lectures were amazing!! I absolutely hate chemistry, hated the material, and all the homework sucked. But Briggs made everything worth it because not only are his lectures hilarious, but he even manages to make his exams hilarious. Best professor to take chemistry with for sure!!
Amazing!!! Take him and you will be grateful! He explains things so clearly and everything is organized so perfectly. Not to mention that he's hilarious. His exams are 95% like what he gives as practice exams. He is hands down the best 113 teacher
Wow! What a profesor! I thought I was gonna absolutley hate chemistry and it turned out to be my favorite class ever. He is so funny and teaches clearly. Exam review days are perfectly planned game shows and all kinds of cool stuff is always happening. I highly reccomend!
If you have a strong background in chem this class will be cake! If not, you'll have to put some more work into it but Briggs makes learning chem fun and easy! He provides so many resources and lectures are entertaining enough. He does gameshow style exam reviews, and the lecture quizzes are done in class.
I struggled because of who I am as a person but he gave countless resources and all types of support. He really makes chemistry super interesting and fun.
My favorite chem professor because he gives really great lectures. It's still a decently hard class but he'll make sure you understand the material as long as you're willing to put in a little bit of effort.
Very good teacher who is very air but teaches a difficult class. Chemistry is no joke and shouldn't be taken lightly, to get a good grade YOU WILL WORK FOR IT. If you are already planning on taking chem or majoring in it then Briggs is a very good choice. You will have to work in groups for labs and recitation.
One of the best professors I had in a long time. He has renewed my passion for chemistry. I would recommend attending every lecture because he can explain concepts clearly and you will see them on the test. Also, some test questions are in regards to activities that happened during lecture. Like a video he played or a class experiment so show up!
Honestly the best science teacher I have ever had, and I am a BIO Major. His lectures cover ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING that you could possibly see on the exams. He does extra credit exam questions that he assigns a few days before the test. His "exam study days" are so fun, he makes game shows. He also posts practice exams!
Really great and respected professor. Engaging lectures with lots of audio visual content. Clears doubts anytime. Do show up to lecture for the quizzes which count for 5% and he drops the two lowest. Occasionally adds points to everyone's tests. Recitation's hectic, lab's easy but that's the course. Stay on top of the MasteringChemistry Homework.
Teacher name: Gould, Ian
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Gould is easily the best professor I've ever had. This is still organic chemistry, but Dr. Gould genuinely cares so much, is accessible almost 24/7, and provides great feedback. There's a ton of homework but only around 75% of it is mandatory. Do all of it (and don't just "kinda" do it - understand every single problem).
Loved him! Took his OChem class online and yes it was really hard, but he made it doable
Dr. Gould is a phenomenal professor. Ochem can be difficult and scary but he knows how to TEACH the material so well it seems to click after some practice on the homework site. Do the homework, ask questions, take the practice exams, and you'll be golden. He's very responsive and will do everything he can to help you understand the material.
Dr. Gould is an engaging lecturer who really cares about his students' success! He has his own homework website which is an amazing tool. Pay attention to lectures, fill out the gap notes, and do as many homework problems as possible. Great teacher who gives you the resources you need to succeed.
Dr. Gould is incredible. Pay attention, take good notes, USE THE HOMEWORK SITE, ask questions. He's always happy to help. He moves pretty quickly during lectures, but they're all online, so you can go over things you may have missed or didn't completely understand. I thought this class was easier than CHM233 honestly. Graded on exams and homework.
Honestly one of the harder Ochem professors out there, but you will get something out of his class if you put the effort into it. The practice exams are ones from previous years so they are almost identical to the test ( best way to study ) and his homework is all for completion, and lectures are posted all online. Very good professor :)
Highly recommend! One of the best professors I've ever had, which is especially important for the course, one of the hardest I've ever taken. Between his homework site, Facebook support group, and videos for review sessions and explanations of problems, Dr. Gould gives you all the support you need to succeed. You get the grade that you earn.
I have learned more in Dr. Gould's class than any other class I've had in college so far. Tests are 90% of your grade, but you have all the resources that you need to succeed. If you do the homework problems and go to the review sessions, this difficult class becomes foolproof. The grade you get is definitely the grade you earn.
Gould is not an awful teacher, but he's not a saint either. Everyone tells me he's amazing, but his attitude and treatment of students this semester begs to differ. He would humiliate students in lecture and get extremely frustrated in class due to technical errors (which happen a lot). We ended up not finishing the material we need for O Chem 2.
If I could give him 6 stars I would. Everything you need to get an A is right there for you.
By far the best organic chemistry class I could have ever taken . Before Gould I had taken organic with another professor and ended up dropping. With Gould he really does give you everything you need. He has his own homework site which is free. You get credit for each question attempted regardless if you get it wrong or right. Highly recommend!
You really don't appreciate what you have until it's gone. I assure you, Dr. Gould is the BEST EVER professor there is. I am his student from last year and I miss him and his class so much. He's very caring and he WORKS HARD to help you understand, from his hw site, videos, FB group, review sessions.. the list can go on &amp; on. Appreciate him people.
Dr. Gould is by FAR the best ochem professor at ASU. Don't get me wrong, the course content is tough, but he actually helps you understand what you're doing rather than just memorizing a bunch of stuff. A little bummed he doesn't use the +/- system for grading, considering I got over 100% in his class, but whatever. He's absolutely incredible.
Professor Gould gives you all the resources to pass! I can honestly say his HW site is amazing , and the quizzes are OK and multiple choice, there are 4 test,NOT MULTIPLE CHOICE, SO YOU EITHER KNOW IT OR YOU DON'T. SO STUDY STUDY . He talks fast and writes sloppy but uploads all lectures to re watch! ALSO NO BOOK only a $20 gapped notebook AWESOME
Class is hard but if you do the homework and practice, you will do well. Dr. Gould gives you all the resources necessary to succeed in his class, its just up to you to do the work for yourself! Showing up to class isn't necessary because every lecture is recorded and posted on his course website.
I was worried about taking this course online but shouldn't have been. By far one of the easiest classes I've taken in college. Dr. Gould always emails back within 24 hours if you have any questions. If you can work his homework problems and do the practice test you are fine. If you can't understand o-chem with Dr. Gould change your major.
Dr. Gould was my favorite professor at ASU. He gives you all the tools you need to succeed (recorded lectures, recorded review sessions, homework site that drills OChem). But YOU NEED TO PUT IN THE WORK. THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT!!! He also wrote me a letter of rec and that helped me get into med school (I'm a currently a first-year med student)!
I took second semester of ochem with Gould again. Second semester is so much harder than first semester, but Gould provided us a lot of resources for us to succeed. I learned a lot in his class.
I LOVE THIS MAN SO MUCH. HE IS THE BEST.
I would give this man my first born child. 234 was way harder than 233 in my opinion, but Gould gives you everything you need to succeed. His free homework website is the only way you're going to learn the material, but I also liked going to the 2 review sessions the weekend before the exam. He is hands down the best professor you will ever have.
Teacher name: Adams, Gary
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
A little eccentric, but not as bad as they say. Homework's a lot of work, but get with a group of friends or go to the tutoring center and you'll be fine. Adams does talk a lot in class and it can be a little confusing, but he's just really passionate about the subject. He curves the final grade and posts grades consistently.
If you need to take phy101 dont take it with him!!!! DO NOT! His grading curve is weird. Exams are hard. He super strict on grading hw and everything is his way or the highway. No one will ever be able to get an A in that class! His class is more of a chem class than a phy class.
Luckily I learned physics in highschool good. I did not learn one thing from this class. I believe he tried to spit on my face when I went to his office hours. I do not miss his class.
Don't take if you can't pay attention. His goal is to iron out your misconceptions about physics, so most of the questions are trick questions. Know that and pay attention and you're set. The lecture was fun, with lots of examples, demonstrations, and engagement. He uses his own site. Lots of calculations on the homework. Must show your work.
This is one of those classes where you do ALL the learning outside of class and you are quizzed on it before you come into class. Lectures are basically useless, he will go over homework before it is due, but its not always done right. Test averages were about a 40-50%. The tests are all obscure conceptual questions with some actual problems.
I didn't expect that physics 101 would be this exhausting! I didn't like Admas because he is simply making EVERYTHING so complicated. He is a very TOUGH grader as well. Exams are hard with few questions (losing a lot of points). He is a little rude sometimes and straight-forward. Lots OF HW and quizzes and written HW as well. AVOID THIS CLASS.
Gary isn't all that bad. Physics is tough so no professor is going to baby you. My first professor for PHY121 was 10x less approachable and very condescending... and he is not, so I preferred him. You do have to read whats assigned or you will be entirely lost. Curved grades at the end of the semester. Lets you correct one exam problem for credit!
This professor expects you to teach yourself, class is just to go over what you "learned"
I honestly doubt he really has enough knowledge of physics. As a result, he is simply not capable of teaching. Being incapable is one thing, but not realizing it is even more horrible. Perhaps he should go to middle school or somewhere and teach some easy physics. College level is too hard for him.
Awful class. Unless you love physics and would like to spend an outrageous amount of time on a ridiculous 101 level class, avoid this professor. He loves trick q's on tests, no study guides avail. Not sure what is going on with lab TA's but they love yelling and gave calc level equations. There has to be a better way to do physics 101 than this.
Far and away the worst experience I've had in a class. There is no teaching, by design. The structure is, read the book, take a quiz, go over that quiz very briefly in class, do group practice problems. You are expected to teach yourself Physics. Scroll through the other reviews, everything negative they say is 100% accurate.
Took as non-major related class. Should have listened to bad ratings. Labs are frustrating (bad TA's year). NO TEST STUDY GUIDES, trick q's on exams! Lectures boring and are done on overhead, he is unapproachable/mocks students. TA's acknowledge math is physics 120 level. Far too challenging and irritating for 101 level. AVOID. Take at comm college
Physics is his life, literally. He has his own website that has everything you need on it. Lecture is twice a week and he is strict on grading. As long as you do all the homework and attend lecture you should be fine. It is a lot of information to keep up with you just have to stay very consistent with this class.
Clear notes, in-class experiments, well structured classes. The 2 problems in each exam are variants of the ones done in class. Drops the lowest exam plus curve. Had physics in high school but still had to study a lot! Teaches the right way, he isnt just going to give you a formula and call it a day. Labs, recitation and homework is a lot of work
Do not take this class unless you have previous experience in physics. Class average was a 61.16%, lectures are just him going over practice problems, can be condescending at times. There is a lot of homework which isnt really explained well in class. Recitations are basically pointless. If you dont already know physics then you wont pass
I read the previous comments about this teacher's classes and figured that I could tough this one out because I needed the class for my major. I am a hard worker and I tried my absolute best with this class but still got a B+. Take this professor if you are ready for hard work, otherwise I would take another professor.
I hope you've already taken physics in high school. Gary lectures A LOT of material each class, and breezes through it, so it's very fast paced. Tests are tough, but study your notes and homework assignments you'll score better (and by that I mean you'll get a B at best- these tests are tricky) Heavy curve at the end saved my life!
Gary Adams is by far the worst professor I've ever had. The TA for the recitations didn't teach us anything either. When asked a simple question Gary would just look at you and sometimes he would yell. He would be very frustrated before tests which would agitate the students. Never got higher than a D on the tests. Lectures are useless.
If you haven't taken physics before, don't expect anything higher than a C. Easily the most difficult class I've ever taken. Gary seems to know what he's doing but doesn't know how to teach his knowledge to his classes. Don't take this class if you can avoid it!
No lecture and homework is difficult. In class examples are useless. Don't take this class if you can.
Teacher name: Cavanaugh-Toft, Carolyn
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Such a good professor, tells lots of stories so its easy to connect the material to the stories when it comes time for exams. Exams are decently difficult but not horrible, just study.
Her class is honestly one of, if not the, best classes I've ever taken. As long as you reach the chapters and GO TO THE LECTURES and take notes, you'll easily pass with an A. She's hilarious and makes sure that the class is never boring. I always find myself listening and paying attention because her class is that engaging.
Dr C was really funny and her lectures are really easy to pay attention to. Her tests are kind of hard but nothing extreme. One hw per week
This was the best class I have ever taken, Dr. C is really amazing. She's an amazing prof, and she really cares. Her teaching style makes it super easy to learn the material and retain it. We did have an online textbook (FREE!) but I honestly read it one time and I still passed the class with an A.

We did have an online textbook (FREE!) but I honestly read it one time and I still passed the class with an A. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING THIS CLASS!
Dr C is a very engaging and friendly professor. She is clearly very knowledgeable. However, I found that her psych class was much more difficult than other psych 101s, meaning I did much more work than my other friends who had different professors. Lots of work but she makes it enjoyable. If you're looking for an easy A in Psych 101 this isn't it
I LOVED Dr. C! She is is very good at giving you the right information in an enjoyable way. She has amazing stories. Honestly take her even if you're not a psych major. The homework is just enough that it's not overwhelming
Dr. C is an amazing professor! Her lectures are captivating and fun. If you pay attention in class and keep up with readings, the tests are pretty easy (and she drops one of them). I would definitely recommend taking this course
Dr. Cavanaugh Toft is the best professor I have ever had. She is so reasonable, hilarious, and helpful. You can tell that she is an expert in her field. I looked forward to her class every day because she makes the content so interesting and fun. The way she teaches also makes it really easy to remember the information. Take her classes!!!!!
Dr C is awesome! I really liked her Abnormal Psych class. She doesn't post her lectures, so going to class is a must, but the time goes by quickly. She shares a lot of funny stories too which helps you remember the content. Your grade consists of exams and 10 easy assignments (lowest one is dropped).
Dr. C is by far the best prof I have ever had, in both the psych department and in SOLS. She cares about students, truly. She wants us to succeed. Her lectures are not mandatory, however, she does not post the lecture slides and will include questions from material only mentioned in class BUT Go to class- its entertaining and educational.
I loved Dr. C's class! She puts thought and effort into her lectures, and she will answer questions to make sure concepts are as clear as possible. She regularly schedules office hours with herself and TA's so students have plenty of opportunity to ask questions if needed. She tends to have a story for everything, they always apply to the lecture.
She is a really awesome professor! The textbook provided with the class is for free, and you only need to purchase a $5.00 app for attendance. There is a lot of material to learn, but she has review sessions and study guides to help out. She also offers a lot of opportunities to gain extra credit. If you work hard, you should get an A.
Wow! She is one amazing professor. If you show up to class you'll get 15 extra credit points. She's offers a free online textbook. Attendance is MANDATORY. No laptops or technology allowed during class. Four tests, lowest test score is dropped.12 easy assignments, tons of outside resources available. Really easy tests!
Dr. C is amazing! Her lectures are so funny and so memorable! She gives skeleton notes so you dont have to hastily write down everything from the lecture. She gives study guides before each test that really REALLY! the textbook is online and free so thats a positive! If you don't go to class though you will have a tough time.
She is very funny! But if you dont go to class you will not pass this class! She is a tough grader but you will not get a lot of homework. Get ready to read the online text book. She also gives a lot of extra credit out. No group projects ever. Her grading is not very clear but you can figure it out. Doesnt give much feedback.
Really great, fun, and engaging lectures. I always look forward to going to this class. Read the online textbook and take good notes to pass, the tests are very straight-forward and there are always opportunities to get help during office hours. Wouldn't take PSY101 with any other instructor.
Dr. C is a fantastic professor! Her lectures are really engaging, and the class is enjoyable. The tests are multiple choice, BUT the content can be tricky sometimes. Overall, you really do have to read the online text book and study in order to get the grade you want. I highly recommend taking this class with her!
By far she has been my favorite professor. The class and assignments are all fairly easy, but the tests... not so much. On the bright side, she drops your lowest exam grade at the end of the semester. She has AMAZING lectures that are hard to find boring. She really engages you in the class and makes things easy to understand. Just study for tests!
She is awesome! So funny and you can tell she's really passionate about the subject. Makes the class super interesting, I never want to miss class. She plays a fun song before every class. Very encouraging. She likes to put jokes in the exams. Quizzes are not regular, if we have one it's once in a blue moon and online.

Amazing professor, amazing lectures. Take this class, you wont regret it!
Eddie is one of the best professors at ASU. He actually cares about you learning the material and not just memorizing the readings. He sets you up to pass the class completely! All you have to do is read the Modules so make sure you buy them!Take it from someone who is in another SCM class this semester with a different professor who is horrible.
His lectures are astounding. He's very pragmatic, funny, &amp; no-nonsense, his lectures make you laugh but also make you think differently. He knows not everyone's a supply chain major &amp; makes the class interesting &amp; educational for all. Go to class, do the 4 quizzes, &amp; study for the exams, he makes it all as easy as possible
The class is very structured and you learn a lot of information. The tests can be a little difficult. Labs and quizzes are easy. Study really hard for the exams, get A+ on the quizzes and labs as you should, and go to class.
Entertaining lectures, accessible during his plentiful office hours. Eye-opening class. I took the online lab and loved it (unlimited attempts and practice video walks you through it). 6 Quizzes (only need to take 5, unlimited attempts), 6 labs (only need 5), and 3 non cumulative tests (do the study guides and skim the textbook)
This professor makes supply chain bearable and understandable to honestly anyone, and the required labs really help you understand the material better along with prepping for the exam - TAKE THE IN PERSON LABS. Attendance not required, but you are going to want to go to class - tests on lecture examples. Overall an average class, a lot of material.
I loved his sarcastic attitude on ideas, it's actually different and refreshing. Exams can be tough, but fill out the study guides, and you will manage. Take good notes in class, as many questions are based on in class examples. Math is relatively easy in supply chain. If you study, you can get an A pretty easily. Lectures are great, go to class!
This should be an easy A if you go to class, read the notes, and study. The exams are basically an in depth version of the vocabulary. Literally I do not see how you can fail this class. Fill out the study guide and you'll be fine.
I don't understand what's wrong with the comments, maybe Deavila comments himself every day. The exams are really hard and the professor is not nice. All ASU dishonest rules are mentioned by him at first, the RPNow and Online Study system were created by him, he does not believe any person in his life. He was teaching as senior instructor over15y
I took SCM300 with another professor but the class was very heavily based on Davila's video lectures. All the lectures were interesting and easy to understand. Even without taking his class I would recommend him. He explains complex topics so well and makes supply chain easy.
The only professor who doesn't care in the most sincere way. His lectures are made so anyone can understand supply chain. Recommend filling out the weekly study guide before/during class. Exams are an easy A if you know everything on this short list. Take the online labs.
He'll make you very interested in Supply Chain Management. Love the structure and content as well as his lectures, very well put together! Make sure you study.
Take this class!!!!!
Do yourself a favor and take this class as soon as you possibly can because it may just make you change your major to SCM.
Eddie is a good instructor, much better than I'd expected. His video lectures are excellent and explain the concepts clearly. He allows you to use notes and the module guides for the exams, and frankly, I believe I would've done poorly on the exams if it weren't for the notes and module guides. I recommend him.
Pay attention to lectures and take extremely detailed notes, you'll def need them for tests.
I honestly don't understand why the comments below say his exams are easy. I exerted so much effort studying, creating module guides, and watching videos and every time I took the exam I would do below average. His lectures are too long and I feel he could minimize them. He seems like a nice person, but as a prof he has impossible expectations.
I enjoyed SCM300 and feel like I learned a lot from the lectures. You get what you put into the course, but getting a C is achievable and not difficult. A lot of the test questions come from in class lectures. Take the online lab, not difficult and quick to fill out. Just go to class and somewhat listen to pass.
He's just funny in a cynical way. Would definitely take his class again. He pretends to hate everyone, but really he hates groups of people, not individuals. If you go visit him during his office hours, he'll be super helpful and caring.
Pretty terrible. Eddie makes the class harder than it should be for non-scm majors. I did fine in the class with a B but wasn't a fan of his arrogant attitude and over the top opinions about school and life. Davila cracks a few jokes that give a slight chuckle but hes a pretty mean dude. Try taking it online or with someone else.

Teacher comments: 
Honestly, this class is fairly easy and full of interesting content. There is a decent amount of homework to do, but listening to the lectures is actually very entertaining. I love the Beatles and learning about and hearing songs preformed by John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Did not care for the professor. Does not care about his student's success.
If you do the work you will pass. I was able to finish the portions of the course the day the sections were open (opens 1st half then 2nd later). Especially easy if you have prior knowledge of the music group. I will be taking the Elvis course next semester. Highly recommend!
Shellans was great! You can really tell he is passionate which makes his lectures enticing. There's a lot so be ready to pay attention, but it is very focused on what who is playing or who wrote it. You don't need the book but it does help with test questions. He opens up half the course so you can really tbh do it in the weekend!
This class is super easy, if you use your "resources." I did not buy the book and easily got an A still, even though it was a month long class. Assignments take 5 minutes, there's 3-4 tests NOT on Respondus Lockdown, and 2 discussion boards. Take this class as an elective!
There are 10+ hours of lecture per exam times 4 exams. If you take detailed notes throughout, it takes twice as long to get through. Exam questions come from the most minute details that he mumbles through in the lectures. Read other reviews, they say cheating is only way this class is easy. Doing the actual work takes hours upon hours.
Beatles class was too cool. get a Course Hero Account and you'll pass without having to read the book. you can watch the lectures and it will def help. Class was super interesting I've found a new love for the Beatles. he unlocks half the class day one and the other half 2-3 weeks in. I finished both in two days about 3 hours each day.
I took the "Elvis" class this semester, easy A! There are two DB posts, four exams, and a couple of homework assignments throughout the semester. Get a course hero account in order to help you out. Make sure to use "chrome" when taking this online course. There are recordings used as questions that won't work on Safari.
I took the class on Elvis and it was super interesting and very easy. Nice glass to use as an elective and GPA booster.
If you love the Beatles and want an easy A take this class. It's all pretty straight forward and easy.
The class was a pain. Take the class if you dont have a huge workload in your other classes. The tests are taken right from the lecture but the lectures add up to hours upon hours.
Only take this class if you get a course hero account. I didn't hate it or anything, but the professor was pretty ridiculous on the tests. I would listen to all his lectures (adding up to be hours) and then go to take the test and most of the questions would be on tiny details he briefly mentioned throughout the lecture.
I took the MUS354 Elvis class that counted as elective credit and as long as you have a Coursehero account, you will ace this class no problem. This class was very easy and also very interesting. There are 4 tests on the 4 chapters covered, 2 easy discussion board posts, and 3 mini quizzes per chapter. All answers for quizzes and exams are online!
This class was very easy. I was able to finish it in just 2 days (Half the class is open on the first day, the rest after a few weeks). Answers can be found online and I had a relatively fun time learning about the Beatles by doing this.
Took this for an UD credit and was well worth it. Audio lectures take some time due to having to pause often to type notes but isn't hard to dedicate time to it. Take good notes because the smallest detail could be on the exam. There is always course hero too. I already finished the course and it doesn't end until Oct.
Everyone says this class is so easy and can finish it in 2 days. NOT TRUE. Lectures are recorded and very heavy. The teacher speaks too fast and mumbles so you are not able to catch all of his notes. Tests heavy on super detail questions. I am a bio major and would never take this class again as answers online on course hero are NOT always right.
Flat out it's an easy A. That aside, I really enjoyed the subject matter (I took Women Who Rock) and learned a lot more than I originally knew. Great class and great professor.
don't waste your money on the books. was a fun class. not hard at all.
This was for sure the most simple class I have ever taken. I got all of the answers online and finished the course in only two days (he only opens half the course up at first). I used Shazam for the sound bite questions and did all of the assignments on time and ended with an A. Was not time consuming at all, I almost forgot I even had this class.
Took the women who rock class and it was extremely easy- if you know how to use google you will get an A. Finished the first and second half of the class in less than an hour each.
MUS 354: Women Who Rock was my favorite out of the three MUS 354 classes I have completed so far. I would say this is the most enjoyable and easy MUS 354 class I have taken... Elvis and Beatles after Beatles weren't difficult, but I enjoyed the content in this class a lot more. All of the exam answers are common knowledge or Google-able!
Teacher name: Roberts, Nancy

Teacher comments: 
This class on its own is very difficult, but Roberts seemed to try and make everything even more difficult. She provides no study guides and only an online review the day before the test at 8 am. We weren't allowed to use calculators on tests that included very difficult math. A ton of homework with little to or no explanation.
Very interesting class regarding business planning and communications. I highly recommend this professor and this class.
First off, ya'll complain too much. This class is pretty difficult but if you put in the effort it's really not that hard. She tells you MULTIPLE times if you need help go to her tutors. Go to her specific tutors, the others will be of very little help. You will learn a lot about economics and it's actually easy once you apply yourself.
Nancy Roberts, WORST PROFESSOR EVER. I took it ECN 212 as a Hybrid and this was no joke. Get ready for weekly quizzes, homework assignment due every two weeks through blackboard with only 1 attempt(also trick questions), and tests completely comprised of trick questions. YOU WILL be in the tutoring lab 24/7 for reviews in this impossible class.
Took her class only because i needed the credit. However her whole system was very confusing, and her videos were okay. She never really went over what would be in the HW or tests. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
Do not recommend this professor. Everything is in class, so basically if you miss one class you are screwed. The Study buddy people sorta helped but still ended up failing the exam.
She's entertaining, but the lectures were confusing, the homework even more so, and the tests are harder than both of them. This was my first C ever in a class. The review sessions were over 400 students crammed in a room with a really quiet TA with a heavy accent. Useless. The only test I did well on was the one where the professor led the review.
Super hard class and so many people withdraw from it. Would avoid taking her class.
Ms. Roberts was great. She inspired me to major in Economics.
I don't have any personal hatred/dislike for Nancy. I considered an economics minor until this class. I got &lt;50% on 2 tests. Her homework made no sense. What she lectured on did not relate to test/HW material. And her "buddies" tutors acted like I was an idiot when I came in and asked for help, I never went back. Avoid her and the class at all cost
DO NOT TAKE HER! Her course is nothing like other micro courses. I went to 6 tutors and none of them understood what she was doing. She has her own tutoring center called "buddies" but even one of the buddies didn't know how to help. The notes she takes down in class are sporadic and unclear. Many people withdraw from her course.
One of the worst professors I have had at ASU. She is boring, not clear and her tests are hell. The class is only based on tests and a couple homework assignments. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Did not round my grade by one point which gave me a D
Amazing teacher who is dedicated to her students, very educational class that tells you more and more about situations going on in the world that affect you. She has a very high knowledge on microeconomics and is very caring towards her students. She will definitely go the extra mile to help out her students with their class.
Dr. Roberts is an amazing professor. She communicates very clearly when speaking, and even though she doesn't use Powerpoint she always draws out visuals to help you understand. But I won't lie, her tests are hard. I'm not great at econ or math in general, but use all the resources she offers and you can do it. The tutorial videos are the best.
If you have an actual interest in econ, then take her. If you're just taking the class to fulfill a requirement for a different major, then I wouldn't. She doesn't use slides so you need to take really good notes. Memorization won't help, you need to actually understand the concepts. Sometimes she gives extra credit in class, so show up.
Roberts is the worse professor I have ever had! Her idea of lecturing is not using powerpoints but rather writing random graphs and equations on a legal pad and not explaining what they are. Homework is confusing and you only get one attempt. Currently using my econ notes from HIGH SCHOOL to get me through the class. Avoid at all costs.
If you are an econ major, 100% take Dr. Roberts, if not, steer clear. Dr. Robert's lectures are all done using pen and paper and are not posted anywhere so if you want the notes you have to go to class and pay attention. Tests and homework are hard but she ensures you learn the material. Don't skip out on the Econ Buddies, they are awesome.
If you have other options, please choose those. However if this class is your only option, go to tutoring and watch the tutorials she posts on blackboard. As the semester went on, her content of her lectures had nothing to do about the content of the exams.
I LOVE Nancy as a person, however, I know that I started the year with 5 friends in this class and now I am the only one left. If you are looking for an easy microecon class this is not the professor for you. If you are willing to work for it, you will pass.
I love this woman. Professor Roberts is an amazing teacher and walks you through everything you need to know for her homework and tests. With that being said, attending class is mandatory, as she provides most answers in class. Tests can be tough, but as long as you utilize all of the resources she provides, getting an A won't be too difficult.
Teacher name: Mae, Lynda

Teacher comments: 
I took this class online. The online lectures are ok and the professor seems nice. The problem with this class is that it is extremely unorganized. You can barely get in touch with the professor or the TAs, you can't e-mail them directly, they don't answer the phone during office hours. Exams are extremely hard and they don't even offer extra cred.
Take this professor she is great. I missed an A by three points and she allowed me to re due a lab to get the remaining points. There are no plus or minus in the course, so if you dont get an A (4.00) you get a B (3.00). she has great lectures online that are concise and she also gives lecture power-poin for you to fill in as well as a study guide
Sleeping and Dreaming, includes 4 exams and 6 short labs. No discussion boards or papers. Take good notes on the lectures and study well because you cannot use notes during the exams. I found her lectures to be easy to follow and she is very clear on what will be on the exams. The textbooks are pocket size, inexpensive, and mandatory.
I actually love this class! It's a hybrid so you only have to go in on Tuesdays! I know people in other psych classes and their exam averages were D's, but our class average was a B. The module readings take a while but she tells you exact questions that are going to be on the test! She gives interesting lectures and makes everything easier!
Fast track online course, perhaps my fault. Called Sleeping and Dreaming. Prepare to learn 3 full chapters in two weeks, memorize all info. Learn the brain inside and out. Lockdown browser and Webcam monitor so no notes on tests. All just videos of her lecturing, some easy labs, and a test for every unit. Don't take if you have a heavy class load.
One of the easiest classes you could take at ASU. Exams are all very straight forward and all questions are either from class content, concept check quizzes (on learning path), and test your learning slides (which you do in class but are available online for studying). make sure to do Sona Research early and get extra credit.
Very strange teaching style, graded almost entirely on tests, and long lecture videos (about 1-2 hours per week). 3 Exams and 1 Final make up 2/3 of the class, along with a midterm assignment and 5 labs (which are insanely easy). Material was simple if you know basic psychological principles, but for whatever reason I still didn't enjoy this class
Modules are so long and boring but not really worth to read since the exams are only based on the quizzes in it. Exams are pretty hard bc it covers such a wide range of information and has tiny details. She's sweet but the lectures were boring. Only have class on Tuesdays! Offers extra credit on 2 things (attendance and SONA credits)
Dr. Mae is really an interesting professor, a little quirky, but has amazing lectures. If you are not prepared to read and gain a lot of information, do not take this class. However, if you are interested to learn a lot about psychology she is a great professor.
I dont enjoy hybrid classes so that was one reason why I didnt like this class. Also she was very bland in lectures and you arent always sure what you're doing. I am a nursing major and this class im struggling the most in because of the way it is taught. Would not take again with this prof.
Took the accelerated online course. Changed textbooks 3 times in the first 3 days of the course putting students approx $150 in the hole before we were given correct textbook information. Resulting in stress and a week of lost class time. Lecture heavy. Exams test more on memorizing names as opposed to understanding of over all material.
Dr. Mae is a knowledgeable women who clearly has a passion for Psychology, but unfortunately her exam's are TERRIBLE and NOT fair. I'm a Junior in college and I've taken plenty of exams. Hers are by far the WORST. They're all online and once you choose an answer you CANNOT go back. If you accidently click C... too bad. Overall, STAY AWAY!!
This class is mostly graded by 4 online exams (that are very fair). There are 5 labs that are easy and one midterm assignment that Is not difficult to complete, but is quite subjective for an exam style assignment. Lectures are not long and super interesting, but video quality blows. A is not difficult to obtain and you will enjoy the class overall
I took her online PSY 350 course and it was way better than I expected. You have 4 exams including the final that are majority of your grade. Homeworks are 5 question labs. You also have one midterm concept assignment. Overall, wonderful teacher and easy lectures. Take this course online!
Tests are exactly what is on the lectures, as long as you study the study guide- you will be fine. About 3 extra credit assignments offered for like 5 points, but they help so much!
Note outlines are a big help, but Mae rambles during lectures and glosses over at least one thing on each slide. Online IN CLASS tests are a nuisance. What kind of test doesn't let you check your work or move onto easier questions?? Would've preferred a paper test. Tested on a lot of trivial material, including class demos and statistics.
Just need to take 4 quizzes in class to pass, all the information is in the lectures but she doesn't go into very much detail.
lectures are not helpful and I went to the Ta's office hours all the time. She has a very hard time making her points clear. DO NOT TAKE
Good professor (not amazing but good) and very reasonable. Lots of material to cover and can seem overwhelming. Quiz-let will be your best friend. Lots of extra credit to get and DO YOUR RESEARCH CREDITS EARlY.
(For Consumer Psych) Incredibly easy class. Everything on the test is on the study guide-- no surprises. Interesting class, would be nice if it was more challenging. I found the book far more substantive than the lectures.
Teacher name: Washo-Krupps, Delon
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
The harder part of bio201 was LAB for me. It's a lot of information so don't fall behind. Take pictures of clicker questions because they are often test questions (aka show up to lectures). She gives you a lot of "filler points" like DB and syllabus quiz and connect assignments so the grade is basically tests and lab so make study groups!
Dr. Washo-Krupps casual style belies her in-depth familiarity with anatomy &amp; physiology. Shes very approachable, has a sense of humor, monitors the msg. board and responds quickly. After many hours of lectures, I appreciate her delivery without ums and uhs. BIO201 is way heavy on homework - forget about an A. Don't drag your GPA down.
Dr. Washo-Krupps is organized, her course schedule is easy to follow, and the course blackboard page was easy to navigate. She was very responsive via email and on the Discussion Board. This is is a hard class, be sure to do all of the extra credit. If you want an A, be ready to spend 30-40 hours per week on coursework. It's a lot of work.
Dr. Krupps is really knowledgeable but the way she teaches A&amp;P gets very boring very fast since he can easily spend several minutes on one powerpoint slide. Homework is online and EXTREMELY time consuming, so start early. Her exams are straightforward if you know the material, but can be really challenging if you don't put the study time in.
Prof Krupps is absolutely a great anatomy teacher. She knows her materials really well but she has a really bad teaching style which means she expect you to RECITE everything you have in the powerpoint. She is not a bad professor she answers when you ask but does not explain. You can basically find every answer from the ppt. NEED LOTS OF EFFORTS.
Dr. Washo-Krupps is a great anatomy professor and very knowledgable. The lecture exam were difficult but if you studied you were fine. She offers some extra credit and has many interesting lectures and tries to tie diseases and viruses into the material for pre-med students. She is willing to answer your questions and will help. Great Professor.
Pretty much everything for this class is done outside of the class. You have to watch videos of the lecture before you attend lecture, which is pretty much mandatory because there are clicker quizzes every day. Clicker questions are repeated on exams which is nice. Uses CONNECT for homework and each assignment has 150+ questions.
Dr. Washo-Krupps is highly knowledgeable and leaves no stone unturned with Anatomy &amp; Physiology. You WILL work hard in this class, probably harder than in most classes, but to ace the course is doable. Absorb the slides; the exams are derived from them. Clicker questions also reappear on tests. If you put in honest, daily work, it will pay off.
Dr. Washo-Krupps has a flipped classroom style, meaning she supplies (extremely useful) lecture videos and uses the class time to go over clicker questions and review important topics. Read through the powerpoints, watch the videos, and review clicker questions to be successful. BIO202 is tough, but she makes it enjoyable and rewarding!
Real talk, this bio class takes up A LOT of your time, but it's definitely doable! Get all the points you can from homework and labs (attempts are unlimited). Also do the extra credit which is a pain but helpful. As for the exams, it may take 3-4 days to grasp the material. I suggest using 1 day to finish all the homework and the rest to study.
The class and lab should be split into 2 courses because that is how much work you have to do. This class has a ton of info and WILL be the class you think about throughout your semester, but if medicine is the route you want to take then I would highly recommend, she is accessible outside of class and gives good feedback. She will test you.
Dr. WK is an amazing professor, especially for such a hard class. I took both BIO 201 and 202 in one summer and the workload was crazy but Dr. WK made it interesting and doable. Her lectures were incredibly useful, but the textbook was still necessary. Very interesting and comprehensive, but work intensive!
MANY assignments due weekly &amp; only worth very little. Exams worth a lot w an exam due weekly on average. Wants you to know close to 150 terms per exam with not enough time to study them AND wants you to know details from the readings rather than big picture concepts. Instructor is knowledgeable but the online course/points are structured horriblyyy
Too many assignments due weekly (10-12 average). Some were really time consuming (2hrs avg) and only worth 10pts, while exams were worth between 75-100. The way the points were structured left really little room for error. There are other instructors w different grading criteria that won't make you feel like you're falling behind &amp; drowning in work
Pro 1. Teacher always has quick response to questions Con 1. minimum of 13 assignments due per week sometimes 2 exams 2. assignments have 50 -200 questions worth low point value 4-10 points 3. Strict proctored exams no time to learn material 4. does not focus on "big picture" concepts, tests on small details, so expected to EVERYTHING!
Very challenging course, especially since it is compressed into 6 weeks. Be prepared for a ton of assignments/lectures. It was a 1000 point class, 500 of it from exams and quizzes. There is room for error, just don't fall behind. I learned a lot, but had to put a lot of time and effort into keeping up. She always responded first to questions.
Great professor. She explains things very clearly. 202 is given in an active learning style. Watch the videos ahead of time and you will make your life a lot easier. Come to class for clicker points. She's very clear about what is expected. Watch the lectures, study an average amount and you can get an A no program.
Summer 6 weeks course. Challenging class. But its a lot of material to cover. I failed every single exam but with all the homework and extra credit I finished with a B. Teacher prepares powerpoints and notes, grades really fast. I think she did great as a professor honestly just get ready to learn. You need to know this stuff regardless
Soooo much work. I understand it is a summer class and everything is packed together but this was way too much. There is so much busy work that is not really needed and it distracts you away from preparing for the exams. Literally, you only have like a day or so to study 100+ terms if you stay on track with everything. Do not take this class!!!!
I took this class in the summer. I understand that because it is in summer it will be harder, that doesn't mean the prof has to be so uncaring. I got a 0 on an exam, I was flagged for not starring at the screen for the WHOLE 2 hours. After I explained my situation and offered to send in Dr notes, I STILL GOT A 0. Worst experience w an online class.
Teacher name: Kefeli-Clay, Agnes
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Great instructor. She does have a strong accent in the lecture videos, but you are still able to understand her. A lot of quizzes but they are simple. Many extra credit opportunities!
If you dont show up, youll miss a lot. Textbooks is good for remembering but dont rely on it
I'll be honest: I had her for her REL 100 class, and only took this class because I thought she would be an easy grader and offer extra credit like her other class. But she makes you work for that grade! An interesting class, with interesting discussions. If you put the effort in, getting an A is not an issue. Amazing class!
Kefeli is a good professor, albeit it might seem like a lot of hard work for a level 100 class. Stay on top of your assignments, attend classes regularly, and invest into a clicker. I passed her class with over 100% because of how much extra credit she gave out. It may seem daunting or intimidating at first, but you adjust in time. Don't slack off!
She has a pretty thick accent but you will get used to it. Lots of extra credit opportunities, the clicker points in class are EC, last couple of questions on the test are extra credit. There is a study guide for the test which are semi helpful. The review sessions are helpful. 4 Test, which are pretty difficult but doable. Lots of online quizzes.
She's interesting and passionate about the subject, but I don't think she respects her students very much since we had to spend around $250 for her class alone. It's very easy to get an A if you do all the homework and go to class. You honestly don't even need to pay attention in class if you listen to the people around you or check the book.
You have to buy the book for the class, which sucks, but she doesn't deserve the low rating. She's got a thick accent, but her class is ridiculously easy if you show up to class. I earned over 100 points of extra credit from the clicker exercises, and if you go to the review sessions or just read the lectures she posts, there's no reason to fail
I ended her class with 107 extra points because if you go to class she offers LOTS of extra credit opportunities. Her lectures are boring but nothing unmanageable. She gives you lots of time to complete online homework, which can be tedious but is very doable (multiple attempts on most of it). Shes a nice lady and her accent is easy to get used to
IF YOU LIKE BUSY WORK THIS IS THE PROFESSOR FOR YOU! SHE IS PASSIONATE AND SWEET HOWEVER LACKS AUTHENTICITY IN LECTURES AND DOES NOT MAKE SUBJECT INTERESTING. IF YOU ARE EFFORT ORIENTED THIS IS THE CLASS FOR YOU. THICK ACCENT MAKES IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND.
You should go to class because almost every class you have the chance for extra credit points. You receive a decent amount of homework but make a couple of friends in the class and do them together.
All you need to do to pass this course with an A is watch the videos and take semi-extensive notes. Theres more than enough extra credit opportunities to make up for missed questions. Anyone complaining is simply too lazy to bother with school in the first place. This is NOT a difficult course. It simply requires a lot of time investment.
This course, in a typical week, has multiple quizzes and an exam. There are many lectures and you MUST watch them and take notes in order to make good grades. Overall, the content is not difficult, but you will need to set aside numerous hours for quizzes and exams.
Dr. Kefeli's class was an interesting introductory course to world history, her assignment were never difficult. The tests were very easy to get perfect scores on if you stayed awake and came to class every day. She did a lot of review of the important things, offered extra credit and was very engaging. I really want to take a 300-400 lvl. with her
Easy A class, weekly assignments, tests easy enough if you know whats on the study guide, lots of chances to redeem yourself with extra credit clicker questions
She gives great lectures with insightful historical perspective. This class was the most interesting introductory course that I've ever taken.
She is a really good teacher and she is passionate about what she teaches. She has a student that takes her own time to tutor at night. However, for a pre req, the amount of money you spend on textbooks is ridiculous. One textbook is just her powerpoints on paper with crossword puzzles.. (required book and expensive!)
Dr. Kefeli gives very long, very dry lectures. But at the same time, you can tell she loves what she teaches and is very clear and specific about what she teaches you. As long as you show up to class and take the online quizzes, it's almost impossible not to pass. Get the clicker because she gives out a ridiculous amount of extra credit.
She gives very long lectures, but they can be pretty interesting at times. There is a lot of extra credit given through clicker questions. Attendance is mandatory, and she enforces it by collecting in class hw at random times. While the class itself is very boring, Dr. Kefeli is a great instructor and I would definitely take her class again.
She has an accent that you'll get used to after a couple weeks. SO MUCH EXTRA CREDIT! If you go to the lectures, she emphasizes certain points to hint they will be on the exam. The exams are long and the questions are specific, but there's so much extra credit in the class that everything will balance out. If you have an work ethic, you'll get an A
Her lectures are very long and can get boring but she tries to make them as lively as possible. She gives a lot of homework but for the most part, it is simple. She does extra credit. Very fun and knows a lot about what she teaches.
Teacher name: Hendrickson, Kirstin
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Do NOT sign up for her online classes if you work full time. It's impossible to keep up and she is not forgiving or lenient in the slightest
Professor clearly has no experience teaching online classes. She specificalpy designed the class to be completed during the hours of a typical work week which makes no sense. Texbook is required and a hassle to access. Grading is vague and sloppy. Prof is difficult to reach, doesn't care about technical difficulties. Unrealistic work load.
Hendrickson is a good choice for chm 113. If you go to lectures and do the work, you will be fine. She has homework assignments for each chapter which are fairly easy, especially since it's graded for completion. Her exam questions are mostly reflected from the homework, practice exams, &amp; optional quizzes. She is passionate about what she teaches.
She loves to hear herself talk and is known to give personal tutoring sessions after hours if you know what I mean.
Dr. Hendrickson is a really awesome professor. She moves really fast in her lectures, but the course material is not too difficult. Doesn't require clickers or mastering chemistry assignments, but she does have chapter worksheets graded on completion. Extra credit on exams &amp; a resurrection final to take the place of your worst out of 3-4 tests.
If you haven't taken chemistry before I suggest you take it with a different professor. Hendrickson goes through topics very fast and there aren't a lot of material to help you with the exams.
She goes over things quite fast, it is very hard to keep up with her at times. She's an interesting and funny person but a confusing and not thorough professor.
Loved the class, she kept the concepts accessible and explained everything wonderfully. She's very accessible outside of class and her office hours are great! She even helped me get a tutoring job! Labs and recitation are fairly easy as well. She really cares about the class.
She's really great. CHM113 online was kind of tossed on her lap at the last minute and so it was a bit scattered, but I thought she did well considering. Really Cool Science is awesome. Best part of the class.
I've taken AP chem, but I've never really understood chem until I took this class. Compared to the other profs teaching CHM113, she is by far the easiest with the least amount of work. Lectures are fast-paced and disorganized, but she knows what she's talking about and applies it to the real world. Look at practice tests and book problems for tests
Her lectures can be a bit disorganized and she goes on tangents a lot. Be prepared to do extra reading and book problems at home. You won't get by on lectures and homework alone. You aren't allowed to take pictures of example problems during class and they're not in the notes, so make sure you write them down during class. Pretty average class
Hendrickson is great! For all the people who say she speaks too fast, that is true, her pace is a little quick at times, but her power points for lectures are always posted online and she offers multiple resources if you're still confused. It's a lecture class; her job is not to hold every student's hand and walk them through the material.
Tests very difficult, homework doesn't give practice for them. Recitation/lab DO NOT align with class so if you arent great at chem you will struggle to keep up with all 3. Talks fast, notes dont give you all material. Book phrases things different than she does. Only take if you are a natural at chem and enjoy great challenges. Nice lady though.
Dr. Hendrickson is an amazing professor. You can tell that she really cares about the subject she is teaching and wants students to succeed in her class. There is very little required homework but she provides a lot of extra resources (book problems, quizzes, practice tests, note sheets) on blackboard in case you don't understand something.
Terrible .She doesn't explain any thing she is teaching. Moves at a fast pace.
Her lectures make you want to pay attention. Shes super funny too. One homework assignment per chapter; past exams and answers posted in blackboard; MUST ATTEND HER LECTURES OR NOTHING WILL MAKE SENSE. She moves pretty fast but doesnt skip over important material. Overall, phenomenal teacher, but the class still required lots of studying for me.
If you want to take CHM394 in Summer, my recommendation is this class should be your only one class due to the work load. Generally, she is fair and hilarious. You can get easy points in discussion section but be careful with the Case Studies. Don't make up scientific facts, she can detect them.
She's a great professor. All of her example problems relate to EXACTLY what's on the exam. She warns you about what sections require more studying, and the only downfall of the class is the complete lack of attendance requirements and mandatory hmwk. No MasteringChem, but study on your own. I could have gotten an A, but I didn't study enough
While she is a very tedious professor, you can tell that she definitely cares about her material and her students. Only having 2-3 days to do class work and quizzes is kinda difficult. I chose to go to online school because I work full time, and it was very difficult to balance this class with my work.
Dr. Hendrickson was awesome! Lectures were really interesting, as was the homework. Class was based on a few reading assignments, and 5 case studies (4 of which are papers and one is creating your own science experiment to do with kids). All in all, probably my favorite and most worthwhile class I have taken at ASU! Take this class!
Teacher name: Zhu, Anmin
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
If something goes off the code, itll be difficult to get him not to stick to the code no matter what. He teaches using examples only and doesnt answer questions very well, just kinda points at it some more. 5 exams make up 75% of the grade and there is no extra credit, you need to study hard to pass this class.
He is hands down my most favorite professor of college so far. His tests are almost identical to class examples and homework and any grade below a B on a test is only your fault. He is by far the most passionate math professor I've ever had. If you do not leave his class inspired, then you came to class to be disappointed.
Online class, lectures were generic for the school and not actually from Zhu. Quick to respond to questions however which was really nice. Final is 35% of your total grade so definitely heavy hitting. Tests followed homework pretty well but I still spent quite a bit of time in tutoring so be ready to put in the work because its college not HS!
His class is undeniably hard, but if you pay attention in class, you still won't pass. If you haven't taken calculus before this, don't take his class. If you don't know algebra WELL, dont take his class. If you cant understand foreign accents, don't take his class. Overall very fun.
Zhu is clearly knowledgeable in math. However, if this is your first math class at ASU, I would advise against taking him. Background knowledge in calculus is essential to doing well in his class. He is extremely test heavy and tests you on hard examples, so understanding the material is vital to an A. You'll have to work for that A, or even B.
This professor clearly loves math, but has no idea how to teach it. You can't understand him and he does not take questions in class. Tale this class if you have taken AP calc and don't want to learn anything new but if you do not know calc before this class you will be screwed.
He is the funniest professors I have ever had. He really cares about the subject matter and knows what he is talking about. I laughed in every class I went to. Love him
HE DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH CLEARLY. You most likely wont under stand a single thing he says and will have to use the textbook to learn every single lesson. Dont bother showing up to class because he wont teach you anything anyway. Even stuff I already know, I was confused about through trying to understand his explanations. DO NOT TAKE this course.
Prof. Zhu is hands down the best math professor I've ever had. He invests his time in his students if you're willing to put in the work to pass. He is always available to answer questions via email or office hours. His lectures are long, fast paced and packed with info; but they will be the best lectures you have at ASU. A++ Professor
Fantastic math professor. Always starts the lecture jumping right in and made sure we were "with him".
He is a very hard teacher and will fail you if you do not try as hard as possible
Dr. Zhu is by far the most passionate math professor I have ever met. To him, math is a language, and he is sure to make you notice the beauty of it. You HAVE to attend class if you expect to pass tests, as many parts of the exams are graded based on the specific steps shown in class. This is a great class for one who has already seen the material.
Zhu is not for everyone, but he is an incredible math teacher who wants you to learn. He's funny and not boring. Tests make up a huge chunk of the grade, and if you don't pay attention or don't show up you will absolutely struggle. If you make an effort and show up, you should be fine. His tests are very similar to quizzes and class notes.
Very Hard Professor and half of my class was failing before the final. Not the worst professor out there but one of the hardest out there.
Amazing man. He is the most passionate Calculus professor I've ever had and conveys his excitement every day. Make sure to go to class because his in-class examples are similar to his test questions. If you pay attention and take close notes you're gonna get an A while also having a good time.
His accent is easy enough to understand, lectures contain a lot of useful information that shows up on tests so be sure to never miss a class. He offers extra credit on all tests if the average isn't a 70. Not lots of homework. Overall good professor that knows his stuff and cares about his students. As tough as to be expected from Calc 2.
I feel like Zhu could be a great professor, and if you're good at math, he probably is. But unfortunately his lectures sometimes lack focus, and he often assumes the class understands more than it actually does. If you take him, do not skip class. Almost every lecture has new, important information that directly correlates to problems on the tests.
I have always been really good at math and I am failing. He doesn't offer any partial credit on exams and you basically have to teach yourself all of the material. You have to sign an attendance sheet every day and there are pop quizzes every week. He has a 20% rule so they all get As, then next 20 gets Bs. All 266 profs are tough so good luck.
Avoid at ALL COSTS. Has NO regard for students. Has said, "If you have a full time job or take more than 2 classes, you should not take my class". For some reason, he believes his class is the most important one you will take, and it is not. Speeds through lectures, is a messy writer, and makes mistakes. DO NOT TAKE ZHU.
Teaches extremely fast and he has a slight accent. hard to follow. Gives weekly quizzes and attendance is mandatory. At the beginning on semester went on about how he wants everyone to succeed and how if the average was below a 70 on tests he would make everyone redo the tests yet on both tests the average was below and he curved only a few points.
Teacher name: Johnson, Julia
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
good
There is a lot of reading and even more drawing. The book is needed and will help a lot with the illustrations. Everything she you need to do is written in the syllabus and on canvas. It was a little boring for me but that's because the topics didn't interest me. Easy A if you put work into it.
Dr. Johnson and Reynolds was one of the finest professors I took first semester of college. For anyone with even a remotely passive interest in geology, the HW + concept sketch exams are a breeze (though they are admittedly time consuming). Attendance isn't necessary to pass, but you should go anyway because the lectures are incredibly interesting!
Professor Johnson is such a sweet person, but the structure of this class was not enjoyable for me at all. Every test is memorizing 12-25 pages out of the textbook word-for-word including diagrams. On the day of tests you get a blank sheet of paper and have to fill both sides with drawings and writing answering 2 out of the 25 concepts. VERY HARD
She was very energetic and always engaged with the class not a lot of homework was given out either.
I didnt actually have Johnson specifically, but I did have Mara, one of the TAs. She was super helpful and was always available to give you any pointers that you needed. If you actually come to class and work with your partners in the lab, this class should be an easy A. and thats coming from someone who is terrible at science.
I have taken upper level philosophy classes and they dont even come close to this lab! Seriously the hardest, most time consuming, thing ive ever done!! Im an jr in college, please take my advice and pick another lab if you need this for credit, or at least a different professor!!
Professor Johnson seems like a nice lady, but this course is crazy. It was way too much work for it to be a level 100 course. If you're just wanting to meet your science gen credit, STAY AWAY. If you want to be an expert in Geology, this one's for you!
I would go to WAR for Julia Johnson. Anyone that gave her a poor rating has never actually sat down with her. Shes easy to find outside of class, and she clearly cares so much about her students. Everything you need to do to pass is easy, just tedious, and if youre struggling, GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Shell make it easier w/o being condescending.
I had Julia as one of my professors so SES 121. She took the time to get to know all the students in out lecture and remembers me when I see her a year after I've taken her class. She really cares that students learn and gives you all the tools and information to get an A in her course. The amount of work is perfectly reasonable.
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH for a 100 level class. So disappointed
This is a 1 credit, 100 level class that requires anywhere from 7 to 10 assignments a week. Its insane! Awful class, dont take it! She takes a super easy course and forces entirely more assignments than necessary. This 1 credit course requires more work than all of my 400 level courses. What a waste of time and money.
If you know something about Geology I would take this class. Tests and homework clearly defined. Professor ALWAYS got back to me right away. I know nothing about rocks and will never use this class in my life. The class was a struggle for me. There was a lot of homework. If you are halfway decent or have time to study, professor is super nice
The actual class was not as hard as the lab. The class itself was a lot of work but I got an A. The lab, on the other, hand, is just silliness. Had to buy a lab manual, the book, and none of the information given was helpful. Try to avoid this class if possible, otherwise be prepared to find other helpful sources because this class is not helpful.
This was the worst class I have taken in my entire college career. Its a 100 level class so I don't understand why they tried to make it so incredibly hard. This class was harder than all of my 400 level finance courses and took 10x the amount of time. 100/10 do NOT recommend this class. Barely scraped by with guessing
Feedback was given on only two assignments the entire class, which, without counting was at least 40+. If you have a chance to take this lab in person do so, I hope I never have to take a lab online again.
From an honors student in engineering: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE. 101: TONS of reading and quizzes (extremely time consuming), 3 chapters due every 10 days, mind numbing. 103: 3 labs due every 10 days, very very time consuming!! Absolutely do not take lab online. They grade 10x easier in class vs online. This isn't a joke, don't take this class
GLG101 was a breeze, the actual GLG103 Lab was nearly impossible to do. The lab manual that you had to buy for $20 is mandatory and absolutely worthless in regards to information. You are expected to identify rocks based on the picture. Pinpoint and draw the exact locations on a map. You will end up buying chegg if you want to pass but not guarante
Geo101 was time consuming, but doable. Geo103, the lab, is incredibly impossible. The workload is heavy for 1 credit. The material provided were inefficient for the questions asked. Virtual Field Trip, multiple written assignments, Videos didnt always work &amp; Ive tried multiple computers. I never want to see Geology again. A in Geo101 C in Geo103
I took this class going of this rating on ratemyprofessor...I highly regret taking this class. Her overall 101 class is a lot of work; however, if you put the time in to skim through the book you can get an A in the class... The hardest part is easily the lab. The lab modules are so difficult and literally makes no sense. A in 101. C in 103 Lab.
Teacher name: Filer, John
School name: Arizona State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is a pretty good professor, even he always talked about the other than class information during the class.   However, he gave us a lot extra credits, if you attend every class, you will win those extra credits, it helps you pass the class easily! Part questions of the tests are similar with the homework.
tough
there is 120 extra credit just to subscribe to WS journal! if you can't pay 12 bucks for a newspaper you might as well not take the class. Attendance is not required but there is extra credit given also when not many people attend. the tests are hard but they are the same as the HWs which he answers prior to submitting the HWs on the same date.
I don't know what everyone is tripping about, this was honestly the easiest class. If you took any ecn in high school this class is cake. On the three tests I got 100%, 77%, and a C? I think? but ended up with a A+ in the class. Filer isn't that bad. Lectures are sometimes boring, sometimes interesting. The 3 hr session sucked. Gives extra credit!
Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT take Filer. The exams and homeworks are not covered by anything in his lectures, nor  the textbook, nor the lecture notes.  I originally regretted buying the WSJ for this piece of sht class, but he adds on 120pts of extra credit if you do. You wanna pass? Head to ECN tutoring.
This class is HARD. Lectures don't really cover anything that's on the exams... Be prepared to study the posted "Pizza" packets and make sure you READ THE BOOK. Participation in class results in bonus points. While it is difficult, it is possible to get an A, you just have to put in the work.  Not recommended for those who don't like to read.
It's 90% concept based, very little memorization. Didn't buy the book, never used the WSJ, stopped taking notes after day 2; finished the class with a 101%. Only 13 of students attended class: that's a mistake. I went to lectures, spent about 10 hours total on the 4 HW assignments, and never studied. Didn't have to take the final; easiest A+ ever.
Hands down the worst professor I've ever had, and I'm working on a second Bachelor's so I've had a few.  I've never felt the need to go on this website until I took his class.  He talks down to his students and often strays so far off topic that he loses his audience. DON'T BUY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and you can't sell the book either.
The tests in this class are very tough, but they are based almost completely on the homework. You must attend class to pass. My advice: Get a study buddy that's in the class and truly master the content in order to pass the tests. He throws out one test grade out of four.
please read the reviews. i actually did, but still took the class and it was a big mistake. im usually an A and B student, and i really worked for this one. It not that the material is super hard, its just that he talks about it broadly and doesnt give you the tools to help you understand it. Dont buy book or WSJ. had to use lots of outside sources
Very difficult class. His posted lecture notes are essays that hes written ages ago. Lectures are difficult to follow due to him rambling on about obscure things. Doesn't use PowerPoint or very many visual aids. I don't recommend him for a professor at all and wish I would have picked someone else.
While many do not like his teaching style, I believe those are the people that don't pay attention or are on their computers during class. If you go to class, listen to his lectures, study for his tests, and just generally care about the class, you will do just fine. I really enjoyed this class, it just takes a little effort to succeed.
I really wanted to like this class. Filer was clearly very emotionally-invested in the material, but the lectures are completely unrelated to the homework and exams and he even acknowledges his own poor teaching methods and excuses them.   I don't recommend this class. But if you do take it, you don't need the bookApliaWSJ subscription.
Personally, Dr. Filer is the worst professor I've ever had. His lectures are impossible to sit through; he rambles and the content is irrelevant. He doesn't prepare you well for the exams at all. I learned more from the tutors than I ever did in class. Studied for hours and still didn't do well on the exams. I would not recommend Filer.
I liked Filer as a person and I think he is very knowledgeable, but he just simply can't teach. His lectures are kinda scattered, he gives random weird examples that make no sense, and it is just so darn hard to stay awake during the lectures. He does curve, and gives out homework answers, but you basically have to teach the whole class to urself.
I'm an exchange Italian student and Filer is the BEST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD. He may look hostile at first, but is completely the opposite. FRIENDLY, HELPFUL AND TOTALLY COMPREHENSIVE when it comes to know him personally. He knows A LOT, makes real life based examples and tries his best to keep lectures interesting by involving students. RECOMMEND
I am an Italian exchange student and Filer is the BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD. He may appear hostile, BUT HE'S COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE. HELPFUL, FRIENDLY, TOTALLY COMPREHENSIVE. He knows a lot of things and he's very clear in his lectures. He also tries his best to keep them interesting and make real life examples.
The material is a bit confusing and the test are still tough even after going to all the classes. The teacher does seem to really care about the material, but he often rambles a lot. I would not recommend this class.
Personally, my worst teacher. Lectures dull with little to no relevant material that will help you on tests, much less with comprehending economics. Doesn't teach and even acknowledges it. I had to resort to help from peers to pass. Doesn't invest in his students and demands respect that isn't deserved, or given based on the lack of attendance.
Overall, he is a very discouraging professor. There were many times where I was tempted to walk out of class during lecture.
Teacher name: Malan, David

Teacher comments: 
Good explanations. CS50 as a course could have been structured better.
Extremely good professor at Harvard, one of the best. Learned all about what an interger was etc.. addition multiplication and even subtraction. You really have to study and have a love for cs.
Professor Malan gives the best lectures I have experienced.
The best professor I have seen in my life, always well prepared with lectures well thought through. Makes the course material accessible and interesting. Highly recommended!
Amazing lectures and explanation skills.
The best professor I've ever heard, would definitely like to take his other courses. David is so inspiring!
I am among those "less comfortable" with CS and if you're like me, you'll love this professor because of his way of teaching - he can make everything understandable. If you're among those "more comfortable" - you'll love him because of his knowledge - no matter how much you already know, you can still learn a lot from him.
Amazing Teacher best teacher I have ever seen
Amazing Teacher
Aweseome
He's very good in teaching in a understandable class hello is one of the best professors and I'm not even from computer science background but still I can still understand the class in abetter way
the best one!
CS50 has been one of my favorite classes.
I'm not done so maybe I can update later. I thought I'd write a review since I taught based on early lectures &amp; taught elsewhere. I have the impression an enormous, incredible amount of thought &amp; effort have been put into this class so it satisfies the goals of those taking it &amp; stays accessible. I haven't seen anything like it. Staff is tops.
Excellent teacher
Great prof.
Lectures are very useful and has a nice vibe to it.
He is an amazing instructor. He is precise and to the point.
Nice lecture
He is the best Computer Science Professor out there
Teacher name: Airaldi, Remo
School name: Harvard University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
great teacher, the class was so interesting !! great experience !
i love the prof so much , he 's great !!!!!!!!!
Remo is the best professor I have EVER had in any subject. He is incredibly passionate about his students and the art of acting. This course requires complete participation -- read the text (it's great!) And do all of the work and I promise you will grow and have a stronger understanding of the material. I honestly can't recommend him enough.
I took a public speaking with professor Remo, and it was incredibly inspiring and I benefited a lot from the class. Remo always tries to help you and he is always on your side to help make it through any difficulty, but you have to do the reading assignment, because if you dont you will have a lot of difficulties in studying for the final.
A brilliant teacher who inspires every single student he works with. It is amazing to me the amount of time, care and attention he gives to everyone in his class. Shakespeare is not easy but Remo's love for the material and his expert, sensitive coaching make these plays accessible in a way I would've never thought possible when the semester began.
Loved every class
I was looking for a class to fill a humanities requirement, and one that would take me out of my comfort zone so I chose drama. After 3 weeks straight of a rocky start due to multiple snow storms class finally began. Remo is truly a gifted and amazing human and professor! He can break anyone out of their shell, gently! Wonderful experience!
I mean i"m not gonna lie or nothing class was hard. I feel like this dudes a solid choice but their was a lot a work and reading it was hard
No words! Remo is the greatest teacher/mentor I have ever had.
Loved Remo. He is so kind, funny, inspirational, and down to earth. He will give you so much individual attention and help you grow significantly. An amazing professor and person.
The most inspirational professor I have ever taken a class with.  For many, this class becomes life changing; classmates who struggled to speak in public at the start were transformed by 'Remo' - as he insists on being called -into highly confident speakers.  I was humbled by his devotion to the class.  He is strict on attendance  &amp; participation.
I  took Remo's Public Speaking class and have never had a better educational experience. He is completely dedicated to making all his students excel and the amount of time and energy he devoted to each and every one of us was astounding. He also happens to be hilarious and as kind a person as you're likely to meet. Great teacher.
Remo Airaldi - Simply the Best in the business.
Amazing class. I'd highly recommend this course  to anyone contemplating the pursuit of any dramatical studies. Professor Airaldi is not only knowledgable  and experience, but he draws the best out of every student.  p.s. Good luck with getting into this course as it's extremely competitive.
Remo's Shakespeare class was spectacular. He is a fantastic teacher.
Remo is an incredibly warm, welcoming individual, who has a talent for bringing out the best performances in actors. He is a joy to work with and learn from. Unbelievably inspiring and generous. Superlatives are truly not sufficient.
I took a class with Remo this semester after reading all the amazing reviews (and having him be recommended to me by many friends). All I can say is, no one was exaggerating. He is beyond belief, both as a teacher and a person. You would be a fool not to take any class taught by him. I never left class less than totally inspired.
Wonderful WONDERFUL teacher. I guarantee you will enjoy and learn SO MUCH from this class. Although it can be a little nerve racking at first will all the speeches you will have to do. I'll be worth it. Don't be afraid to meet with him. He is AMAZING and will show you so much. It is an awesome experience. I really did wish it could go on.
Never in my life I saw so much commitment to a job. REMO's true passion is to help students develop. He challenges  everybody, still fair, according to the actual speaking skills. This course was one of the most valuable experiences of my life. REMO has become one of my personal heros and my deepest wish is to never loose contact to this great man.
Remo is the best acting coach you could ever have. He has helped improve everyone so much. He knows exactly how to break down a monologue and how to prepare for any audition. The most dedicated, selfless teacher I have ever had. I will never go into an audition without thinking about everything he taught me. Spectacular!
Teacher name: Mukherjee, Sri
School name: Harvard University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Amazing! Best professor I have ever had!
Great with feedback! I love when professors take the time to examine the work us students put in, and actually help. Both a great educator as well as a facilitator! Thank you, Sri!
Sri's method is not very productive for some, but extremely effective for others (like me). She gives extensive written feedback and pays very careful attention to your writing. I came into expos knowing I was going to suffer (not a fan of writing), but Sri made it much more manageable. I learned so much with her that I started even enjoying it!
Sri is a superb Expos preceptor who truly cares about her students' academic and scholarly growth. She teaches a rigorous and demanding curriculum that requires students to formulate compelling papers with well structured and progressive ideas, and she is effective. Most of all, her feedback on student work is impeccable and enormously thorough.
Dr. Mukherjee is one of the best instructors at Harvard. Her teaching was largely responsible for bringing my academic writing skills up to a whole new level. Her instruction combines peer analysis, class discussion, and lectures, couched in a literary context, and her feedback on our writing was meticulous and enormously helpful.
Sri was one of the most helpful and instructive professors I've ever had. I learned to craft arguable, sophisticated theses &amp; support my essays with a complex progression of ideas. I also greatly improved my critical thinking and analysis skills. She was not only skilled but passionate about her field, inspiring me to pursue the humanities!
Sri's selection and analysis of sample essays that applied "complicateextendcounter" moves to the authors' ideas really helped me with synthesizing how multiple texts spoke to one another instead of simply reading a source in isolation and laying out what the author's argument was.
Dr. Mukherjee's class was immensely helpful in honing my skills as a writer. Prior to Expos 20.066, I frequently got away with writing "flowery" essays filled with SAT words. That doesn't cut it for Dr. Mukherjee. This isn't a highscool writing class. Dr. Mukherjee, always willing to help but never willing to handhold, is a superb expos preceptor.
Sri is an exceptionally talented instructor. Sri is aware that new concepts she presents take time to implement and gives thorough explanations on how to effectively support &amp; advance arguments. I appreciate her clear expectations, both verbal and written, and her thoughtful feedback. I’m a different reader, writer, and thinker after this course.
Sri Mukherjee is one of Harvard's gems. She is not only lucid in her manner of conveying key ideas, but also genuinely cares about her students' success. She met with me several times outside of class and provided extensive feedback on my work. Two years later, her writing strategies continue to be essential tools in my academic writing at Harvard.
Sri Mukherjee is a highly intelligent and very talented teacher. Most college freshman do not have high school English experiences that prepare them for college level writing. Professor Mukherjee helped me to make this transition smoothly. She helps you to advance your essay and writing using methods applicable and useful in all college writing.
On 5/12/11, I submitted a rating on ratemyprofessors.com. Much to my dismay, I realized that I gave Professor Mukherjee 1's in Helpfulness and Clarity, when my intent was to give her the HIGHEST ratings (This is VERY clear in my comment section). Consequently, I registered to ratemyprofessors.com to modify my error. She is one of Harvard's best!
Sri is an brilliant and engaging professor who teaches students to create strong academic arguments and guides students in the transition to scholarly writing. Her class and feedback is focused on ideas and skills rather than mechanics, which allows students to apply her revisions to all of their papers rather than just her assignments.
Sri is an incredibly engaging  professor. She guides students to arrive at their own ideas and is very knowledgeable about cultural interactions. Her class is very much idea driven, and her feedback on papers focuses on writing skills rather than the prompt, which allows students to grow into their own style as they progress from paper to paper.
Sri is a very personal professor.She works with your strengths and identifies and resolves your weaknesses.She guides students rather than being authoritative, and allows us to grow as opposed to being forced in a particular direction.Her attention to detail is excellent and the amount of individual attention she gives each student is unparalleled.
I have just completed my writing course in Harvard summer school with Dr. Mukherjee. She is resourceful, amiable and eager to offer help outside the classroom. The course is fantastic and I have learned the essence of college academic writing through this fast-paced course. Thank you so much, Dr. Mukherjee and I hope to work with you in the future.
completed 2nd week (12 hours)of summer expos 20 &amp; just finished first one on one conference. prof is very challenging &amp; engaging (plus cute). wish had similar conferences in my other course, really helpful
Before Expos, I couldn?t even use a comma; bouncing between inner-city schools had avoided me writing an essay. Dr. M is not only clear, thorough(applying all concepts beyond Expos),and engaging, but dedicated. She constantly worked with me, even when off. Her dedication literally caught me up to a college writing level: by far my best teacher yet.
Sri was an absolutely fanstastic teacher. Her instruction was precise and clear. Assignments were challenging, but we never lacked direction. Help was always available. I left the class feeling that I was a far better writer than when I'd started.
Sri is a superb teacher on all accounts. She adeptly factilitated class sessions to engage all students in rich discussions that continually challenged and expanded our understanding of course materials. Her thoughtful, thorough critiques of our work reflected her passion for teaching and her strong interest in students' growth.
Teacher name: Garber, Marjorie
School name: Harvard University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Disregard some of the more foolish reviewers on here! Prof. Garber gives some of the best lectures at Harvard (er, or probably at other Ivy). Knows Shakespeare inside and out. Reads the world like a book. Only downside is you really need to pay attention and be willing to, like, learn new words and stuff, otherwise you'll miss a lot.
Nothing else to say about the professor.
Harvard assigned her Great Political Speeches to profit from the speechwriters market, but the course is a complete farce. She will always try to talk about Shakespeare when she feels insecure due to her ignorance about politics. Extremely old and lazy, never grades paper nor exam. The syllabus is a draft and she makes you buy books you wont use.
I made a limerick for this class. It goes as follows:  Through college ranks we have risen,  To a class where no lecture was given,  So we begged Dr. Klug,  To teach Chem in the nude,  But he only answered with, "Metacognition."
Professor Garber was an excellent teacher who knew the material and knew how to guide a discussion. I learned more from her class than any other class. She wasn't overly friendly, but she was never rude or mean. I found her class very engaging.
She has a lot of frustration and she took it out on my grade. I did everything she asked and still did poorly. She is a mean mean person.
I like this prof. Interesting, combines humor with academic material, covers things well. TAs seem almost bothered by having to be TAs tho, like it's beneath them; they do seem overwhelmed tho so maybe just stressed.
Fabolously brilliant! overwhelming literature for the kinddle minded! brilliant!
Compelling and thought-provoking, traditional lecture format.  Clearly in command of the subject matter.  Sometimes makes spurious connections. A moat separates her from direct student contact.  Kind of harsh to her TAs.  Not warm &amp; fuzzy.  A "rock star" in her field but not very approachable.  Have your manager contact her's.
Brilliant student of Shakespeare.  An excellent lecturer on Shakespeare.  Not such a great Shakespearean teacher.  I found that if you did not have a great amount of prior knowledge and study of Shakespeare's writings, then you would be seriously deficient.  I learned interesting things, but the testing was atrociously hard!

She was a fabulous teacher when I was at Harvard - one of the best teachers I had.
This woman thinks her ego is interesting. Freud tells us to go with the unconscious. Who would you bet on? Her classes are turgid- she treats people as if they were her mirrors (makes you feel small in class if you speak up, as if you were the mirror in her makeup case). Avoid this boring Skeletor creature at all costs.
power crazed

INCREDIBLE. The best class I have taken at Harvard yet. She is amazing. Grab any chance you have to take a class with her.
Loved the course.  Next to French Ea, favorite undergrad course

good
one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Fascinating material, engaging lectures.
Hauser is amazingly passionate about the material. it is infectious.
This was, hands down, the best class I have taken at Harvard.  Hauser inspired us all with passion, for tackling the apathy toward science, and for empowering us with our own ideas. His teaching is infectious, and so too is his warmth and interest in the students. If only more professors at Harvard could be so cool and interesting
Glad I transfered from BU to join this professor in his engaing lectures!  Great class and got an A
it is so rare to have a professor at harvard who engages with undergrads, and spends time with them, both working on research and concerned with education. hauser is a pleasure to be with.
hauser's lectures were some of the most fun, engaging and interesting at harvard. the course is incredible. chock full of ideas.
HE IS AMAZING.  Awesome lectures, incredible ideas... I hope I can have him again.
very cool. brilliant mind
i don't get the conceited comment below. Hauser is one of the few profs at harvard who is completely open to hanging out with students, is very approachable, and does freshman advising.  not many like him at harvard.
I second the HUGE ego, very limited expertise, lack of concern for rigorous empirical methods, leaves out all data not supporting his (unfailingly alpha male) perspective. Get ready to hear some very dull and very questionable theories and that bring to mind eugenics and other behavioral science debacles.
his lectures were pretty interesting, though because of the nature of the course, very broad.  he is considered to be pretty conceited, and i hate to say it shows.
very boring. is there a point? or does he just like to hear his voice bounce off the walls? bring a pillow and get comfy. read all of his book and regurgitate it back and you'll excel
Teaches with passion. Brilliant
Very clear lecturer, but ENORMOUS ego. He walks around like he owns the place.
small man. big ego. he's not even a psychologist.
Very clear, good slides, funny stories. HOWEVER- He is on a crusade to lower the GPA of Harvard students- beware!Exams very difficult and tricky, section exams and readings are too many and too difficult for a core class.You'll end up knowing a lot though
this is the coolest lab. great people, really neat work, and lots of fun hanging out with hauser.
really cool prof.  incredible understanding of material. loves teaching.
A fun course, changed the way I look at things.  Hauser is on the anti-grade inflation committee, and exams are very difficult.  Cotton-top tamarins with spray-painted hair rule.
Teacher name: Neugeboren, Robert
School name: Harvard University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
All-around a wonderful professor who cares about the outcomes of his students. Take this class if you are passionate about learning and can take a challenge in stride. Make sure to attend the lectures, and devote a significant amount of time to the p-sets.
Great professor. Most students don't recognize that going to his office hours allow him to talk one-on-one and help you explain concepts. I got an A+ and yes it is true that youtube could be an aid, but TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OFFICE HOURS. Tell him what you don't understand and he will explain the concept to you. Not the easiest A, but IT IS manageable
Never again. Hardest class ever
DONT'T take this class!!! The class is based on one thing and the test is on another. I tried my best for this class and still did really bad. The TA doesn't give partial for the exams even he said he did. I basically taught myself for the entire period.
Hands down the worst class I took. Notation is important in this class, but he and his TA often teach DIFFERENT ways to notate, and then they will take off points if you use one by randomly choosing between the two it seems. Other discrepancies between lecture/section make this an infuriating experience. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS.
I graduated from the ALB program and Neugeboren's class is hands-down the hardest class I ever took at Harvard.  He has his TF teach new material at section (defeats the purpose of section, does it not?) and his problem sets are deceptively simple - you'll get excited that there are only 5 questions, but you'll spend 2 hours on each question.
I like the boy!
Prof. Neugeboren is a nice guy, and knows his stuff. He can be a little confusing at times, but the real misery in this course comes from the Psets and tests, both of which are completely brutal, and 100% written and graded by the TA. The Psets take at least 15 hours each to do, and are overcomplicated to say the very least. Would not take again.
a professional lecturer;  well organized lecture
For a large class, the lectures were remarkably engaging.
Currently taking his ECON 1010. Probably the worst professor I have studied under. He is extremely knowledgable, but does not know how to teach.
Worst prof. ever!I really think Harvard should refund what I've paid for this class.  Textbook, lecture, and section won't help much for the homework and exams.  I was relied on lectures on the youtube and study materials from the GOOGLE.  If you have to take this course, make sure you have access to Google and Youtube, otherwise, you will fail.
Horrible. This class is not a theory class, but rather a calculus analytical one. He reads the slides and doesn't explain anything. When asked a question, he doesn't want to answer it. Problem sets ask questions that are not in his slides nor book he "recommends' reading. Very poor value, you learn nothing valuable in this course.
I actually didn't think he was that bad. I thought he was good at teaching. Material was good, teaching was clear enough.
you'll never regret taking his class.
Expected him to be terrible, but he's actually pretty clear and his lectures are rather interesting!  Am I jumping up and down with excitement every lecture?  No, but I'm not falling asleep--nor am I completely lost.  His slides are really great too.
Robert Neugeboren is perhaps the worst lecturer I have ever had.  His presentation of economics at the advanced level is disorganized and confusing.  I was left with the impression that he had no idea what he was talking about.  Perhaps that is why Harvard College relegated him to the Extension School.
Worst lecturer I've had in 3 years here. Disorganized, unclear. Stood at the board with chalk in one hand, eraser in the other, waiting to wipe off his long-winded way of getting to an incorrect solution to a simple problem.
The worst teacher I've ever had.  Unclear, disorganized, unprepared and ineffective.
best teecher i ever got at harvard
Teacher name: Bamberg, Paul
School name: Harvard University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Paul is an insecure guy who is constantly putting other people down and bragging about smart he is, and by implication, how dumb everyone else is. The class made me very anxious.
Paul is the best math professor I have ever had. Clearly a brilliant intellect with an immense passion for math and willingness to help anyone willing to work hard. Without question, you will need to put the time in, but it's a very rewarding experience.
A great professor. He builds up my confidence to learn math and set up a good foundation for me to learn more advanced topics in analysis. The course is well designed and you have to spend times. But all materials are accessible and the exams are really similar to the problems that you have seen before.
Paul is a stellar professor. The course was very well-structured, with applications to numerous fields--probability, statistics, vector calc, analysis, linear algebra, etc.--and he managed to construct it from scratch in a single semester. I would strongly recommend the class if the subject matter is of greater interest to you than, say, 23B.
not great
Paul has sparked my sense of wonder about math, while also making me feel capable of delving into higher-level courses. He's a great lecturer, but you likely won't understand all the material during class. Some of it's difficult  this is an intro to higher level math after all. A lot of work, but very fair grading and extra-credit abounds.
There is really low regard for wheter students are  understanding what is going on.  R-script the most awful program to do graphics in. Teaches from prepared notes on a projector, but covers what he is writing  with his hand  so it can not be seen.
the whole course is well-organized. lectures are engaging. great sense of humor.
A truly inspiring teacher who motivated me to learn everything he had to teach. He expects a lot, but will bend over backwards to help you learn it. Exceptionally fair grader. He is an educator not a rubric tabulator. I studied physics, math, and computer science with him before going off to med. sch. and always wished that I had time to take more.
Dr. Professor Paul is awesome.He really likes it when you go "BAMberg!!" really loud.Huge Bowie fan and great teacher.
Paul is the man. He's also secretly santa claus so if you don't like him you also hate christmas, and the sound of children's laughter by extension.
HE IS THE SHIT I LOVE PAUL BAMBERG But he should sing more often.
Disregard all the stuff about how bad of a teacher he is. If the 23 class of 2009-10 is any indication, the people who were most apt to complain were the ones who never really bothered to understand anything and instead tried to just memorize statements without the slightest comprehension. Paul's the man and explains stuff just fine. Nuff said.
phenomenal interest-level.  great engagement.  not always easy to follow.  his lectures require a high level of attention, but are well structured and clear.  paul not an easy professor, by any means, but is incredibly fair and will help with literally anything you need, if asked.
Has a good sense of humor, but cannot teach. Changed my plans of majoring in math.
:-/
yikes.....
He cannot teach. He is insensitive to how much (or little) students actually understand. He basically just ruined my goal of majoring in math.
Funny, excellent.
He's a wonderful person with a great sense of humor, but cannot teach. He has a knack for obscuring the meaning and relevance of the material he teaches. He seems to plan his class on the assumption that everyone knows everything in advance.

She is a hard working teacher and enjoys teaching...easy on the eyes and very knowledgable.  Good professor.  To say, "she is out of her league" is just pure pompous".  We all can get the same education with a library card..."news flash -- there is no original thought!" What do people expect?
brilliant, generous, caring, wise
Brilliant, compassionate, magnificent, alert, original, caring, knowledgeable.  An A++++++++ transaction.
Elaine Scarry is a truly talented critic. She is also one of the most moral people I know.
Elaine Scarry is the nicest, most brilliant, encouraging, generous, and insightful professor you will ever meet.  She taught me everything I know about the Victorian novel.  I loved her presentations about Jekyll &amp; Hyde with the film clips.  She is a goddess.

Teacher comments: 
I LOVE MICHAEL SANDEL SO, SO MUCH! HE'S THE BEST! WOWOWOWOWOW, HE'S JUST SO AWESOME, I CAN'T EVEN-!
The best Course I have ever had.
Simply the most engaging and enlightening academic experience I have ever had.  Professor Sandel is a treasure.
Easily the best class I've ever taken.  Professor Sandel is exemplary in his adeptness at the Socratic method; it's never about him, it's always about making the student justify his/her position.  If Professor Sandel is representative of Harvard faculty, I understand the high reputation of that establishment (if, not so much, the high pricetag).
Sandel is GREAT. Besides the fact that the class is interesting, he engages people in a way that would really help them discover something about themselves and absorb what would  otherwise be a boring lesson in comparison.
gr8
His class is pretty interesting, though it's hard not to miss the obvious liberal tilt and indoctrination. Although as a Harvard senior, I wouldn't expect anything less from this fine institution! Take him if you want an easy A and to be brainwashed.
Watched his course "Justice" on iTunesU-- a marvelous teacher with an unimposing way of teaching and a unique ability as a facilitator.
what more to say about this guy. Take and Learn.
Been watching through all the lectures for Justice available online on Academic Earth and iTunes University. Michael Sandel's lectures are fascinating and the way he facilitates class discussion should be studied in teaching school. Thank you to Harvard for sharing this class online!
Great lectures one of the best that I have had so far he is a master.
Sandel was great vs. Summers and Friedman. I look forward to taking Justice this fall.
Sandel is just about the only person who could make Philosophy interesting (to me, anyhow).  He teaches (well, taught) a class with 900 students and still managed to incorporate discussion into his lectures--and pulled it off so well!
Brilliant lecturer. His class will change the way you think about the world. He manages to have an ego without being annoying about it. I can't say enough positive things about this guy as a teacher.
Sandel is a living genius. You cannot be taught by Bentham, Sartre, Russell or Rawls - but Mr. Sandel distils their &lt;i&gt;telos&lt;/i&gt;. The man blows my mind. Take his class before he becomes too important and stops offering it!
Great teacher.  Manages Socratic method with a class of hundreds.

One of the best profs I've had!  Lectures are inspiring and make you question your own deepest convictions, and how you justify them.
Brilliant lecturer!  Amazing command of the material, and wonderful way of letting you follow the arguments for yourself.  He's chosen the right texts and readings for this course.  Too bad section leaders can't all have his style.
Glorious lecturer; he's the physical model for Mr. Burns, but he's much more pleasant

A gentle-man in the literal sense of the word. His speech is a little slow, and as I took the course online, I watched it at 1.5 speed, but otherwise very knowledgeable without a hint of personal conceit, which is something I really respect in a teacher.
He is an amazing speaker with profound knowledge and articulation about Islam and other beliefs.
AMAZING GUY AND PROFESSOR
Super nice guy,test were ridiculous but enjoyed the class.Also he really loves pickles.A jar of pickles will give you 5 extra points on the test.
Dr. Asani provided wonderfully clear 2 hour lectures for my Islam course.  I learned a great deal about expressions of the Islamic relgion and feel like we only scratched the surface.  I would take him and his course again in a heartbeat.  I would add that Dr. Diane Moore assisted in the online discussions and offered significant insight.
Very motivating

Teacher name: Carr, Jennifer
School name: Harvard University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Carr can be a teensy brash at times but you can tell she really wanted people to learn the material and find it interesting; she genuinely tried to incorporate feedback. She did race through some lectures but only because so much material to cover. Hard class but learned SO much and get a notecard for exams. Textbooks helpful but not necessary.
Best Professor i've ever had!!
Bad. The exams are based exactly from the lectures she wrote herself (not the book), because that's how full of herself she is. Students have been trying to get rid of her for years but somehow she's still there. Tough grader because she isn't a Harvard professor but a contracted ad-junk professor with something to prove; grading quality suffers.
Her powerpoints are full of grammatical and spelling errors. Also you will need to go to lecture because her powerpoints list terms to know but she only verbally explains what you need to know. She also talks to much about her kids and family...
Laziest professor ever, easy to get a good grade
Shes horrible
Despite getting an A in this class the tests were quite difficult. The material itself inst difficult but Prof. Carr's lectures are horrendous. There is no introduction to  any of the material and the important slides are often rushed. Go to class having pre-read the lectures and textbook. She flies through material. Poor communication.
Dr. Carr is great! Her course is very well structured and the material is clear with her power point study guides. I usually *hate* watching lecture videos, but I have really enjoyed watching her lectures from home. Other people complain about her  personal anecdotes, but I have found them useful in remembering the class material.
Professor Carr's lectures are extremely long. Her tests are based off what she says in lecture and what is on the PowerPoint slides. The PowerPoints can be anywhere from 50-100+ slides. She has not given any study guides for tests. Many of the open response questions on tests were not about topics discussed in class.
The class itself was easy. You get a notecard on tests and the material is not very challenging. The final was a bit of a curveball though. She is a very lazy teacher though. Each in-class assignment took up 10-20 minutes and could have been completed in less time. She's also unwilling to admit when she might be wrong about a grade or was unclear.
Professor Carr is condescending in her interactions with students. She seems annoyed when you ask a questions or to be more specific.  Lecture is basically her reading the slides  aloud and telling personal stories. Not very approachable or helpful (when approached). Her exams are extremely long. You would be better off taking the class elsewhere.
I took both semesters of A+P in 2015. It is clear that Dr. Carr had read past course evaluations and actively tries to improve her class based on previous student's feedback. I think that her class is now more fair and engaging than it sounds like it was in the past. No textbook reading is required and it is definitely possible to get a good grade.
I felt I could have learned all the material myself, and probably to a better degree while also enjoying it more, by just reading the textbook instead of going to lecture (which are mandatory). Lectures were not helpful, tests sometimes felt like they bad material not taught (i.e. mentioned once in lecture), professor's not very approachable...
This class was a requirement for a nursing program... I would have dropped it if I could. Rambling class lectures, information dumps, massive amounts of readingmemorization, and terrible study guides. Dreading the next semester. :( Typically an A-B+ kind of student, looks like a C for this one.
Worst teacher I've had; doesn't seem to know her material very well, rushes through slides then babbles about irrelevant personal issues--like what she was eating when her water broke. Many typos on all slides. Can't answer a question if it's not already on her slides--which she mostly only reads rapidly over. Answer keys on exams full of mistakes.
This class has the potential to be so interesting and fun, but the professor is condescending, rude, and frankly whiny. She doesn't even seem to enjoy teaching and her assignments range from extremely fair, to out of left field. Definitely possible to get a good grade, but I don't feel like I learned anything and came out with a headache.
Does not care about fostering learning among her students. Is rude on a personal level, and is unclear with assignment instructions. Worst professor I've ever had.
Do not take this course. Exams consist of questions with vague requirements shes outlined in her head. Don't bother asking her to clarify her grading because you can't argue with illogical reasoning. One of the worst teachers I've ever had the misfortune of crossing.
terrible professor. Doesn't care at all about the class. Typos in quizzes and exams. Don't bother signing up, you can get a better education elsewhere.
This was one of the worst classes I've ever taken. The lectures were just her reading slides instead of explaining the topic and the TAs were next to useless. The textbook is created specifically for the class so you can't buy it online, or even sell it back at the end. Unless you already know all the material you're going to have a very hard time

I used to climb up onto the balcony during his lectures and fall asleep. Best nap time ever.
dry, but clear
So boring, but so practical
boring lectures wow really boring
Great! nice to not have to endure communist propaganda for once.
Feldstein is great! His lectures are balanced and fair-minded. The people who complain about him are whiny Harvard liberals.
Great course from a distinguished economist.
Lectures are BORING. Super inaccesible. Infrequent lectures. Real teachers in the class are the teaching fellows who are very good.
Too conservative!
No office hours, lectures are very infrequent and uninteresting. Lectures tend to reflect his personal biases on issues like Social Security, Medicare, the EU and so on, and in general have a Reaganomic tilt.

Teacher name: Grimm, Geraldine
School name: Harvard University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Professor Grimm is awesome! She loves German literature - Kafka, Hesse, and Mann. Try to get a head start on the assigned readings. Professor Grimm likes original ideas and allows creative freedom as long as you can support it and follow her strict guidelines. Also, I recommend taking EXPO-E15 before taking EXPO-E25 at the Extension School.
Awesome professor! Take her for EXPOE25! Class w/ her was fun! You're allowed 1 class to miss w/o penalty. Advice for new students: Follow her essay guidelines RELIGIOUSLY, have a tutor look over your work if possible, get a head starting on reading the req. readings prior to the first day, participate, and have fun with what you're working with!
I am studying Vet Meds and I think she is a excellent Professuer
You're very free to explore writing ideas with her.  What she wants to see from your writing is whether or not you can support her claim.  She cares very much about format, follow the guidelines religiously.  They are there because it will make you a better writer.  Participation MATTERS.  Speak up. Be prepared to re-read your assigned reading.
Dr. Grimm is an outstanding professor. She is a Harvard graduate school professor that has taught classes at Harvard College and MIT. Her teaching skills are second to none. She gives clear instructions to students on how to write papers. Read and prepare for discussions. Dr. Grimm loves intellectually stimulating conversations. I love Dr. Grimm!
Great Professor! Dr. Grimm is amazing! She speaks very clearly and makes dull material interesting. She makes you really earn your grade. If her class was not mandatory, I still would have taken it. What I learned in her class, I will use for the rest of my life! All I can say is, "Take her class, you will not regret it!!"
Great professor and the one and only choice if you have to take EXPO E-25. If you follow her guidelines and re-write your essays (she does not accept drafts) until you are 100% d'accord, you will do well in her class. She is funny, like to talk a little about her life and gives you 1 second chance if you've submitted a very bad essay.
Concise, experienced, profound listening skills, patience of a saint, and all-around wonderful and memorable. Kafka, Siddhartha, German-lit.
she's my hero
Expository writing Professor with a focus on great German writers Mann, Hesse, and Kafka. She is tough but fair. We used Edgar Roberts book Writing about literature 13th ed. as a guide. Assignments need to be succinct no room for fluff. Overall great professor funny and engaged .
Great professor. Fun, easy to understand, and helpful.
Dr. Grimm receives my highest recommendation. A metric example is given at the onset and the material lends itself well to the writing. Dr. Grimm is a master of making a subjective course as objective as possible. Class itself is a fun learning environment, however the structure is rigorous leaving one prepared for academic writing upon completion.
Super prof.  Class was very fun yet challenging.  All German lit used, so the readings are challenging.  Dr Grimm was very helpful &amp; informative.  My writing was 100% better after this class.  Very nice person as well.  Kind and friendly with a great sense of humor.
EXPO is a mandatory class at Harvard Extension if you want to earn a degree, and the content depends on the instructor. Take it with this instructor- she doesn't drown you in reading, instead she makes you tear apart the assigned material and gives you great writing feedback.
Amazing! You have to take her Kafka, Hesse, Mann course.
Great professor.  Her knowledge of german literature and german history is incredible and she has a lot of great insight.  She's funny, down to earth and a great person to get to know.  You work hard in her class, but discussions are fantastic and she really knows her stuff.  Absolutely recommended!
Great professor, professional, interesting, allows and encourages different viewpoints and thinking, very inclusive, extremely fair and she is a great teacher. I wasn't into writing at all and  this was a prereq. class for me, but she made it interesting and FUN. I very highly recommend Ms. Grimm as an instructor.
Nice woman, exhibits good professionalism. I like her a lot!!!!  (P.S. The work is hard only if you look at it as a "mandatory" course, which it is, but at the same time the material is intersting and you can absorb yourself in it and get a good grade!

He's an absolute genius and an absolute hero. Honest, funny and incredibly inspiring. Theo, truly brings to life the most difficult texts. Never did I think I would be excited to spend three and a half hours discussing the Divine Comedy.
I took a writing class from him at Berkeley in 1984. He changed my life. More than a professor he is a teacher. Most professors assume you are able to write, but he makes sure that if you were not a writer when you came into his class you were when you left.
Probably the best professor I have ever had. Complete genius, a stellar lecturer, very entertaining, very nice, and an amazing interpreter of the texts. I, too, took his “Reality, Desire, and the Epic Form” class this summer, where we read the “Odyssey,” Dante’s “Commedia,” and Joyce’s “Ulysses.” Learned so much! More than recommend this guy.
I took his Summer Class on Reality, Desire and the Epic form and it was great! I highly recommend this class!
He's the best! I would take any class he teaches, because he knows more than any other lit prof, and he's so much fun. He's also very encouraging to students in whatever they want to write about -- it's freeing and creative.
I took the Epic Form with Prof Theo 9 years ago - I will never forget those classes. He is brilliant and inspiriational. Great translator too - check out his trans of Cavafy.
I 'heart' Prof. Theoharis.  Brilliant, brilliant, and...did I say brilliant?  He's one of the best professors I've ever had at Harvard (I've taken 20+ classes).
Phenomenal teacher!
I've had Theoharis twice, for Epic Form and a new course he did last fall on Sacred Violence in the American Novel. Truly a great teacher, adviser, friend and human being. Never turn down an opportunity to take one of his classes, you may discover a passion you had no idea was there.
Nimbly follows discussion wherever it may lead.  Genuinely welcomes input and ideas about texts.  Unusual combination of detailed knowledge and visceral accessibility (usually you only get one of the above!) Inspiring, made me want to read &amp; talk more &amp; more and the sea, crimson sometimes like fire . . .
Theoharis C. Theoharis is, by far, one of the most incredible teachers I have ever had.  He is engaging, interested, learned, and very willing to meet out of class to talk for hours on any subject.  He has become one of my personal heroes.  At any moments time he may burst out in a Tosca operetta, or give a Shakespearean monologue to perfection.
Very arrogant and very informative teaching - great energy in the classroom.  You will learn.
Of all the professors I have ever had, Theo is hands down the most interesting and knowledgeable.  His classes were fun and he was always excited to be teaching our class the material he knows best.  Definitely worth taking...
Categorically, a most engaging and thorough specimen. Not merely a man, but an absolute mantis of Joyce's Ulysses.  Ask him about Nietzsche.  Theo, will you marry us?
He is an absolute bore. He is far to concerned with trying to impress you rather than teach you. Avoid this class.
The best professor and best class I ever took.  He's also very hot.
An amazing lecturer.  For 2.5 hours, he kept my interest and seemed genuinely excited about the material.  Knows many languages, cultural references, and is just plain hot to look at it.  Well worth the time, one of the best classes I have ever taken.

One of the best lecturers I've had. Wow, what a stream of eloquence.
Not always scintillating, but still pretty interesting, and probably the nicest professor I've ever had--he tried to get me out of a required class and still asks me how I'm doing and remembers my name, two years after I took his class.

The BEST professor ever. He is extremely not judgemental, has a big heart, and is caring for all his students. I was very, very touched by just how much feedback he was willing to give per paper. He sees the best in you, and is not at all reluctant to give you credit for your hard work. He is a true scholar who is passionate about teaching.
Great professor/ Remarkably personally modest, kind &amp; tolerant/ Talented man who knows how to appreciate talent.
This teacher is absolutely amazing!

Leo Damrosch is a top-shelf professor.  You will not be disappointed.
Kind of mediocre.  I enjoyed the singing, though, and the quizzes that counted as a third of your grade.
Leo Damrosch is an incredible teacher.
This class covered an area of literature I wasn't initially interested in - but the overall quality of the course and instruction was very good.
fantastic lectures, try to take 10b with him as well
Insightful, witty, perpetually engaging
Professor uses crystal clear explication with a shot of humor and personality.  Especially when he brings his fife to class.
great course. take Damrosch &amp; Vendler, forget the rest.
fantastic teacher. his classes crackle with intelligence
superb - the teaching you dream about when you come to Harvard
Best lecturer at Harvard. Witty, erudite, brilliant.

good
Wow
Such an inspirational professor
Michael Miner is incredible! He really cares about students and if you ask for help you will get it, even if he has to give up his free time! He really knows the subject matter and is an incredible writing instructor who taught me SO much!
He is a very helpful and fair minded. Well versed and authoritative on subject matter. Future Professor
Does some lecturing but a great writer. Helpful and going places.
Makes every class worth it...
A knowledgeable guy, and one of the few TA's I have had who does not see the job as an annoyance, or an intrusion on his other commitments. He is genuinely interested in helping his students learn to write with clarity and accuracy; he is knowledgeable about his field, and generous in sharing his knowledge. A rare pleasure among TAs!
Quiet, but smart. Very engaging one on one and knows his stuff.
Straight forward. Work hard, you will do well.
Not a full professor yet but seemed much more capable than the senior faculty. Smart but not condescending, hard to find in this place sometimes.
Summer class.
I did not have a lot of interest in this class but had to take a writing course, so this seemed like a good option. He takes the time to help you become a better writer - you do not get that kind of help in other classes.
This class was not my thing but he helped me get something out of it. Can't ask for much more than that - work with him if you can.
I came into the class an average writer...at best...but I am leaving with much more confidence as my writing has improved dramatically. What more can you ask for?
Reaaally nice guy and makes you work.
Really great fellow - knows his material and helped my writing immensely.

Teacher comments: 
not smart enough for me
Dr. Sergi as class was great due to his teaching style, the case studies and Prof. Li. They are approachable and willing to give guidance. I really appreciate them.
Outstanding professor! Immensely knowledgeable in economics; knows how to transmit that knowledge to his students. Highly recommend!
A great, inspiring, challenging and supporting Professor. You learn a lot and the experience is invaluable!
one of harvard's best professors.
An excellent professor of emerging economies
Professor Sergi is a very kind person.  He is a great professor because he wants his students to work hard and in-turn they do (most of them) work hard because they see how much he cares. I wrote 3 1500 page papers and then had a team paper that was about 5000 words. It sounds like a lot, but it was all worth it and I strongly suggest this course.
A great Professor of Economics. I learned alot from his class especially how the international market is performing with particular emphasis on China, India etc. We got to interact with various guest speakers which enhanced our understanding in the field of Economics. Also, his knowledge in Economics is amazing.
Mr. Sergi is extremely cooperative and helpful. You can approach him very easily and is always ready to help.
Very competent, open minded, receptive, and extremely knowledgeable professor with NYU &amp; Harvard teaching experience. Prof. Sergi keeps the class engaged with interesting topics, guest speakers, and stimulates class discussion. Amazing experience.
The topic of class is very rare, yet up to the point, especially in today's world of economics. Bruno S. Sergi has a deep understanding of the subject. Learning is rather easy, but productive at the same time. He has a good sense of humor and he is very humane to students. You wont regret taking this course with this professor.
One of the best professor I had in Harvard. Very clear to understand and knowledgable about the material covered. He always invites speaker from the professional field to get involve student on the topic.  At the end of the class you always feel to have learned a lot .
Professor Sergi is an excellent lecturer! His technocratic expertise is very impressive! He really cares about his students and is always willing to provide additional support!
best professor I have ever met!
Very clear and concise
He's dynamic and totally into knowledge. Welcomes different perspectives and questions. Lively and humorous lectures. This guy will not try to foist his own brand on you. He seems to lack the common scholar's bias strongly in favor of his own ideas over those of others. He showed great interest in students' understanding and success.
Teacher name: Sahami, Mehran
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Be prepared to work very, very hard if you have had no significant experience with computing. This is an 'intro' class in the same way rocket science is child's play. The good news is that the professor happens to be just the one to make this class great. Professor Sahami and his teaching staff are brilliant, funny, accessible and fair.
He is clearly the best instructor I ever had.
Mehran is great in front of the class. Totally engaging. Wonderful, fun, clear lectures. In person, he has no time and expects you to talk to the TAs if you need anything.
He is AWESOME!
Awesome lectures can't explain with words
BEST PROFESSOR
Wow! such a clear, brilliant teacher. Every class makes you love the material as much as he does.
Having seen the 106a lectures online and liked them, I wasn't particularly expecting anything new. yeah some of the material was familiar but Mehran was so much more awesome in person and such a great teacher, who really prepared me for some of the more difficult computing concepts.
Awesome
I liked him.
One of my fav profs of all time. Textbook needed if you don't have any CS or Java experience but otherwise the class is generally pretty easy. Lectures are recorded.
Best Prof of all time
He shoves a bunch of html, Javascript, CSS, PHP, and forces down intensive computer knowledge down your throat.  He spits sizzling apple juice from his puckered lips and does yoga throughout class.
Mehran is awesome. He is always fun to listen to and he explains everything so well. The lectures are also filmed and uploaded on the course website (same day) so you "go to lecture" on your own time (at double speed).  He is very approachable and loves what he teaches.
He is simply great! ;)
His classes were the highlight of my week.
Mehran is the best. He makes CS approachable for beginners, and his lectures are awesome and are full of funny jokes and candies.
One of  the most impressive lecture at Stanford.  Well-organized lecture and tough course work (programming assignment.) Essential for CS student.
He's great
The best prof through whom I could learn online
Teacher name: Carrasquilla, Kurt
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Kurt is amazing! He explains the different concepts of personal wealth really comprehensively and gave real-life examples. Also, he's available after class, allowing opportunities for individual conversations and questions!
I will definitely take another course given by Kurt. His communication is very clear and understandable. He give the students chance to ask questions and does his best to explain it in a way that everyone understands. He gives us handouts to help us understand the course better and also he uses real life examples to put everything in perspective.
Overall, Professor Carrasquilla's Essentials of Wealth Management's class was inspirational, informational, and well organized. The one main thing that stood out in Professor Carrasquilla 's class is his caring and positive attitude in answering our questions. The handouts and emails were very helpful. Thank you for a wonderful class!
Professor Kurt gave us not only an overall yet detailed guided tour through wealth management but also some inspirations thats I have never thought of before concerning finance. It is definitely a great course. Students can ask questions in the class and will get clear answers right away.
I thoroughly enjoyed Kurt Carrasquilla's class ESSENTIALS OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT. I found his presentation of the more complex concepts to be amazingly simple. I'm certain that every member of our class gained a great deal from his expertise and teaching style!
Kurt was a great teacher, he has so much knowledge about wealth management. He explained the material very well and tied it to concrete examples. Great class he kept the lectures interesting and made it fun and easy to participate.
Same after the course, I have sure that I will use the topics that I had  been learn at class, on my work in Brazil. Kurt demonstrated a big knowledge about wealth management, market in a macroeconomics context, I have no doubt that was one of the best teachers for me. As a conclusion, kurt  helped me to achieve my goals at 2017.
Professor Kurt is one of those teachers you will come to realize truly cares about his students well-being. He was helpful throughout the entire 5 week course, and I highly recommend taking a class with him.
Kurt is a very friendly professor to discuss openly with!
Kurt is a clear teacher, helpful, and always ready to help. He really wants us to learn and is always being  motivational.
Such a wonderful and rewarding class. I truly enjoyed his presentations and he made the concepts easier to understand. Highly recommend this professor and taking this excellent course!
I took Kurt's 5 week wealth management class in summer 2017 and loved it.  Wealth management is obviously a broad topic, but he did a great job of distilling the information into 5 interesting lectures.  He also helped me develop a sense of "vision" for my finances.  I would recommend this class to anyone with low confidence managing their money.
After taking this class, there is a clear framework of wealth management tools in my mind. I strongly recommend this professor. In his class, I learn a lot!
Great course and great professor. Would like to take more of Kurt's courses in the future.
Kurt was good presenter and knows his material along with solid industry experience.
Kurt is an effective, engaging, and knowledgeable teacher. Through him I gained a very good general understanding of wealth management. In each class he incorporates his professional experience, which makes the subject matter easier to learn. I can confidently recommended him to any student who wants to learn about wealth management.
Excellent class.  Professor Carrasquilla was very engaging.  I learned a lot and would strongly recommend him to anyone wishing to expand their knowledge in Wealth Management.
I thoroughly enjoyed professor Carrasquilla's class! He has a ton of experience in personal financial planning/wealth management and was able to transfer that in an easy-to-understand format in the matter of 5 weeks. He covered the most important aspects of financial planning and painted some really important big pictures.
Kurt was a great professor. He was always there for any questions his students had before or after class. His lectures were both insightful and lively. I would definitely recommend this course to family and friends.
Professor Carrasquilla was great.  He was very approachable and often reiterated that he was available outside of class if we had any questions for him.   I would definitely recommend this class and am certainly glad I took it!

good sir and teach from basic on programming
very good professor.
No doubts, one of the best. Very good combination of theory and practice.
I've taught this stuff for decades and Jerry explained it better, and way, way faster, than I ever have. Inspirational.
Great teacher, great lecturer super clear and helpful!
Jerry is the boss! Explains Computer Systems very clearly and really cares about his students.
Jerry always makes the class significantly harder. His lectures go very quickly, if you don't pay attention for 1 second, you're lost for the rest of the class. He's good at explaining, but I feel goes too quickly in lecture and doesn't stop enough to make sure students are getting it. Explanations could be less code heavy and more visual.
He is one of the best teachers out there.
One of the best teachers I have ever had. He explains everything very well, makes it fun, and is also super helpful. If you have him you are lucky!
Very nice one.
He is a genius
Tough, but fair.  Great teacher, excellent explanations
Awesome SUPER Awesome
Good dedicated prof.Looks arrogant but is good.
good lecture; sometime too fast
Great lecturer, demanding and makes sure his students learn significantly more than with other teachers in the same course. His manner seems a bit arrogant and unapproachable, but is actually helpful when asked. His classes are a CS boot-camp, do expect quite a bit of work.
Great and intelligent.
The best one. CS143 is really really i been was very nice. I learnt a lot.
Oh man, Cain is the bomb.
Jerry rocks. Seriously, he's the best teacher you'll ever have.

He made CodingBat website. Its amazing how his efforts helped thousands of students taking computer science like the AP Computer Science to other college intro to CS (Java) courses. Also thanks to Stanford Professor Marty Stepp.
he's great
Really good at breaking down complex topics into its simple components.
Easy to pay attention to !
This class was awesome. A beginner like me that has never done anything further than facebook on a computer, Professor Nick was very clear and easy to listen to. I very much enjoyed the lectures and how easy it was to learn from such a great teacher. Thank you for all that you do
Nick Parlante is user-friednly!. He is a brilliant lecturer, funny, and easy to listen to. Has an incredible ability to present complex material in clear, concise, and engaging manner. My mind is blown!
Great professor! Explains rudimentary ideas slowly so that learning more complex ideas is easy. Such a joy to learn from.
Exceptional clarity and step-by-step teaching practice.
Great Instructor! Made the subject incredibly interesting and has a real passion for computers. I love his teaching style, its very adaptable and flexible enough to reach out to all types of learners. I highly recommend!
Makes the subject interesting. Energy comes through, even online. Nice to look at too.
He is awesome! He helped me cross the  mental barrier I had towards Computer Science and has created an interest in me for Programming. He is great! He is the Best! Thank you Sir!
I knew nothing when I started taking his courses online. He made everything crystal clear and everything seemed easier. He is perfect at what he does. I thank him with all my heart.
Look at this guy on youtube, very thorough and energetic. Makes complex topics simple. One of the best teachers you will EVER have.
I'm an Asian from and living in a non English speaking country and he could make me understand the whole concept, how cool is that?!
Took programming as career just because of him
Best CS Professor Ever. PERFECT
Nick is awesome! I took this Stanford course through Coursera.org.  His way of explaining computer science was crystal clear.  I enjoyed every lecture and feel like I took a lot away from the course!  Thanks Nick!
Excellent teacher! I never thought I will be able to understand Computer Science as it is. But now I do. Thank you Nick Parlante!
A great teacher that can explain the most difficult concepts in a very easy-to-understand way.
YOU ROCK!!! \m/ :D
Teacher name: Roberts, Steven
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Steven Roberts' lectures were phenomenal. Not only were they very entertaining (by far the most enjoyable lectures I've had), but they also beautifully connected the material to the real world. He was also incredibly flexible when it came to meeting outside of class, and he stayed after every single lecture to answer questions. Take his class.
A wonderful teacher, definitely the best professor and class Ive had so far at Stanford. Really cares about all his students and wants them to take something significant / meaningful away from his class.
Steven is an exceptional mentor, professor, and individual. The amount of dedication and effort he puts into setting up a inclusive and engaging environment for his students is astounding. Definitely recommend taking a class with him or even just getting to know him :)
Professor Roberts is quite possible the best teacher I could have in my first quarter at Stanford. Going into the class, I was worried I would be overwhelmed by the serious topic of racism. His lectures and the discussions he leads get the whole class engaged and creates an atmosphere in which everyone can share their opinions and learn. Amazing!!!
Genuinely a great guy. Bless up.
This course is a must take! It will change your perspective on race, racism, and yourself. The class is discussion based and participation is mandatory! The more that you put in to discussion, the more you will get out of it. Sections are always interesting and the work load is very manageable. Highly recommend taking a class with this professor!!
Steven Roberts is an AMAZING professor and really dedicates his time into making this class the most informative experience that it can be. This class truly opens your eyes to the intricacies of building racism in America and definitely recommend it to all people. Amazing class and don't miss out on a chance to take from him!
Professor Roberts makes an incredibly important and difficult subject approachable and powerful. Take this class if you care at all about your role in a racial hierarchy no matter your skin tone. These are the most important lessons you can learn in college and beyond.
Great introductory race class from a professor who clearly cares about the subject matter. Definitely recommend.
Steven is an absolutely amazing professor. Every day he pushed me to reconsider what I thought I knew about race and racism, and upon finishing his class, I feel more prepared to take on the world around me. I would recommend him and his class to anyone. Thank you, Steven!!!
Amazing class, amazing environment.
Amazing course! I learned so much, and Steven is an incredible professor who genuinely cares about his students learning. The class itself is a space that welcomes vulnerability and genuine discussion about highly relevant issues regarding race, racial identity, and discrimination. I'd take this course again if I could.
Professor Roberts really makes this course what it is. The passion and level of organization put into this class deserves way more recognition. It's a great class that expanded my intellectual curiosity. Switched my PWR to take it. Don't regret it one bit.
Amazing guy! Super invested in his students and what they take away from the class. Have a blast!
Steven is so far the best professor I've had at Stanford. He truly cares about the class and the well-being of his students. You'll learn so many life lessons in HTMAR, plus make great friends! He gives great feedback, challenges your beliefs, and is always willing to help. 100% recommend taking this class and any other class that he teaches.
Professor Roberts is the best professor I have ever had. I learned more than I ever could have imagined, both about myself, and my peers. He's an extremely caring and compassionate person, who was always there for me when I needed a bit of extra help. He is truly one of the best people I have ever met, as well as the best professor.
This is my favorite class all-time. I learn so much and the professor was really good at making an open class environment where we could share and learn from each other. The class was so relevant to life today, and I learned so much about the world that I live in. If you have a chance, don't pass up taking this class!
Really great professor.
Wonderful professor who makes his classes relevant and engaging to the world we live in today, brings a great energy to the classroom and truly wants to hear students' perspectives on the topic rather than just lecturing at you
Very personable, understanding, open, and engaging
Teacher name: Tendall, Mark
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
"We know in our hearts"  This guy is a great lecturer; he's very clear. But, he's also quirky. One of the best lecturers I've had at Stanford, up there with Scott McKeon
ok lecturer.
Prof. Tendall teaches you the mathematical steps to solve very specific types of problems.  Of course, no one actually learns what anything means, but at least you can get a good grade without understanding "hard" concepts!
Great professor.
Mark is a nice guy and is clearer than many professors, but his teaching style is terrible.  Rather than helping students understand concepts, he focuses on simple computational rote learning.  If you want a very straightforward class where you *don't really learn anything*, you will like this class.
good at explaining things and pretty funny
Wonderful Professor. A brilliant academic whose enthusiasm for economics is contagious. He is interesting, funny, and nice.  He genuinely cares about his students and their success.  I am happy to have taken a class from him.
Really clear and concise.  Great, funny guy.
Solid professor, and a good guy too
Really funny and likes teaching.  Exams and problem sets are straightforward.
very confusing. i understood this stats in 9th grade but can't remember any of it now.. his lectures are sleep-inducing and perplexing.
Horrible teacher.
Such a nice professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to learn. Psets and exams are generally straightforward. No surprises there.
super clear, very easy to do well if you just pay attention.  no tricks on his tests.
very funny, lectures were good, exams fair, but problem sets were intense
Funny in lecture, very student-oriented.  Always available outside of class for help.  Fair exams.
Great professor. One of the best I've had so far.
Absolutely amazing. Turns some people off because of delivery but has very clear and helpful lectures. Also the nicest guy in the department.
Has weird speech delivery.  Should be more direct.

terrible - nothing has needs to be said.
he is very good something
What a beast, he is the all time greates teach Eva!!!
The greates
A brilliant intellectual and gifted mentor!  One need only read his 'The Lucifer Effect' to understand why he is among the foremost leaders in the field of  Psychology. His students should be honored to be a part of his academic conversation.
He is his best promoter. Left wing to our detriment.
A mixed bag.  Zimbardo is entertaining and insightful, but also highly egocentric and arrogant.  Seems more interested in demonstrating how brilliant he is than in really teaching—more of a showman than an educator.
Passion: 28% F

Kind of full of himself, but hell, he's the****.
funny, interesting, likes to talk about himself a lot
I love his movies! Especially the talking picnic basket! He's double hot! I love his approch to studying 'UMANITY.
He was always helpful and interested and made a personal commitment to undergraduate students.

Class is easy and entertaining.  Unfortunately, Zimbardo is more of a showman than a teacher.  Take it if you're looking for a fun class and an easy A.
Zimbardo gave me back my faith in Stanford. Psych 1 redefined my academic trajectory.
hes an amazing psychologist. i loved him as a teaher
Teacher name: Moylan, Chris
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Don't know why everyone is giving this guy a bad review. He's the easiest professor I've ever taken. Basically paid money to get free A+. I showed up to syllabus day and left halfway through and haven't been to class since.
This guy goes to my high school in san jose. He thinks hes better than everyone just  because he went to standford. If he calls on you and you dont know the answer, he waits and humiliates you. If you have the wrong answer, he rolls his eyes back. Other teachers also dont like him. Overall, drop chemistry if you are going to have this teacher.
You can never feel comfortable to ask questions in his class or else he will tend to make you look bad or say something sarcastic
Most knowledge professor
Honestly, Dr. Moylan is the worst teacher to ever step on my high school campus. His snobby and arrogant attitude, accompanied with his unwillingness to help his own students, creates an aura of negative tension throughout the class. His tendency to purposely fail anyone whenever possible is due to his anemic attitude of thinking he was successful.
He as a resource was completely unhelpful. TAs didn't seem to know what was going on either. His tests tend to be almost exactly the same, so check previous terms' tests. This was the first science class I'd ever been in where the entire lecture hall unanimously responded "NO" when a professor asked, "Did that make sense?"
this class is pretty alright. the lectures by moylan are really great, but the lab TAs are confused and there are extremely unclear directions and expectations for the lab period. they grade the labs way too tough, but know what you're doing and you'll be fine.
If you listen in class, do your work, and have half a brain, you'll do fine in Moylan's class. Many of my classmates were whiny pre-med students who wanted to learn ONLY what's on the exams and nothing more. If you're so lazy and want everything spelled out and spoon fed to you, why the hell did you apply to Stanford??? A's are EARNED,you whiners!
By far, the worst professor that I have had at Stanford. I am no longer interested in chemistry at all as a profession.
Moylan is extremely high on himself and was didn't seem to care at all about the students in this class.
The class is too much work. You do learn a lot though and in the end it is worth it. I liked it. This must be taken with a grain of salt because I also enjoy dressing up in latex and being whipped. He is not a bad lecturer. Unfortunately he does not lecture on everything you need to know to complete the lab reports, the rationale being that you nee
Way too many assignments: 3 10pg lab reports, 4 20min orals, 2 midterms, 2 5pg lab tour reports.  One or two assignments due per week - made it hard to keep up in other classes.  On the plus side, he is a better teacher than our other chem profs, and the grading wasn't impossible: the curve was: 1 A+, 7 A's, 1 A-, 7 B's, 1 C, 1 F.
Moylan is a terrible teacher; avoid him and this class if at all possible.  First, the class is a ridiculous amount of work - more like 10 units, not 4 - and second, he doesn't teach anything.  So you're expected to teach yourself all the theory for everything.  And you're at a major disadvantage if you haven't taken 153 - so be warned!
Moylan is the worst teacher the world has ever seen. He gets pissed off if you ask him a question.
CHEM 36 isn't that bad, but 130 is hell. Moylan is the worst teacher I have ever had. If you try to ask him anything he will get pissed off.
Avoid this teacher AT ALL COSTS.
This class was pretty easy. I did my work and got an A period. The exams are super easy. Great lecturer, dressed up as Harry Potter first day.
Although did do this cool Snape-impersonation thing at the beginning of Chem 36 last year, he's annoying.

Teacher name: McCaskey, John
School name: Stanford University

Teacher comments: 
Moral Foundations of Capitalism was a great class! Professor McCaskey is very passionate and engaging. But be warned: he will cold call on you and if he suspects that you haven't kept up on the reading he will send you an email entitled "Are you keeping up?" Very very worth it though.
Moral Foundations of Capitalism with Prof. McCaskey is a wonderful class. I ended up changing my views about many of the authors we read and learned a lot about both the supporters and detractors of capitalism. Definitely one of the most interesting classes at Stanford. I would recommend this to anyone regardless of political persuasion.
Professor McCaskey has lots of energy and enthusiasm for the class, which made me much more excited about the subject. He is incredibly helpful and always willing to work with students outside of class to make sure they understand the material. He also gave great essay feedback and helped us outside of class to improve our writing.
Phenomenal teacher. I learned more in this class than I have in any other class at Stanford.  Really challenges students to think critically and to thoroughly understand concepts.  Very approachable.  Was determined to schedule time with students outside of class if he felt they weren't fully grasping the concepts.
Moral Foundations of Capitalism with Prof. McCaskey is an excellent class. Prof. McCaskey challenges every student to challenge and formulate her personal economic and political philosophy or at least understand and challenge those of the writers we read. He is readily available to help and is a great asset to his students academic careers.
I took the Moral Foundations of Capitalism with Professor McCaskey, and it was a great class.  Professor McCaskey is all you could ask for and them some: smart, fun, helpful, and caring.  I looked forward to going to his class because it was fun and I learned so much.  He is also a fine writer; your writing will improve if you take his class.
Professor McCaskey is good at helping students think about the course concepts. He did this by relating the readings to each other, providing readings with different moral arguments, and giving us detailed feedback on completed papers and drafts. The class environment made it easy for students who weren't familiar with the material to participate.
Professor McCaskey is everything a college class needs. His course provides a variety of viewpoints on ideas that are important to students and demands nothing but the best thinking from all.  Best professor at Stanford thus far.
Professor McCaskey opened my eyes to an entirely new world of that that I had not previously explored.  He did of incredible job of helping grasp complex philosophical concepts and begin to formulate my owns opinions and judgments on the subject.  He shared a genuine excitement for the material that was infectious and inspiring.
Professor McCaskey is an amazing professor. I took Moral Foundations of Capitalism, and it helped me formulate my own beliefs much more coherently. He handles discussions well, he brings a lot of passion to class, and his explanations are crystal clear. It was the best class I've taken so far, and I recommend that everyone try his classes.
Professor McCaskey is a talented educator. I looked forward everyday to attending his class and sharing the excitement he brings to learning. He did an incredible job of teaching a difficult subject and addressing the variety of student backgrounds and needs in the course. I highly recommend that everyone studies with McCaskey during college.
Professor McCaskey's enthusiasm for course material was contagious. The course was well designed with a clear progression and development of central themes. I took a lot away from the course and highly recommend Dr. McCaskey to other students. He's one of the best professors I've had at Stanford.
Professor McCaskey is everything higher education needs: a teacher who cares about his students, incorporates a wide variety of  viewpoints, and thoughtfully prepares the course.
This class was great.  McCaskey knows his subject, and his enthusiasm is infectious.  Even students who had no prior interest in 19th century philosophy of science seemed engaged and excited.  Overall, a great experience.  Take a class from this guy.
Professor McCaskey is by far and away the best professor at Stanford university. I have never taken such an enjoyable and interesting class. He is thoroughly devoted to teaching and every section is an exciting opportunity to hear his brilliant insights and learn from excellently lead discussions with your peers. He is an incredible professor!
Prof. McCaskey is amazing.  This class was one of the best classes I've ever taken, and most of that is due to his way of teaching and engaging students in meaningful and insightful discussions.  Awesome!
the class was very enjoyable, largely due to Dr. McCaskey's charisma and an excellent reading list.
this man was enthusiastic and passionate about the course. the course covered 2500 years of the history of science and logic, and he was versed in every topic of discussion. he is as likable as he is intelligent. if you like the history of science and want to read Newton, Galileo, Aristotle, Heisenberg, Copernicus, and others, this is the course!!
He is a great teacher whose enthusiasm is contagious.  This was the most enjoyable class I have taken at Stanford or anywhere else for that matter.
Prof McCaskey was awesome, especially with the small discussion class we had he was great at leading our talks and really emphasized student involvement. The class got really passionate, in large part because he relayed his own enthusiasm to us. I'd love to take another class with him, or just the same one again!

Teacher comments: 
avoid.
Favorite professor
a well meaning teacher, totally unfair class. proofs graded subjectively. TAs and teacher contradict each other and get salty when you ask questions.
Keith's great and this material is super cool! Just too much of it to learn all at once.
Love him!!! 103 has been such an interesting class! Wish I could take a seminar with him and learn more!
Keith Schwarz is an extremely talented CS teacher. He is organized, clear, and loves his material.  His lectures inspire you to love computer theory too.  But he and his TAs have an extremely punitive grading  style that makes one dread this course. Learning should not be punishment. Computer Science should not be about gatekeeping.
Good professor, but makes nearly any class ultra hard
Simply one of the best teachers I've ever had! He never gives up trying to help you understand.
So great, wonderful lectures, totally caring and helpful. he really helps you understand computer science
Hands down one of the best professors at Stanford. He's totally organized, clear, and super interesting to listen to.  Keith really inspires you to be great and helps so many people make sense of computer science.
Caring, clear, and really passionate - I can't recommend Keith more highly. He is extremely available in office hours and takes time out of lectures to answer student questions. He's really adamant about taking questions, and that's part of why he's such a good teacher.
Easily the best instructor I have ever had in my 8 years of college and graduate studies. Difficult class but there is no better place to take it or instructor to take it from. Course taken through SCPD.
CS 103: Keith is a great speaker/motivator. Class started off with wonderful lectures; very clear theorems, proofs, and explanations. Near the end of the course, some important concepts (PNP, R, RE, etc.) may not have been explained clearly enough, as many of my peers were lost. Midterms/final not graded leniently so be very, very specific.
Really well prepared. Does everything he could to make you succeed.
Inspirational. Well prepared. To the point.
I never review any professor. Keith, however, is the best professor I've ever had. I'm short on ways by which I can give him the recognition he deserves.
Best professor I've ever had!
Extremely engaging lecturer. Keith might actually be the best lecturer at Stanford. He moves at a lightning pace, yet somehow manages to be clear. Take his classes.
Keith is the greatest! He explains everything really clearly, is incredibly helpful, and clearly loves what he's teaching. Definitely take a class with him!
just a great teacher. you can tell he loves his job and wants students to learn

Great philosophy professor really helps you grasp the big picture
One of the best profs at Stanford. Clear, great lectures, very inspirational
Awesome, smart, helpful, hot
Best professor I ever had at Stanford. His class on existentialism changed my life.
Lanier Anderson is the most obviously brilliant person I've ever met, and likely the best professor as well. He clearly puts a lot of effort into writing and rehearsing his lectures, and it pays off; they are fascinating. I am stunned that there are people who don't recognize how amazing this guy is.
Passion: 28% F
Best teacher of my life! And totally HOT! :)

lanier has this awesome way of knowing your name and referring to your point and how it fits into the discussion
Insightful, eloquent, wonderful at engaging a great discussion
Very good class, but his co-professor (J. Landy) takes the spotlight.
****!!!!!!!!!!!
Co-teaches an excellent class on Phil and Lit with Joshua Landy
This dude was unintelligible.  My dad came to visit (he's a college professor), and he said it was the worst lecture he'd ever heard.  Lanier's smart as hell, and I think an interesting guy, dedicated to teaching, but talks too damn fast, and reads too much from lecture notes.  I think I'd dig him in office hours, but lectures?  SNORE.
HARD AS HELL
No Comments
Read from lecture notes too often.
HE IS VERY HOT!! BUT DONT LET HIM FOOL YOU!
He was a good, solid professor.  I enjoyed how wrapped up he was in BEING professorly and performing the role well.  It really felt like one was studying philosophy in the grand traditions of the discipline.
Who cares how he teaches? He's hot!
Teacher name: Sapolsky, Robert
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I don't even go to Stanford, but some of his lectures are online and I've learned more from them than any of my actual classes.
Does an excellent job of explaining tough material.
Dr. Sapolsky's class is absolutely incredible. He's easily the most animated and engaging lecturer I've had. Each lecture is around two hours, but it almost never feels that long. I would highly recommend this class (and anything else taught by Sapolsky) to any person with the opportunity to take it.
Human Behavioral Biology, offered through youtube and iTunesU, is easily the best class I've ever taken. I highly recommend it to everyone. Sapolsky's passion and understanding of behavior will benefit everyone no matter what they are studying.
One of the best teachers in the world. Taking a Dr. Sapolsky class is one of the great experiences of a persons life.
best
Sapolsky is legendary.
Best teacher in the Biology department by far
Amazing prof.
Amazingly great teacher
Best teacher I've had --- hands down. And probably the best class I've taken at Stanford. There are simply no words to describe the experience. He is funny, animated, approchable, makes materal accessable for understanding, and just blows your mind by the connections he makes between different fields. You are literally on the edge of the seat..
The Best prof I've ever seen.
Best class. Period.
There should be a portal into Spolsky's head. Freakin. Great.
you must take the class before leaving Stanford. One of the best at Stanford.
One of the best classes I've taken at Stanford (no wonder it always has 500+ students).  Sapolsky's amazing.
No Comments
Took this some years ago when I was on campus.  Sapolsky managed to mix amygdalas, hormones, and stories from africa to make a class with 100s of students feel like it was a class of ten.
Human Behavioral Biology is the best course I have taken at Stanford and Sapolsky is by far the best lecturer I've ever had here.
One of the best lecturers at Stanford.
Teacher name: Starkman, Ruth
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
This woman is like a reincarnation of a GOAT, she is literally an OG at everything. Hands down, one of the best profs I've ever had. The campus literally revolves around her. However, sometimes her class can get difficult, but it really do be like that sometimes. Either way, she helps you understand it; most importantly, she actually cares for you!
Ruth Starkman is TheGOAT, a very inspirational speaker and teacher, who helps you build intuition to solve hard problems and write about them like a philosopher and a programmer. She may be the only professor at Stanford who has truly crossed the fuzzy/techie divide.
Ruth Starkman was my teacher 20+ years ago at Cal. not only did she remember me when I contacted her recently, she remembered my work and our conversations, and wrote me a recommendation the same day. Amazing.
Energetic lectures on tech and ethics, clearly loves her subject. But be prepared. She'll walk up to you and ask a question about Kant or code or ?? Starkman is the OG.
BEST PROFESSOR EVER
Professor Starkman is a little intimdating. She's very welcoming in class and encouraging. Then she rips your work to shreds. Literally. Every. Word. But then she shows you how to improve and she makes you want to do better. In the end you do OK, make friends in class, and learn a lot.
Here's the thing  with Professor Starkman. She's super smart and has zero patience for dogma of any kind. Don't just come in and spout off your private theory of ethics. You will just embarrass yourself. The reading is hard . You need to do it before class and be prepared. See her in her office hours, she's not that intimidating in person.
The stuff I learned with Professor Starkman has stayed with me for years, and when you go back to visit she remembers you perfectly like no time has gone by. Ask her for help on job apps and gradmed school, nobody goes the extra mile like she does.
The one professor who's taught  me most in my Stanford career.
Starkman's lecture on ethical frameworks is the most interesting lecture I've heard at Stanford in all my four years. She's cool too, the only professor I know brave enough to take 106A
She rocks! Ruth helped me on all aspects of my work, from the writing to the ethics and integrating course readings. She totally kills it as an editor for all your school, professional and entrepreneurial writing too.
Great teacher. super clear and helpful, fair-minded, non-ideological, supportive and inclusive of everyone. Readings are super hard, so ask for help!
writing and ethics, this lady kills it best, see her in hume and see the light.
She's really good at helping you articulate your own ideas, but make sure you do all the writing assignments, esp the daily ones, these add up a lot and really affect your grade
brilliant, hilarious, and yes, totally in your face, she wants you to learn and do something in the world!
Rumored to be super chill, she even tells you it's easy to get an A if you revise and pay attention, but if you slack even the slightest, she's will let you know EXACTLY why your work was subpar and then some. BEWARE!
She's super smart, cultured, laid back. But intense too, makes you to revise, revise, revise until you do A work.
Awesome professor! Classes with her are always fun and inspiring!
Starkman the merciful, helpful, and awesome, unless bring doom on yourself
The best professor I have had, ever.
Teacher name: Roberts, Eric
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
It was such an honor to take a course with Professor Roberts, he helped me see how cool the concepts like recursion are. His books are terrific too!
This Professor embodies computer science as we know it today.
So excited to be taking a class with him, his books are so good and he represents the best in the history of computer science
Genius teacher
Roberts is the master!  Great ability to explain ALL important computer science concepts you need to know! Be sure to talk to him after class --there's always more to the lectures.
rarely does a reputation live up to expectations, but Professor Roberts is truly amazing. I hope he doesn't completely retire, he's one of a kind professor who knows both arts and sciences. His books are amazing too
Legendary
Reason why I understood recursion and algorithm!!
Eric Roberts is a great teacher, and his textbooks are top notch.
Smart guy! Very passionate about teaching and you can really sense he actually likes teaching undergrads. Programming assignments are fun - they can get rather time consuming towards the end of the quarter.
Eric Roberts really did a good job in this class. He managed to make the class fun and interactive and I enjoyed his lectures. He tought me the IHUM Technological Visions of Utopia.
Loved this class!  Very dedicated to teaching, willing to help students. Also took 201 - Computers, Ethics, and Social Responsibility from him, loved that as well.
Extremely nice man - interesting lecturer with a warm personality.
I took his "visions of utopia" introsem and it was tons of fun. there was a lot of reading, but eric is really cool and always structured class well. not to mention, he invited us over to his house to watch the movie of 1984 and eat a full home-cooked dinner. it was greatly appreciated, especially as a rest from dining hall food. he's just a really cool guy.
Great professor, committed guy.  The reason I'm a CS major.
Eric Roberts is an amazing professor!
terrible course once you get past a certain point; for me it was like hitting a conceptual wall, and he just couldn't explain it anymore.  he's a really nice guy tho.
His lectures are very clear and helpful.  Class wasn't a transformative experience or anything, but was reasonably fun and interesting.
He lectures well, but when you ask him for help, he talks in metaphors and high-level language. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DO MY ASSIGNMENT
What a crazy beard
Teacher name: Clerici-Arias, Marcelo
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Marcelo has definitely been my favorite teacher while at Stanford - he is very engaging (even at 9 am) and is extremely clear. He explains concepts very well - after all I was a freshman with no experience in Economics and still did well in his class (and enjoyed it) even though there were plenty of people who had taken AP before this class!
Great class, must take. Amazing professor and the nicest guy
My biggest issues with him is he is not very clear and doesn't get to the point. Also his droning voice makes me want to leave. Felt more like him talking aimlessly w/ the class just sitting there and self-studying for tests.
Material was interesting, but his accent was annoying. Teaching style wasn't very clear, and he is pretty arrogant. Not a difficult class if you study. I would recommend a different professor.
He's the sweetest man in the world.
I love Marcelo. He was an awesome teacher.
Awesome prof.
Very good lecturer, especially for freshman. Easy to talk to and was very concerned about students learning material. Both prof. and class recommended.
Very good lecturer for the basic econ class I took. Some times took a lot of questions which made the class go slow.
He explains everything clearly and is really friendly
Very nice guy and pretty good lecturer.
He's a very nice and helpful man, but often is not as clear as I think he could be
No Comments
Incredible!  Always willing to help you out.  Oh, and he'll remember your name.
I took him back in 2000, he was cool cat taught iternational and money and banking well.  I got a job trading on wall st. and his stuff actually helped. Brooklyn Stand up!
Awesome teaching!. Makes material really clear.
Mildly entertaining... loves PowerPoint. Does a good job of bringing current events to lecture, but the lectures themselves go by sooo slowly.
Great teachning!
He wasn't a very good teacher, although he is a nice person. His accent got on my nerves.
Completely loved his Econ 1 course. It was packed from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
Teacher name: Khayms, Vadim
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Hilarious guy with dry Russian wit, but also fair and caring.  Decent lecturer with very good course readers (no note-taking!).  Do your own reading in textbook and  course reader or you won't be able to work the HW problems.  The CME 104 text (Greenberg) is excellent and covers CME 100/102/104 material; buy it before CME 100 and thank me later.
one of the best profs I've had
He is a nice guy
Definitely in my top three for teachers at Stanford. Pretty hilarious and his accent makes everything a bit more fun. Very willing to explain and the textbooks he writes are much better than standard published ones. Very strong emphasis on actual use in industry, which makes his problem sets feel a lot more relevant. CME 104 was ridiculously hard
He likes to make jokes, and he often completely changes the problem when explaining it so students are forced to think outside the box.
Funny professor but difficult class. Be prepared to devote at least 8 hrs a week to one problem set
Funny.  Humor is a bit on the dry side, but it's quirky good.  Lectures are really really helpful.  Really willing to stay after and answer your questions.  Makes psets hard but tests easier.  AMAZING at teaching a concept, really receptive towards you interrupting and answering questions.  Definitely taking him for future classes.
Great class. The workload is very intense, but very rewarding in the end.  The teacher is very nice and helpful.  I look forward to having him as a professor for my upcoming math classes.
Great teacher.  Hard class, but very good.
Awesome teacher. Looking forward to taking the next few classes he teaches in my math series.
Great lecturer, clear and well-paced. Funny without effort.
One of the best courses I have attended at Stan so far is CME 106 and the fact the Prof Vadim teaches it is the icing on the cake. He makes the class real fun to learn. And has the ability to explain the difficult stuff in simple terms. Overall a great Prof teaching a great course!
One of the best courses I have taken at Stan so far. And that too taught by Vadim is like an icing on the cake. He explains in such a way that even the most "difficult" topic is easy to understand
Too Hard!  Good sense of humor but too much work...it dominates my life!  However, a very good professor, his material is very real-world and he is very comprehensive in lectures.
Nice.
Very Good.
His classes are the hardest I've ever taken, but they really are the most rewarding. You will walk out of that class knowing all the material, and it will stay with you
Vadim gives a heavy workload, but his lectures are very comprehensive and he is always willing to help students get a better grasp of the materials. He definitely showed me the application of mathematics in engineering in the real world.

Vadim is awesome! His class is really hard, but everything you do is useful and helps you learn, and he's very clear at explaning things, and quite funny in a deadpan way too!
Teacher name: Vo, Jacob
School name: Stanford University

Teacher comments: 
Get yourself an attractive professor who can really get down at an EDM concert. Definitely one of my favorite professors so far. Not only is he incredibly intelligent but he can also be very laid back and relatable to all this students.
Great professor! Very caring and accommodating.
Awesome professor and incredibly understanding.
Definitely one of my favorite professors so far. Truly knowledgeable and he's a cutie too.
Probably one of the youngest professors I've had so far. He has an awkward personality, which makes him really cute and personable. Highly recommend taking his class.
He's very young! Enjoyed his class for his personality and charm. Enjoyed learning more about Education through his teaching methods. He will crack a joke here and there to make sure the class stays engaged. Also, who wouldn't appreciate a good looking professor, right?
So genuine and kind, really enjoyed taking his class! Explains things very well and clearly. Is very accessible and approachable.
Most humanistic lecturer in Education-- very charismatic, animates the material very well.
Interesting course to take. Probably won't take it again since he mostly relies on his TA's to grade and answer discussion questions.
HE'S A TRUE GEM! He's hilarious and awkward at the same time but he knows his stuff. I would take his class again if I could. Definitely the highlight of all my classes at Stanford so far.
This is his first year teaching at Stanford and he did an amazing job. The stuff I learned in his class will help me advance in my major.
He assigned way too much work for an undergrad class but overall, he's pretty chill. I wouldn't take his class again because I don't have to. It's easy to pass if you put in the work.
By far, one of the most material-heavy undergrad classes I've had. However, he's pretty understanding and will be available for assistance if needed.
He's really funny and inspiring in through his knowledge about Education.
He is by far one of the nicest and youngest professors I've had. His lecture slides were amazing and he seemed to be very passionate about Education. To those that are planning to take his class, be prepared to work hard. Overall, he's an amazing professor.
Professor Vo is very passionate about Education. However, he sets such high expectations for his class, which could be very overwhelming. He's a wonderful professor but I wouldn't take his class again due to the workload.
Professor Vo expects a lot from his students but he does try to be helpful outside of class. He assigns a lot of readings so be prepared for that, but a few of them are very interesting if you actually read them. He's also pretty funny in an awkward kind of way; I appreciate that he doesn't just lecture from his podium.
I had to drop his class due to the overwhelming workload. Sure we get to work in groups but he expects such rapid deadlines. Don't take his class if you don't have a flexible schedule.
Hes really funny and a little awkward. Like everyone else, he gives a lot of work but hes a professor with a great personality and seems like he really cares.
He dived into lecture immediately on the first day. He's was a bit comical and awkward, but that was probably because of it being the first day. He knows what he's talking about, but like the other reviews, I wish he wouldn't give as much work. :
Teacher name: Zelenski, Julie
School name: Stanford University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Julie Zelenski is a strong teacher. Knows what she's talking about
Julie is an awesome teacher.  She knows the subject deeply and the TA's (particularly Michael Chang) are outstanding.  Many other students are also very helpful. One of the best classes I've taken.  Understand that unless you are gifted at computer programming you will need to work very hard on this course.
107 is a really hard class but Julie makes you understand all the work is so important if you want to be a programmer
Julie is a great professor, and the CS107 topics are very interesting (even if tough at times). If you're at all interested in what happens under the hood when you run a program (or if you just need to satisfy a requirement), take this class. Make sure to leave time for this class if you want to get the most out of it.
Incredible professor, really cares about how much students learn.
concepts are not taught in thorough way
Superb.
She can be a bit much with her fake enthusiasm and like the guy before me said is not very helpful if you have any questions. If you're expecting a Mehran Sahami, Jerry Cain, or Eric Roberts caliber teacher, you'll be disappointed. Oh well.
Not helpful
Awesome lecturer, fun lectures
Great teacher!
She was a great prof. and renewed my interest in Computer Science.  Is a great speaker, and helps imensely in after hours.
She's actually on maternity leave now, but I think she'll be back.  She was a very good, clear lecturer.  Received a standing ovation at her last class.
Looking back (I took the class years ago) she's one of the best profs I had at Stanford. Given her work outside the University, it lends good perspective in the world of academia.
A stellar lecturer, always eager to help students learn the material - but the midterm had its way with me.

Enthusiastic teacher and knowledgeble - tends to be a bit irritating at times. Interruped my final midway to tell the class to stretch!!

Lectures and textbooks were bad.  lecture notes were good.
he's a grandfatherly professor who means well, but he's totally incomprehensible and his lecture is just babbling/regurgitating lecture notes. at least for me, it was really rough, plus 43/e&amp;m is the toughest of the 40s series... i'd really avoid him if you can
Great speaker, kept material interesting.
Very nice, caring, helpful person--very smart--thank you
Really nice.  His enthusiasm in lecture makes physics actually bearable.  He loves doing demos and gives u lecture notes every class, huge bonus.
Notes are incomprehensible. Did not make sense in any of the lectures at all. The class only made sense once I did my problem sets, otherwise was completely useless. Has a strange sense of humor though, has a flair for being theatrical and goofy. The final was suprisingly easy, said it was his "christmas present" for us.
great great man
he reminds me of my grandfather. i loved it
he is unaware of his own arrogance
Shows a lot of concern for students if you approach him, though that's made rather difficult by the horde of students fawning over him during office hours... dare I call them Nobel groupies?
pompous, arrogant, uncool
difficult class, made more so due to confusing, diffuclt, arrogant professor.
His lecture notes are kind of illegible and his lecture can wander off. Likes to mention his award in class a lot. Approachable, though.
a pompous little man.
This guy really loves teaching, and it shows.

A true blessing. A wonderful man and amazing instructor. Passionate about his work.
An engaging and inspiring teacher. His lectures are clear and he makes you understand why learning the material matters.
The most inspiring professor at Stanford. Brings in real material into every problem and is the most encouraging, approachable, funny lecturer - he encourages everyone to apply AI to benefit the world/social good.
Chris is a smart and inspirational teacher. His examples help bring the subject to life.
THE BEST PROFESSOR!!!
Chris Piech is doing amazing things with CS109. HE's so clear, interesting and helpful.  The material is tough, but it's rewarding to do such interesting psets and have such great lectures.  He's the BEST!
The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires. Chris absolutely inspires! His classes are phenomenal!
Chris Piech is everything! A natural teacher who loves his material and gets students to love it too. I want to be all that, do what he does, live that amazing life of being a great teacher at the world's greatest CS department.
Most humanistic lecturer in any science-- very charismatic, animates the material very well.
So genuine and kind, really enjoyed taking his class! Explains things very well and clearly. Is very accessible and approachable.
So lucky to have Chris Piech! I am not good at math, and never thought I could learn to program, but he makes the class so accessible and clear and is so helpful in office hours, I'm finally getting it, thank you, thank you!!
What a great teacher and role model for computer science majors. He's so dedicated and enthusiastic, he makes me want to do what he does.
A wonderful, natural, deep teacher, who really knows how to help students see the bigger picture of Computer Science concepts
Passionate lecturer, good use of microsoft paint. Loved his class.
Amazing and passionate Professor.
The most engaging lecturer I've ever had - Chris is bursting with energy and with awesome examples that make the material come to life. Never expected to say this, but CS106B was probably my favorite class I've taken at Stanford because of Chris. I really can't offer high enough praise.
Chris is clearly passionate about teaching. He is one of the best lecturers I have had at Stanford.
Awesome teacher.
Very passionate and knowledgeable teacher. Really instills a love of AI in his students! Highly recommend!
Teacher name: Sanderson, Allen
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Sanderson is absolutely hilarious and really interesting.
Amazing caring professor
One of the best Econ instructor I have met so far
Basically you'll do well in the class only if you spit his opinion of things back to him.
I took the summer session micro and macro course which was condensed into 5 weeks. Was super tough but hard work paid off.
Greatest guy ever, he has the heart of gold.
Just do all the readings and pay attention to his lectures. The book will give you an understanding of the concepts and the lessons will consist of a brief, superficial overview of the concepts. 80% of his class is basically applying what you read to a real-life situation.
I took his summer Macro class a high school student and it was the best best class I have taken. He was the only reason I applied to UChicago so I could take his class again. I would have change my intended major from ChemE, which UChicago doesn't have, to Econ just because of how great he is. Anyone who said anything bad about him is too liberal.
One of the best professors in the school. Hilarious, engaging, commands the room. Exactly what a good professor should be.
Took for both macro and micro. One of the best ever.  Always highly accessible outside of class for extra help and academic curiosity.  Won the Quantrell Award as best undergrad prof. and deserved it.
A good prof, very helpful in his hours
Sanderson is an amazing teacher who really knows his stuff! The only thing one needs to do in order to be successful in this class is show up in class, read the book and listen to the lectures.
A hilarious man who is sometimes misunderstood. The bottom line is that he knows his Economics, is extremely helpful outside of class, and just might be the biggest troll East of the Mississippi.
Professor Sanderson seems to be a pretty polarizing guy, but I appreciated his snarkiness in lectures.
Very good professor who teaches students how to think as an economist would. Clearly it is an intro class and so can't expect much depth in the subject.
Sanderson is dry, but some of the topics he covers are interesting- will "tell it how it is"...show up for class (ask the people who got 10 out of 42 on the first exam if they should've went). You can get a B+ in this class fairly easily just read, go to class, and take notes. NOTE: Do not take at 9 AM M/W, you will fall asleep
Knows his stuff. Not for everybody. A lot of students go in expecting a sympathetic liberal view of the world. Newsflash: It's an econ course. He teaches theory and application, not value judgments. If you're not comfortable with somebody not qualifying things with "this may sound horrible, BUT" then look elsewhere.
Snarky and pretty smart. Occasionally went off on odd tangents, but not too bad.
Tests are about 30% subjective and he is indoctrinating and presumptuous. The material was the only thing that made the class bearable.
He is truly engaging. He makes it all interesting. You must take his class if you want to know the essence of Chicago Economics.
Teacher name: MacAloon, John
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
One of the most brilliant men I have had the honor of learning under. He can be hard work, but it pays off. I would never have been admitted to a PhD program without him.
He hasn't really done much to earn the title of "brilliant."  His lectures were well organized, but he relied on others to teach.  Publish?  Please.  Teach?  A little.  It seems he has been mailing it in since the 1996 Olympics.
Professor MacAloon is a smart man. Echoing others - he is quite arrogant. Significant reading load but doable. Didn't think the course was very difficult, but extremely useful in order to gain "perspective."
He's a hard ass and volatile to deal with. Especially if you show the slightest attitude. (Be deferential and you won't have any trouble.) On the other side, he's got something big to teach you: His lectures are absolutely inspired and will alter your view of the world some. And that's what you go to the U of Chicago for, he's well worth your time.
this man's teaching is amazing. his course was so important to understanding academia. those who have left negative comments about ego are most likely "that kid" types who were shut down. those there to learn will appreciate how he does not tolerate egomaniac students. his class was fascinating. also, great dry sense of humor.
An amazing prof
Great guy
It's nice to be reading Weber again, so I'm predisposed to having a favorable feeling about this class.  But really it is just fine.  MacAloon is really dedicated to giving us MAPSS students his full attention:  He memorized everyone's names and important info about us (there are like 180 of us!)and is really hands-on in the program.
Is really not a good lecturer. I wish he'd realize that relying upon one's lecture notes so heavily is not good teaching. He also needs to learn time management/when the class ends. I also wish he'd learn how to explain concepts more clearly.
this guy is so full of himself, he should not be teaching anymore.
The coursework is exceptionally important. This is one of the best courses I ever had.  It's hard to tell how great he is or how much the preceptors, texts, and collective interest of my classmates had to do with making this class special.
Regardless of whether he is brilliant or not, he is certainly presumptuous and rude.  But could certainly harm you if provoked. Regardless of status or brilliance, I find any incapacity to treat others with dignity as relevatory of some self esteem issue somewhere.  Tread lightly and with sagacity.
prof macaloon is one of the most captivating, brilliant, and remarkable teachers i have ever had..anyone who comments on his arrogance should know it is well warrented-the man has hundreds of webpages, is respected around the world, and i feel luck to have taken a class with him!
Guy is very full of himself, aggresive when questioned in any way -- and likes to gossip about other faculty in ways that are not appropriate IMHO.
bad
cool guy, very interesting and smart. those of you who complain ab/ his arrogance must not have spent much time in the university atmosphere...or in the world in general. a genuinely good guy who is often fascinating in class.  he sometimes speaks brashly, but anyone with social skills can realize he's joking. he will really make you think.
No Comments
I don't think I have to mention the ego. Yes, it's enormous, and mostly unwarranted. But he does have a (very dry) sense of humor, which makes some classes more bearable than others. Pay attention to your preceptors, do your readings, and you'll get a lot more out of his classes than his lecturing would permit.
Yes, there's an ego there, but you're at the UC, so what exactly are you expecting?  Guy studied under Victor Turner, so he knows his stuff.  Plus, if you take the time to get to know him, it's worth the investment.  Not the clearest lecturer always, uses that UC-speak (i.e., jargon-laden speech meant to confuse).  You get out what you put in.
amazing professor! his teaching is an experience. he's brilliant.

Teacher comments: 
I really enjoyed Mearsheimer's War and the Nation State course. Possibly one of the best I have taken in the Political Science department at the University of Chicago. I highly recommend it if you are interested in studying International Relations. Be prepared to do a lot of reading though.
His idea is inspiring, you can learn a lot.  Huge amount of readings, need a bookshelf if you can't find E-copies.  Tough grader. Treat his students good, still with some arrogance.  Recommanded only for students who like challenges, willing to sacrifice GPA, and not target at Ph.D degree.
Lectures were rambling and a bit boring. In his graduate discussion section, he made an antisemitic comment.
Mearsheimer is egotistical and hates to be challenged. I took his course on Nationalism and Globalization, and it quickly became apparent that he hadn't read any recent work on nationalism and globalization (recent being w/n the last decade). He was not an effective teacher or lecturer either.
Very interesting and knowledgeable lecturer. Unafraid to offend people and state his opinion.
He has his opinions pretty well set. I suggest incorporating his opinions into your final paper if you want any chance at a good grade.
Brilliant. Charismatic. Terrifying.
His ego is bigger than anything else and he prides himself on being a real jerk.  Plus he is a misogynist and has very offensive views on the subject.

Sometimes confuses teaching and debate with an opportunity to criticize people and talk about how wonderful he is.  At other times, his classes can be engaging.
runs the class like a tyrannt
While I did well in his class, I wouldn't recommend it for the light-hearted.  He seems to take genuine pleasure in tearing down other people's ideas.
when i took his class the cold war had just ended and i found all of his views on the end of the cold war as extremely offensive.  his attitudes towards women that may have noted were dead on
fine prof. Has a strong viewpoint but open to serious debate. Fair.
a lot of reading, like his class is the only one we're taking
Great class, great prof. But he's a jerk. Yes, he is condescending to women, but I did well in his class.  I took his class 10 years ago - I'm still inspired by his lecture, still bitter about his attitude towards me and the women in the class. However, I highly recommend his courses.
lots of reading, but you learn a lot!
Mearsheimer is a rather well-known offensive realist who you ought to take at least one class from during your time at Chicago. He's a pretty interesting lecturer, but there is always a lot of reading + a tough exam.  Take everything with a grain of salt.
I disagreed with him alot, but respect him.  Very intelligent and a genuine nice guy.
Clever professor, excellent lecturer.  Don't miss his class

The most energy I have ever seen a professor put into teaching in my 4 years at the university. Very accessible.
He's an extremely helpful and approachable professor.  The material isn't always easy but you won;t have too hard of a time if you visit him during office hours.  I would say he's not as difficult as people say he is.  You just need to ask for a lot of help which some people aren't comfortable doing.
too old to be teaching. teaches regular physics at an honors level. This is not helpful for people that aren't really really good at physics
Prof. Abella teaches a very rewarding E&amp;M course. He presents advanced mathematical framework in E&amp;M whenever possible. He also holds his students to very high standards on homework, attendance, and participation (a very good thing).
Isaac Abella is nothing short of an extraordinary teacher.  His lectures are clear, explaining the material in an organized manner that leads from one topic to another with a fair amount of fluidity.  I took his Honors E&amp;M class(142) and while the problems were very difficult, they were certainly fair and we were well-prepared.
Dr. Abella was THE BEST professor I had in college. Not only did he love the material he taught, he was a socially conscious man who cared deeply about helping undergrads understand their place in both academics and society at large. I miss my talks with Dr. Abella and I hope he is still doing the same for other young students.
I had him for my Freshman Physics class back in 1984 and he is the one who got me interested in becoming a physics major.  I loved his enthusiasm and teaching style.  I ended up getting my PhD in Physics because I had such a good experience.
I went to his office hours and found him very helpful, even though I was over my head in his course.  His course was difficult, but he did his best to make everything clear.  He strikes me as a man with a conscience, someone who cares about students and about making a positive impact on the world through his teaching.  Fine, but still, I got a C!
Fairly easy, but just not a very interesting or helpful teacher. Not worth going to class.

Abella is the sweetest man in the world!
Excellent professor.
quirky and challenging; best out of three physics professors ive had at u of c
Excellent professor.
His board notes may be all over the place, but he's brilliant.

Teacher name: Austen, Ralph
School name: University of Chicago

Teacher comments: 
I had the pleasure of meeting Professor Austen at an introductory mixer before beginning at UChicago. He has high standards and little time for congratulatory nonsense. His grading is indicative of these values. He is intelligent and has a dry wit. Be prepared to act like an adult, and have your assertions challenged. Always do the reading.
Worst professor I have ever had.
Literally the worst teacher ever. Good job converting someone who used to love religious study to someone who will avoid it in the future. I'm done with this I'm going to go be a physics major
Smart, but pretty terrible at teaching. Worst prompts I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of terrible prompts.
He should value students as student standard not professor standard
Awful professor, he only assigned one paper topic and left most students confused about what he wanted. He refused to answer most questions asked after paper was assigned. To put it simply, he's an old hack and you should switch to a different section at all costs.
Odd fellow.  Specializes in Africa, but seems to hate Africa.  I respect his opposition to anti-semites; he managed to work that into every lecture.
Don't take his class in the morning. You will fall asleep for sure. even with five espresso shots.
Never waste your time on this professor's class.
An exceptionally horrible Professor. He offers very little feeback and is very, very disorganized when assigning material. Not only would I not recommend his course, I would strongly recommend his resignation from the History Department.
I'm amazed at the consistency of perceptions.  He's the worst.  I re-took the same class with a different professor. I enjoyed it and got an A.
I took 7 classes with this man some years ago.  He's easy to hate, but you can actually learn quite a bit from him if you can handle the criticism he drops.  Like the Knicks defense of the mid-1990s, he doesn't hold back.  Actually writes good rec letters if you do your work well.  I can see why so many despise him, but his persona has a warm side.
Very little feedback, uninterested in meeting with students.  Try not to take a class with him.
He's a pretty harsh grader, but I thought it was pretty easy to get a good grade from him b/c all he expected on the paper was a regurgitation of the material covered in class.  He was arrogant, but not more than any other professor here.  Knew his stuff.
Wow- this dude is so bad.  definitely don't take his class.  You'll hate yourself for it.  he grades very harshly and offers minimal comments.
Yes, he's a crotchety old man, but he really knows his stuff, and if he knows you really want to learn, he'll always go the extra mile for you. I had a great experience in his class.
These comments are completely unfair.  Ralph Austen is a great professor, extremely helpful.
Worst professor I ever had at the U of C.  He was just unbelievably pompous, incompetent, uneffective, cold, annoying!!!!
Terrible. I want my money back.
Horrible
Teacher name: Rawal, Viresh
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Phenomenal professor; always included strange or beautiful chemistry on exams.
Hard, but helpful and definitely very smart! Really enjoyed his class, but I had work very hard!
Rawal is a great teacher! Hard but funny and really great lectures
Rawal is a great professor. He is difficult, but if you're willing to try hard and understand the material he will help you. He wrote 15 recommendations for me at once when I asked him. His bad ratings come from pre-meds and bio majors who fail to grasp the concepts, don't seek his help outside of class, and blame him for their ineptitude.
I had this professor last year for ochem and he was by far the best out of the three. His lectures were both clear and interesting since he supplemented the book material by giving us real life examples such as explaining the chemistry of febreeze (none of which was on midterms) exams were also reasonable. Overall, an intelligent, approachable guy
He's not easy, but if you get to know him and TRY, you will do fine.  ***He does not like fake people.  If you put on a show about how you want to be a doctor because you REALLY REALLY care about people, he won't be impressed.  If you acknowledge your faults and strengths (and work hard) he'll respect you and you'll get a very fair grade.
Get out while you still can.
Wonderful professor, the best chem teacher I've had so far. He was enthusiastic and clear. Homework and tests were challenging enough to be interesting, but not unreasonable.
I commented already but I'd like to add that Rawal has definitely improved since all those negative comments were made last year. He is friendly and helpful and tries to have a sense of humor... (You gotta do the assigned readings on time though...)
I liked Rawal, especially considering how afraid I was of the class due to all of the comments on here.  He was very clear and quite funny at times.  The tests were killers though...
Really clear lecturer, explains things well.... (I've heard people say his lectures are hard to follow, but any lecture would be hard to follow if you didn't do the assigned reading!)... I have attention problems but I have no issues following his lectures.
MOST DREADFUL prof at the Univ of Chicago! Often complained of how poorly we did. He definitely knows his stuff;  very nitpicky, condescending, &amp; his lectures don't correlate to exam material very well. No connection to students, adores his OH ST students
He and TA's were great for advanced o-chem lab. Quite a lot of work though.
I don't agree with his teaching approach, but overall he's a decent guy.  His problem is that he doesn't realize the reason students do poorly on his tests is not because they don't study hard enough but because his lectures are really hard to follow.
An abrasive idiot.  Obviously hates students, and teaching.  30% average on midterms is proof of his inability to connect with students.
Good but hard.
Meanest prof I've ever had. Most condescending person ever born.
Get off your high horse, Rawal.
Most unhelpful prof who recommends dropping the class if you are having trouble!
Rawal is a tough teacher and you'll not have a good time in his class.  He lectured my class for 40 minutes when the midterm was graded, commenting on how students at Ohio State are smarter.  Students don't need condescending remarks from profs!
Teacher name: Veeder, William
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Thank God this man exists.
He's nice enough I guess. But he B'd me. And the TAs do a lot of work
Bill Veeder is hands-down the best teacher I have ever had in my entire life. His teachings inspire my own, and I can't read a Gothic text without seeing what he helped me to see. He is a brilliant reader, and this makes his lectures and classroom discussions rivetting. Put aside your ego and bask in the great fun that his classes are!
great
The first time I received a 'c' on anything, but I didn't mind.  I often refer to him as my '5 percent' professor.  He was wonderful.
AMAZING lecturer.  Like going to the movies twice a week.  Runs a tight ship that doesn't have room for discussions outside his own literary preoccupations, but still so much fun.
a bit of one trick pony.  Vibrant, thorough teaching style but his 'readings' of various novels and stories are all old school freudian oedipal dramatics (which is almost refreshing in a very Marxist school).  Worth a single class but then move on
Brilliant, helpful, and hilarious. Whilst he is very passionate about his own theories, he grades you on how well you present what you feel, and makes you feel like a million bucks when you come up with something new to him. He is a rigorous grader, and a stickler for detail. Also: HOTT.
Veeder is an outstanding showman, but also a lot of smoke and mirrors--in reality, he can be phony and narrow-minded.  Every dome is a breast, every post a phallus:  one often feels that the class is being taught by a horny sixth grader.  And woe betide you if you are not an attractive female.
Love him or hate him-- that's how it goes.  He is a performative professor, comes prepared to entertain, provoke, and enlighten.  Despite the schtik, he cares genuinely about teaching and students. Be prepared to read great books and be entertained!
the man is freakin' hilarious, his lectures are as entertaining as they are insightful. his reliance on psychoanalytic theory can get tiresome at times, but his energy and wit more than makes up for it.
veeder is truly the greatest professor on earth. i do not exaggerate. enthusiastic, entertaining, precise, intelligent, helpful, you name it. not to mention sassy and hot.
The crucial thing about this class is that IT TAKES GETTING USED TO. Veeder calls it a progress course and refuses to see it otherwise. His comment on my first paper was a rude "You can clear read," and I ended up with an A. Booze jokes abound i
Outstanding, sharply witty, energetic, and one of those professors who excites you to read and discuss texts in depth.  One of the two best profs I've ever had.
Let him have his lexicon.
Very cool guy---funny as **** too. Can be narrow minded in class, but open minded in papers. He just requires a TON of proof for whatever you have to say.
Definitely an interesting class but dude, Veeder needs to stop the Freudian analysis because he would totally disregard people's interpretations if it didn't include "anal or oral fixation." He can also be very arrogant and paper comments were v
Veeder is a god on earth.
Sucks majorly.
Incredibly interesting, dynamic, well spoken; I love every Veeder class I've ever taken, and I'm very picky. GREAT PROF!!!

Good lecturer, but has a sadistic streak. Complained that a paper I spent an extra month after graduating working on wasn't publishable in Shakespeare Quarterly. I wasn't even specializing in Shakespeare and had only a few weeks to produce the paper. Refused to look at drafts and then wrote A/A- so that I wouldn't know my grade until I checked web.
Shuts down ideas that he does not agree with.  His way or the high way,
The best professor at UChicago. Amazing.
If he does not like you he will sink your career.

A little intimidating, but incredibly intelligent and interesting -- I took as many classes as possible with him b/c he's just that good.

I think Richard Strier is better marriage material than Al Franken or Michael Moore.  And his class ain't bad also.
Strier is an excellent teacher and superbly learned.  He genuinely loves literature and ideas, and conveys his excitement to others.  One of the few professors here to work with for grad students who prefer aesthetic/text-centered criticism to historicism(s) or theory.
You won't find anyone more knowledgeable about the metaphysicals.  His book on Herbert is wonderful.
Very knowledgeable. His courses ARE interesting, especially if you appreciate English literature!
helpful but not extremely interesting

Teacher name: Bevington, David
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He didn't stroke my sensitive and privileged ego.  He wasn't warm, didn't seem to take any interest in my petty personal problems.  I had to read books, and my notions of being a "special" person were violated by his insistence on assigning me actual work.  Oh why can't I be granted a diploma based on my superior high school transcript?
Dr. Bevington is a rare, exquisite scholar.I had a wonderful time in his class in 1999.  The guy is brilliant; it is a fun class, and I could definitely see why he is a world renown scholar. Never condescending. Also, an easy A.
Fantastic Teacher.
History and Theory of Drama is the easiest class at the university. by far. Bevington is a shakespeare genius and a one-on-one conversation with him is enlightening and amazing. a 30 person class, however, is not as great. 
 But he's a real scholar. Ask him to talk to you about "Shakespeare in Love"
His classes were completely random and often very shallow. I was amazed to see how anybody so obviously intelligent and learned could teach so badly and without ever saying anything interesting.
No Comments
Everybody loves Bevington! Does he still host charming "receptions" at his gorgeous Hyde Park residence? I've never felt so cultured as when I spread brie on a melba toast in his dining room while discussing King Lear.  Pure class!
knows absolutely everything about the Bard.  Very unorganized, democratic teaching style which is often taken advantage of by students who want to hear themselves talk.

Well-known for being one of the best the University has to offer.  And he is.
As others have said, the soul of generosity and kindness:  but this does not a great professor make.  For all his accolades and experience, I expected a lot more...and he never prepares his classes.  Genial, lazy, stream-of-consciousness teaching.
an incredibly sweet man. very down to earth, very endearing. a bit soft-spoken and therefore not the  most engaging lecturer. but don't let that discourage you; you get what you give.
David is the single most unfailingly gracious professor I've ever known.  His mind is first rate and he is unstinting in his intellectual generosity and generous with constructive criticism.  Take advantage of his office hours - learn everything!
Its just cool to go to B&amp;N and find an edition of the Complete Works of Shakespeare edited by your Shakespeare Prof.
David is warm and generous as a teacher.  You get what you put in to his classes, and there are few Shakespeare academics with his depth of knowledge and teaching ability.  Take advantage of his office hours and you will thrive.

Boring, dry; no doubt he's brilliant (and he's very likeable) but nothing constructive about lectures/discussions and certainly nothing profound or interesting. Too much reading, too little time to discuss adequately.
Extremely nice and enthusiastic.  provides expansive feedback on assignments.
Teacher name: Cohen, Ted
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Cohen uses anecdotes to elucidate the concepts that are hiding in different texts. This is particularly helpful when dealing with authors with more, shall I say, obscure styles (*cough* Kant). And, by way of these practical examples, the material stays with you if you put forth the effort to listen well - just an excellent professor.
My only regret is I didn't take a course from him until my senior year.
good
Some may think he gets sidetracked, but when you look back on the class, one realizes that everything he says is totally applicable to one's education in the broadest sense.  Take classes with this man.
Very stylistic lectures, amazing and insightful with bone-dry wit.  Just a brilliant, brilliant man.
amazing!
Genius. Funny. Caustic. Goes off topic but it's almost worth 40,000$ a yr. to hear him speak. One of the smartest people most of us will ever have a chance to listen to, so hang om every word!
outstanding, if you're smart enough to follow him
chain-smoking, joke repeating, but awesome.
Very helpful. Listens and encourages participation of undergrads unlike other snob/bore prof's who dislike teaching undergrad courses.  GRAD STUDENTS MAY HOLD THAT AGAINST HIM, THOUGH.
Very difficult.  Clearly knows his stuff, but does not stay on topic.
very good on austin.

horrible
Candace Vogler is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is brilliant, caring, and a delight to talk to. I can't recommend her classes highly enough.
Mesmerizing.
Professor Vogler created an interesting environment in our Ethics class. It was almost laid back, but at the same time we were all very invested in what she had to say. I did not find her pretentious at all, but a fellow traveler on the road to figuring out "the good."
She is one of the strangest people I know. It's funny since she likes to say that philosophers are weird and bad with human intereactions, well she fits the profile better than anyone else. I found her to be rather unhelpful outside the class.

Brilliant. Easily one of the smartest people I've met in Academia or real life. Yes, she is challenging, but I found her very accessible, aprroachable and open.
A bit hard to follow.  Obviously highly intelligent and curious about everything (save conservative values).  Needs to work on being more approachable or will end up like every other brilliant inaccessible prof.
She is like Betty Boop with the mind of Heidegger:  bubbly, goofy, brilliant.  Her lecture style needs help, of course, but she is doing her best, and really does care about teaching.
There are two choices: be her cheerleader and part of her academic coterie, then anything you say or write will be solid gold -OR- express disagreement, or don't worship those she does, and you will be branded "the evil other" and everything you write or say will be rubbish. Suck up to her = A
She was nasty to non-leftists.  The core course was very politicized; the reading list was dominated by Marxists and leftists with few dissenting voices.  Turned a required MAPH writing colloquium into anti-Israel indoctrination, with a flawed history of the conflict and an animus vs. Israel.
This woman was even stupid enough to admit to us that she had only started reading Lacan the year before. Most scholars spend their lives trying to understand him.  Full of hot air (and herself) nonetheless.  Class A dillettante WITHOUT a knowledge of critical theory OR a backbone. ditto re: tenure
Snore...  she was lame
She is incredibly annoying. A total b*. Unless you act like a hip liberal. And laugh at her insipid jokes. I did well in her courses tho. How the hell did she get tenured?
NO! imo, she is arrogant as heck and, worse, subtle at being arrogant. i have consensus from several ppl on that. the "-chuckle/scoff- if you can't see that you're not intellectually hip like me" attitude needs to GO. teach some marx. hated it.
nothing short of brilliant, engaging, charming, challenging, encouraging...she is the ultimate mama bird of critical theory. you will fly!

The easiest class I took at this school. Great teacher and well prepared.
Not a helpful professor.  Grading system is flawed
AMAZING CLASS! although this class is very easy, doug's funny jokes and powerpoints save it from being too boring. plus, i found that a lot of the issues we talk about are prevalent today- we talked about how unstable New Orleans was the year before Katrina happened! By far, the BEST way to fufill your phy sci requirement!
perhaps it's not the most rigorous class, but he's a very good speaker and he knows his stuff.
so borrrrrrrrrrring
I'm sure he'd be an excellent teacher if he didn't tend to teach total joke non-science-major classes.  Really, I'm as glad as any other English major not to have to go to phy sci ever, but he takes it pretty far, nice guy &amp; c. though he is.
Awesome dude!!!!!
An average third-grader could probably get an A in this class. Doesn't seem to know anything outside of actual physical science although course integrates biology and archeology. Shows Tomb Raider clips instead of teaching. Class is a waste of my life.
Super good guy, Doug rocks my socks!  Take any class you can from him, my fav. teacher at this school, and im an econ major ;(

He's actually wonderful.
Professor Cohen is extremely knowledgable.  If you want to learn something about Renaissance art (and you should), he's the man.
He's a little slow sometimes, but once you get used to his lecturing manner, he is very interestin and extremely knowledgeable about the subject. He makes subtle jokes and pretends that they are serious, so if you catch that, it hilarious. Leonardo&amp;Mich was very informative but at the same time not very hard. Cohen is very nice an understanding.

Cohen is a genius and has a great, dry sense of humor. Too bad it only comes out when he's not lecturing. He often goes 20 minutes overtime and is never on sechedule with the syllabus, so discussion sections make no sense when we are learning about Massacio in lecture and Grunewald in section!
I took my Art History Core requirement with Professor Cohen, and it was dreadful.  I've had some incredible Art History classes at the U of C, but he was more dull than should be possible.  He gives no expections for what to expect on exams, his paper comments are not constructive, and he perpetually ran late.
He's not THAT bad... Does speak in a monotone, and does keep you late after class, but also incredibly intelligent; practically a walking art history encyclopedia. Just try picking his brain.
Echoing other posters about his lectures, the "comments" on papers were more akin to fault finding rather than helpful constructive criticism.
chiaroscuro baby. pedagogically inclined. his milanos bring all the girls to the...finals.
Ugh. He droned on and on, repeated himself time and again, and had no respect for the demands made upon student's outside of his classroom. It was criminal how boring he made such exciting material (Renaissance art) sound.
I could only stomach the first few weeks of the class. Although the material was very interesting, the class was dreadful, to the point where I couldn't make myself attend any longer. Had I not dropped the course, I would've hated Art History forever.
One of the worst classes I ever took at U of C. The material was interesting but Cohen was always behind in the syllabus, late to class and made us wait all the time. He even was late to the final. very unclear and confusing lectures too.
Shows up late every day and was late for his own final. Blabs on and on and on without ever saying anything. Excruciatingly dull--avoid like the plague.
I have to second the first poster - this prof is terrible! Avoid him at all costs! His class just drags on and on and on...you'll want to die instead of going to his class by the time 5th week comes around.
Boring...and comes to class late; He also makes us stay 20 minutes late. A very smart man, though; it is clear he knows his stuff. He just has a hard time getting it out succintly...

Hands down best teacher I've ever had. Had him for little red schoolhouse, which was great. Extraordinary lecturer. Also had him for his first run at Writing Speeches: Reagan &amp; Obama. In the small setting he is brilliant. Deft unpacking of Heidegger. Truly a remarkable facilitator of discussions.
The best course I ever took at U of C.  Larry is an absolute genius who will blow your mind by opening up everyday text and uncovering more layers than you could have ever believed were there.
My best class ever
Everyone loves Larry!
This is the best class I took at Uof C. Professor McEnerney taught me how to write and it has made a huge positive impact on my life professionally and academically.  Take the Little Red School House!  You will be really glad you did!
This is the best course I took at U. of C., and I had come to study graduate English--not Education.  But Larry's class is completely engrossing, pleasantly disorienting, and endlessly thought-provoking.  Unlike most professors at the school, he is never research first and teaching second...because his "other life" does not involve research at all.
One of the best teachers I had, a must-take course.
He is such a great professor, you learn a lot about writing in his class, it is fun and interesting.
Larry is a god of rhetoric.  If you want to learn something you'll use, this is the class to take.
he is really smart and fun and challenging
this remains one of the best courses i've had here; it helped my writing improve dramatically.  he gives tons of feed back, and really spends time discussing students' work with them. he even runs his writing seminars, rather than having a TA.  i still go
best teacher i've had at u of c, hands down
How can you possibly assign a coveted pepper to one who habitually wears a sport jacket with jeans?

Teacher name: Brady, Gerry
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Honestly, Professor Brady is the best professor I've ever had in Computer Science. The level of detail that she is able to break down a problem is absolutely incredible . Trust me when I say this, but you won't get a professor with that kind of diligence in CS ever. She provides foundations and inputs unique insights on how to solve a problem.
Dry lectures,covers standard material, no inspiration, bad attitude &amp; always grumpy.. just read her slides/notes from a classmate instead of attending.  It is quite easy to present math in a straightforward manner and still be clear like a textbook but she does nothing extra you can't read directly from a book
Algorithms is one of the hardest classes I've ever taken, and it's no understatement to say that I don't know how I would've made it through without Gerry Brady. She really cares about her students, and puts an enormous amount of effort into her lectures -- and it shows.
Gerry cares a lot about her students, but she is not a great teacher for this subject. She does not introduce topics with context, and distill the material into it's essential points. To put it another way lecture is like someone reading straight out of the textbook.  You're better off learning the material through videos online, much clearer.
Lots of people told me to just learn comp sci on my own - Gerry plays into that advice.  She does not add value as a professor.  Gerry's lectures are like reading out of a textbook.  She writes on the chalkboard for hours straight, missesrefuses to answer questions, and struggles to emphasize key points.  She doesn't distill jargon into wisdom.
Professor Brady is an incredible teacher. I had her this last quarter for algorithms, and am convinced she is the reason I enjoyed the subject so much. It was certainly difficult, but I felt that she made the material understandable. The only issue I took was her choice of TA - one of the TAs was excellent while the other was not as qualified.
Gerry is the best professor I have had in CSPP.  Her classes are challenging.  Homework are hard but that is how you learn. Tests are fair.  She uses the board a lot.  Make sure to take notes.
Very enthusiastic and helpful to her students. I loved the subject even more thanks to her style. I don't agree that her questions were too hard. She writes too much on the board though. I wish she uses PowerPoint more often.
Gerry is quite simply one of the very best professors I have ever had.  She will call on you of the blue and expect you to know the answer, which kept me very engaged in the class.
Algorithms is a difficult topic...I'm not sure I would have understood everything if it wasn't for Gerry.
Professor Brady's Algorithms course is difficult - as it should be.  It was an excellent experience and will push the average students to their best.
Gerry rocks.
A gem of a teacher, Professor Brady is professional and personable. She has obvious command of this subject and is interested in her students.
 The material is difficult, but in some measure the difficulty will depend on your background. In any event, Gerry Brady is the prof to cover this with. Even with my limited skills, I did well in her course.
Gerry is an amazing teacher - she explains difficult concepts in a patient and clear manner, is available to help students outside of class, and is inspirational in the breadth and depth of her knowledge of the topic.

He is an amazing professor, who really knows what he is talking about and who can truly reach out to his students and help them reach their potential.  Keep it up Jim
He is an awesome teacher, a brilliant man whose knowledge shows the students what they need to strive for, He can ramble a bit, but that makes him lovable and I couldn't stress about how much he loves what he does and the energy he brings to class is great! Keep it up Jim
Professor Veeneman seemed like a good teacher.  Very interesting the first day, but then class after class he started getting off topic.  Then students were faced with a midterm exam that everybody would have failed if not for a generous curve.  Teacher is somewhat arrogant and can not tolerate any dissenting opinions--should not be teaching!
Fun class, a little off topic at times; but I was happy with the overall quality of material. The prof is funny and passionate about the subject. He cares most about students learning the material.
The class was really relaxed, but I feel this was one of the strengths of the class.  The professor worked hard to reach the students, however class morale was low, making this a difficult task.  I woul definitely recommend this class to others because the professor is fun, has a real passion for the subject, and is genuinely concerned for students
I was VERY disappointed with this class.  I expected a lot more.  The professor seemed disorganized and it was never clear what we were supposed to cover in a given class.  Thus, I only got a fraction of what I could have out it.  I was definitely willing to work, but the prob sets felt like a waste because we often didn't have the tools to do them
I really enjoyed this course and learned so much in just 10 weeks. I wish SSA would offer this course in two parts one to focus on the Financial Statements and one to focus on budgeting. Great class!
Also would have liked to have stayed on track with the lecture slides. Nice that Prof wanted to connect with us in digressions, but that attempt at comraderie not important for my personal learning. Prob Sets ended up piling up b/c of time management; perhaps keep due dates for prob sets but add a TA session for those who need it.
The posted slides were a very helpful learning tool, although I wished we would have been able to stay more on target during class time.  Also, I appreciated Veeneman's enthusiasm and desire to challenge us as students (although some of my classmates expressed their malcontent over the expectations I thought his challenging was appropriate.)
Professor very accessible. Email &amp; office visits readily available to students and response to questions is quick. PowerPoint slides very good - synthesize necessary information. Sometimes homework questions did not appear in readings, which was challenging but solvable. Required time &amp; effort to master material. Was req course, so somewhat limited interest prior to start of quarter, but it proved to be very interesting &amp; valuable.
SSA needs more Veeneman. This class is a critical part of the curriculum at SSA and Veeneman adds tremendous value from years of experience. There is so much material that could be covered, I was frustrated by the rambling, unfocused classes-stay on task and make lectures more targeted and  efficient. The homework was extremely helpful.
This was on of the most interesting classes I've taken at U of C. His teaching style and personality combine dramatically! Too few professors case so much about the beauty and curiosity of learning. He engaged students and truly facilitated mutual learning. Jim is highly ethical and places high peformance standards on students
This was a class that you got out as much as you put in... a guided indep. study. It wasn't as organized as well as it could be, and the lectures felt like a Tony Robins seminar on the virtue of finance for NPOs.  However, I got a lot out of the class and would take him again.  Get organized and things would be excellent... tremendous potential.
Yes, the professor wasn't skilled at staying on point and getting a job done,  but was helpful in delivering messages that are critical to the work of non-profit management. More importantly, the SSA process for evaluation is far more useful than this and also should have been employed.
This is the worst class I have taken. His stories and unrelated comments took away from valuable learning time and wasted our tuition money. He is very intelligent but does not know how to pass on the knowledge. Class consists of him talking instead of teaching. I was disappointed in his lack of organization during each class and the quarter overal

Uncle Steve speaks very good English, and his class is extremely difficult. I took his class in 2004 (Cell Bio), and it is my honor to take his class. He got a Stanford MD/PhD!
He's a great teacher although he makes you really work for it. I could tell from the beginning he is very smart.
Hottie OMG, his criticizm was like water to a parched soul.
Biophysics - The best (and the hardest) class ever! It teaches you to live! And Kron is AMAZING
never lectured, but that was part of the point. he wanted us to do it on our own. he's a great motivator, and he would always help outside of class. he encouraged creativity, challenging authority, and cutting corners if it worked better than doing things by the book. steve taught us attitude, we taught ourselves bio. i liked the man.
KRON IS WONDERFUL! HIS BIOPHYSICS CLASS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!
very smart and interesting, but not human &amp; respectable. no nobel
cares deeply about his students.  the sour grapes folks should try a little harder to connect.  if you don't want a hard class, don't take an honors bio course!  wait til they get to biochem!
besides the one person (who wrote the four comments above, murazaka) every body in mol bio 2 likes steve besids his impecably lazy ways
This guy doesn't deserve the air it takes for him to exhale the biggest waste of lecture time I've ever been to.  If it were 100 years ago, this man would be tarred, feathered, and hanged.  One can only dream...
Kron was horrible. His lectures and notes for them couldn't have been more unclear and unhelpful. Furthermore, he kept reiterating how stupid we were because we couldn't understand the concepts through his jibberish.
Wait, Steve Kron *lectured*? Wow, that's a first. In Mol Bio 2, he did not teach at all, relying instead on his "TA's" who were students who took his class last year. Kron's job was, of course, to tell us from the first day how little we kne
uterly inchoherent jiberish, other than that he was succesful at confusing me
He's like James Joyce, only if he were a geneticist.  Completely full of himself and his lectures are streams of consciousness with no coherence whatsoever.

A very committed instructor to teaching with a deep love for maths. Highly competent with a desire to inculcate in learners life skills in problem solving and critical thinking
The Bollerman is the best teacher I have ever had. It's a hard class, but he made it so much fun and interesting, and was incredibly personal with his students and really helpful.

Teacher name: Butler, Laurie
School name: University of Chicago
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Prof. Butler is extremely knowledgeable about the course material. She is very tough, but it becomes apparent that it is only because she cares. She is kind and a great lecturer, so DO NOT SKIP CLASS. Warning though, psets are tough and tests tougher. But work hard and you'll be fine. (Made a solid 15 on a midterm, avg was 30, still pulled an A-)
Her assignments were long, and her exams tough, but that's because she expects a lot from her students. At first, she may appear unfriendly, but as soon as she sees that you're putting in the effort, she will go all out and guide you through the concepts in a way a textbook can not. Overall, and outstanding professor.
Clear lectures; friendly (though tough); knows the material like the back of her hand.
very thorough &amp; tough. homework takes forever &amp; tests are difficult, but students learn a lot
Not clear with math in physical chemistry, nor the practicality of quantum mechanics in the "big picture" of chemistry.  VERY wordy and did not explain concepts well.  Also a harsh grader.  Upper Division had a mean of about a C+ (you had to be above the mean to get a B)
She knows a great deal of physical chemistry theory, but is not clear in teaching and writes in a verbose manner.  This makes her courses especially difficult for anyone with problems in understaning it.  She also grades upper division classes with a mean of a C+/B- (you have to be in the 51st percentile or higher to even hope for a B).
She has huge expectations on what first year chemistry students can accomplish. Her type of teaching method is one reason those who have never taken chemistry before drop out quickly or fail.
She was harsh to the TA's, makes students feel insuperior, and she's a rough grader.
U of C Theoretical Professors should know math.
 She doesn't know math.  She also eats her hair when she is thinking, and most find that a gross turnoff.
horrible teacher, takes a bias towards the chem majors that know most of the info already, difficult problem sets that are ridiculous for a gen chem class (more appropriate for an Honors class), unreasonable with testing, grading, and communication is a problem.
Very disorganized, unclear, extremely difficult problems, quite unfair, biased towards the chem majors.... on the upside, she is a nice person outside the classroom.

Totally sweet. By the end of every class her ass was snow white from the chalk dust.
What an awesome professor, very down to earth and encourages her students to contact her and not her TA's with questions. Her lectures were clear, interesting and she actually made an effort to know all of her students by name. I took her class in 1999 and I still remember quantum mechanics.

Professor Archer has great lectures and a clear grading scale.
He is a very good and entertaining professor
Great prof!
Teaches material at level non-science students can understand. Looks just like Hugh Laurie from House M.D.
Very aloof. Not helpful to students. Travels too much.
He needs to be more approachable. It's like he lives in his own mind. Doesn't communicate.
He has the kindest eyes..
such a cute geek
Excellent professor. Clearly loves what he does.

Brilliant mind! Great teacher.
He makes the most difficult subject so easy. What a nice person.

Teacher name: Bar-On, Rann
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He talked too much about his personal opinions and tried to secretively mention them almost whenever he got a chance. I had no idea about his arrests until after I took his classes and I dont feel comfortable with someone so politically motivated teaching impressionable students.
I liked the class. He's a personable guy. He teaches for you to understand concepts more than just solving problems. Use the help room and study groups as well to more fully understand concepts and you'll do well in his class. You don't have to do textbook problems to pass. Make sure to do the handouts he gives in class.
Class is not easy but Professor Bar-On is not only a great lecturer, but more importantly, a genuinely awesome human being. I should have come to office hour more often!!
Professor Bar-On is easily one of the most caring professors at Duke. He really wants his students to succeed and is very accessible outside of class. The material is difficult, but he will do everything in his power to help you do your best. Take a class with him. It's so inspirational and special to have a professor who cares so much about you!!!
Rann is an amazing professor, the complete anti-stereotype to the typical Duke math professor. This class is obviously difficult, but Rann will make every effort to help you excell and was one of the most accessible teachers Ive had at Duke. Hes just a genuinely amazing guy! PS Take his labs!! You wont find anything like them again at Duke.
Duke should be so happy to have Rann. When you see someone with such passion for a subject you can't help but reciprocate. This has been my favorite class, and I really hope that I will have the privilege to take another math class with Rann before I graduate. The class is obviously difficult, but Rann made it a wonderful experience.
Really great guy in general. Material is tough, but he'll help you through it if you put in the effort.
He cares a lot about every student's success and is super reasonable if you talk to him. Really good lecturer and he takes as much time as he needs to answer clarifying questions.
Rann is a great math professor with a deep understanding of the material. Lectures are critical to understanding the material and Rann is always available and eager to help students. One of the most thoughtful and helpful teachers at Duke. Tests were reasonable, as well. This class isnt easy but if you reach out Rann will help you.
Professor Bar-on is fantastic  I wish hed teach other courses so Id have the chance to be his student again. His lectures are well-structured, the labs he designed are super fun (I really found great joy in them), and he is truly a cool and kind person. Helped me feel more confident in and appreciate Math! Not enough words but loved LA this sem!
Rann was one of my favorite professors at Duke so far. He truly cares about all of his students and wants to see us succeed. Math 218 is definitely not an easy class, but I think Rann did a great job with the course.
Rann is one of the most genuinely caring professors on this campus. He puts in a lot of effort to make himself accessible to students outside of class. Probably one of the sweetest and most intelligent people I've met in my life.
Professor Bar-on cares so much about his students. I thought this class was really difficult and math at Duke always will be but he made it a lot better by being funny, making mistakes himself and being an overall incredibly caring teacher
Simply a wonderful human being/genius. Can't think of any other lecturer that has cared so much about his students. Always takes feedback into account, and lectures are very clear. Very accessible outside of class if you have any questions. He also designed an optional lab component to this linear course that I would strongly recommend taking.
Best/toughest professor I've had
Rann is not only a math genius but also a friendly guy and a solid teacher. Midterms were hard-duh. Final was not as hard-thank the Lord. Most annoying thing about this class were written lab reports: his grading is very abstract. There's no rubric or clear criteria. He either loves or hates the report, which results in low lab grades.
Looks kinda like white Jesus, and he is a true math genius. If you have to take calc, take it with Rann!
Great Prof, really cares about his students and is there when you need him. Even when he had a baby on the way, he still made sure his students had what they needed to succeed!
Hes a tough grader but a really great guy. I was terrible at math and he was understandable. This class was a prerequisite but he knows the information, hes prepared and teaches calc pretty clearly
Rann is a great teacher. His class structure will not only help prepare you for this class, but other classes you may take as well. Usually accessible outside of class, and there are many chances to prove you know the material. The class is difficult, but if you stay engaged and on top of the coursework, it will make your experience much better.
Teacher name: Gustafson, Michael
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great professor who obviously cares about the students. I will reiterate the previous comments, that the books for the class are online, so you don't need to buy them. If you're coming in with previous programming experience, especially in Python this should be a pretty easy class. Just memorize the API and you're set.
EGR103 is a pretty easy class; if you want an A you'll get it. It's not a popular opinion, but I didn't like Dr. G at all. His lectures were incredibly dry, his jokes are canned and clearly rehearsed, and he just isn't a super genuine guy. The textbook is available online so don't buy it. The labs are time consuming but straight forward.
He really puts in a lot of effort into making the course extremely engaging. The class made me more interested in engineering than I already was. The tests are annoying because we have to essentially memorize API's, but other than that, the class is AWESOME!!!
Dr. G is the best prof I've had so far- he's a very fair grader and is super approachable. Textbook is online so dont buy it.
Dr. G does a very good job with this class. While sometimes the labs can take hours upon hours to complete, they are satisfying and applicable. They can touch on challenging math concepts, but Dr. G tries to explain all of them. Just make sure to study for the two midterms because they are 30% of your grade each.
Professor Gustafson is a great guy who genuinely cares about his students. If you have little programming experience he definitely tries to explain the basic concepts thoroughly and takes time each week to explain how to go about solving every problem on the lab/homework. The two midterms are definitely focused more on how well you know the syntax.
Dr. G is a great professor. He's very passionate and KNOWS what he's talking about. Unfortunately, this means that you're also expected to learn a lot of things that may or may not be tested. You come out of the class knowing the material very well but this may impact your GPA in doing so (HW is hard af). Try to take someone else for this class.
He is a good teacher, but the reality of the situation is that the vast majority of people giving this guy a 5 and rating the class with a 1-3 difficulty have prior coding experience. If you have good knowledge of coding (even in other areas) its easy. If you have no prior experience, it will take years to do the work. It's extremely difficult.
Dr. G is a funny guy with a great personality. His lectures are fast paced and sometimes not very helpful unless you actually reviewed the material beforehand. I didn't go to much of his lectures, but I could get by studying his homework (and reading the textbook). A lot of hwk! He has clear expectations on exams and is manageable
Very hard class with tons of homework, but Dr. G is there to help you out with it if you go to his lectures and office hours. He's also just a really nice guy.
I had Gustafson for EGR103, hated Matlab but loved the professor. Although he teaches a lot of other egr courses, he makes himself extremely available to students. I still wonder how he could fit so much into his schedule. He's a funny professor, pretty nerdy, but in a good way.
Dr. G is a good guy but his lectures aren't useful (usually never), I just study for exams doing the homework/reading the textbook. He's smart and quirky but if you want to really learn to do well in the class grade wise, you should try to study on your own. His office hours do help, however
Dr. G is the man. The course material was dry by nature but was a good lecturer considering that. Most of the learning comes through labs which are quite time-consuming but easy to get help with from TAs or Piazza. Getting a good grade is doable if you do the work. Overall extremely organized and dedicated to teaching.
People find him witty and like his humor - I get that. His lectures however, are incredibly fast paced and leave students lost towards the end. Walking out of lecture, most complain about how none of it made any sense. Homeworks are ridiculously time consuming, and will leave you frustrated.
Dr. G was easily accessible through Piazza. I had no prior coding before but it was still easy to end up with an A. The labs are difficult and time-consuming but just go to office hours and TAs will help you get a high grade. There were 3 major tests very similar to old tests and no final.
I greatly enjoyed my time as one of Dr. G's students. He goes out of his way to be accessible on Piazza and to make grading criteria as clear as possible. He also provides a ton of resources to help you through labs. While lectures weren't really necessary to attend, I found that the background info he provided was generally helpful in some way.
Dr. G is the teacher for the first year EGR class, and it's not too difficult if you have previous coding experience. Just turn in the labs on time (which can take a while), memorize a few lines of code needed for the tests, and you'll be fine. He's an okay lecturer, and very involved in the Engineering department at Duke.
Dr. G cares a lot about the success of his students and provides a ton of resources... take advantage of them and definitely go to office hours. The material can seem overwhelming at first, but everything in the class is manageable.
The only things tested was what was on labs, but the problem is the material in labs was never taught in class. While he is a very intelligent guy, every class consisted of an hour of some math you would never have to do again followed by him giving you one line of code that would do it all. Also, latex will be your best friend by the end :(
Dr. Gustafson is one of the better professors at Duke. Not only is he highly respected by other faculty members, but he is an amazing professor. His lectures are always filled with information (and are pretty fun to attend - he is a funny lecturer). Lab attendance is not necessary for unless explicitly required. I would highly recommend Dr. G!
Teacher name: Leachman, Lori
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Prof Lori is smart, but that does not mean she is a good teacher. She is often intimidating and sometimes disrespectful to students -- not a sustainable learning environment. Her grading is ambiguous and seems unfair. The material is hard, but her teaching style makes it harder. Take it elsewhere.
Very thorough, invested in your learning, you should go to lectures and pay attention to do well.
Most people go into her class expecting to be coddled and prodded along during the process of learning economics. But this is not the case and you will have to work hard. However, should you put in the effort you will be rewarded immensely. Highly caring and intelligent professor who rewards hard work.
Professor Leachman knows her stuff and is very invested in teaching the students who want to learn. If you put in the time to go to class and office hours, she will put in the time to help you understand the material. She was always willing to stop for questions and paused class after difficult material to ensure everyone was following her.
She is one of the most supporting teachers I have ever had. She makes an effort to get to know all her students, but get ready to study your ass off. The class is not curved, so the natural econ students get an A. Those who are not are screwed. Besides the difficult grading scale, it is an amazing class and highly advise taking it.
Professor Leachman, although portrayed by many as being really hard, is in actuality a great professor that really cares about her students. She is always available after class for questions and provides really good help before exams if you look for it. Tough class but enjoyable.
At first Leachman is definitely intimidating, but if you put in the effort and show up to office hours to ask meaningful questions she will like you.  This class was definitely tough, but I learned so so so much.  My biggest complaint about this class is the test grading.  I swear that the people who do really well are able to read Leachman's mind.
This is a hard class intended to weed out the people that aren't willing to work hard. The econ curriculum only gets more difficult from here. Lori is a great professor that really cares about her students. Even if you want to hate her because you're failing the tests, it's impossible. Go to her office hours, she will help you prepare for the tests
Professor Leachman is one of the least nice people I have ever met, and carries a clear bias in her teaching.  Tests have seemingly easy questions that are graded very harshly (taking of points without explanation). As much as I wanted to hate her, I have learned more taking this class than I have in any other class, it's truly amazing.
She's rough. Tests are stupid hard when the material isn't that tough. However, she does present the material clearly in lecture, although she does do it too quickly and expects you to pick it up like it's nothing. I recommend taking it with the other teacher. That being said, it's not the end of the world if you take it with her.
Her lectures are not clear, and her answers to students' questions are not helpful. She will often contradict herself from one lecture to another. Her exam questions are vague and harshly graded. Gives office hours, but she communicates terribly with the TAs so they are of little help. You will probably end up teaching yourself. Take elsewhere!!!
Her lectures are lengthy but helpful and she's pretty clear although her handwriting is basically illegible. Be prepared for lots of work and also don't miss lectures! They are extremely important.  She is definitely not that kind of amazingly nice professor and apparently doesn't care about what others think of her. Can be intimidating.
Avoid if you are not planning to be an ECON major. She is a terrible lecturer but its passable if you study hard for the tests and have a balanced schedule with this as a class. (Avoid the rattail)
Leachman creates an environment in the class that makes it difficult to learn. She is disrespectful to students. Her lectures are boring, and her handwriting is unclear. She never uses the textbook, and the only way to do well on tests is memorize her notes. Class isn't curved.
Don't bother buying the textbook for this class if you are taking it with her but I would recommend taking it with a different professor. She teaches well if you have already taking AP Econ, but otherwise a lot of studying is required. I recommend taking it with another professor. She is very blunt and doesn't care what people think about her.
lecture is very conceptual/broad, but her exams are very specific, never uses the textbook, not worth buying, illegible handwriting on her lecture notes
This class is hard. Don't buy the textbook. You will never use it. Lori seems like a cool person but is not great as a teacher because there is no curve and tests are hard to prepare for.
Oh Lori. Memorize her lectures to do well on the exams. I wish I had gone to her office hours more often because she actually was helpful. She's a pretty interesting person, don't be intimidated by her. Also, she does NOT curve at all. Overall it was a decent class, not easy but not too difficult either.
Leachman is an unfair teacher who makes an otherwise interesting and easy subject miserable.
Overall a rather terrible professor. The tests reflect your ability to understand her strange mentality and logic over economic principals and theory. She strongly pushes her opinions as fact and is unhelpful and often flat out rude to students who seek her help. (Her handwriting in the notes is also illegible)
Teacher name: Bray, Clark
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I strongly dislike his teaching style -- he makes video pre-lectures that you have to watch before class, and doesn't really lecture during class, but just answers questions. It makes class boring and slow, and it makes the material harder to understand. On top of that, he still requires attendance in lectures.
objectively the best teacher for multi. if you put the effort in and are decent at math, you will get an A, because he puts up every past exam ever on his website and he also writes the final exam. I did every past exam he posted and ended up finding the assessments very easy. tldr; take multi with him and do the past exams!!!
Definitely the best professor you can have for multi! His class is challenging and you'll constantly feel behind, but he prepares you well for the final. Loves the math and "geometric intuition" behind everything and incredibly smart!
Multi is definitely a tough class no matter what, but Bray does a great job explaining these concepts. Tough but rewarding. Tests are fair if you understand the concepts and look over a few of his past tests. Also, he is one of very few in the department who have taught multi for years making him a great resource
Dr. Bray is the sole beacon of light within a sinking Duke Math department. Actually learned something as he surprisingly seems to be interested in teaching students, a rare find within the department. If you have to take a math class, take it with him. Will undoubtedly be inspiring.
God
Very tough class and not very clear when he's lecturing whether it's actual material or just a tangent. A nice guy during office hours.
Bray is a really good professor, and the only professor for Math 216. His lectures are very detailed, and he does a pretty good job of explaining in class. Be prepared for lecture, especially during the first half of the course, which is flipped. Don't fall behind either, and start on the (sometimes lengthy) homework early.
Dr. Bray is wonderfully in lectures -- he does a great job of reiterating key principles and explaining concepts intuitively, rather than asking us to simply memorize material. The classroom environment is also generally welcoming!
If you are expecting a class with little homework, then you have a fundamental misunderstanding of mathematics. You should feel shocked if a math professor fails to assign practice problems. No homework is morally equivalent to phooey.
Bray is a nice person. However, his class is very mechanical. During his lectures, he usually reads and circles his lecture notes. In order to achieve a high score, the best way is to do all his past papers. At the end of the day, some people memorized the tricks to do problems while failed to understand the essence of linear algebra.
Talk extremely slow. Force students to learn everything before class and repeat the online material in class. Lots of homework.
Bray is a fantastic teacher for multi, and his office hours are particularly useful. The practice exams are helpful, and the tests are fair. Multi is a pretty dry and boring class, but Bray does a good job explaining it. Watch out for some of his catchphrases such as "geometric intuition," "morally equivalent," and "convince yourself that__."
Assumes mastery of Greens and Stokes, or any material that is morally equivalent.
Clark Bray is a difficult teacher. There is no way around it. However, he is by far the best teacher for math 212. You will feel like you are struggling compared to peers in other classes but the way the overall bell curve is used, Bray's students end up doing the best. He teaches the material super well and sets you up for success on the final
Clark Bray is the worst teacher in the worst. He is an automaton. A complete robot. His method of teaching really didn't work for me. He is obsessed with proofs and doesn't seem to understand that most of us just want to learn what we need to, and not get lost in the disgusting world of mathematical proofs.
Excellent lecturer. Very clear and precise. Easy to understand and engaging. Knows how to anticipate and address questions about the material. Definitely don't shy away from taking this class. The material can get dry but he knows how to teach it.
I am not a big fan of Clark Bray, but he does give you everything you need to get a good grade. If you just do all of his practice tests then you will know exactly what to expect on the exam and can get an A. I do not think he is very good at connecting with students and is not very good at explaining difficult concepts.
His class was very well structured and easy to follow, though the material was difficult.  You knew what to expect in class and how to prepare for tests.  Lectures could sometimes get tedious, but I appreciated his efforts to lay the proper foundation for new material before moving on.
One of the worst math instructors I've had. His lectures consist of him annotating his lecture notes while basically reading the notes, which is pretty useless. He does record the lectures, but requires attendance. He comes across as inaccessible and self centered. He clearly thinks that his approach to math is the best one, and is definitely wrong
Teacher name: Fullenkamp, Connel
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
In this class you will learn only a new appreciation of pain
His class is very work intensive and can be demotivating, but you'll learn a lot and get a refresher on world news. Hard class but definitely not impossible.
Fullenkamp's great professor who really cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. If you're taking 101 take it with him. Lots of worked b/c of flipped classroom, but you will learn a ton of useful econ. Tests are hard and everyone fails but just do better than everyone else. The 2 weeks off in October is nice. Go to TA office hours!
Professor Fullenkamp is a very intelligent individual, but he can expect too much of his students, especially for a 101 course. The workload is immense since it is a flipped classroom, and the problem sets consume a lot of time. Classes are spent doing problems instead of teaching. Overall, it is a very demanding class, but definitely worth taking.
Fullenkamp is a great professor and is excellent at teaching economics. The class demands a lot but it is very worth it.
Fullenkamp is honestly brilliant. The man will teach you a ton about Econ. However, be prepared to work. Nothing is easy in this class and everything is earned. Write down formulas and buzzwords for the Midterms and Finals and go to his TA Office Hours for the problem sets.
Fullenkamp will make you know economics, but it might be at the expense of your GPA and dignity. Lecture can be rather intimidating: 250+ students in an auditorium, and not an actual lecture but practicing problems where you'll be called on to present in front of the entire class. It's a flipped class - you watch 90+ min of videos for each class
expects a lot but it's only because he's a genius and really wants his students to understand the material. grades are completely based on where you fall on the curve.
Very hard, very long tests.
This is an amazing class and you learn a lot of concepts in it, but you must be ready to work. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE NOT GENUINELY INTERESTED IN ECONOMICS. You will want to cry. So much information crammed into really hard midterms. No one passes and there's a huge curve. Totally recommended if you are actually interested in the topic.
Very entertaining lecturer. You will learn a ton about econ and how to think in an economic sense. Also will force you to read the WSJ and stay up to date with the news. Tests were kind of ambiguous but if you correctly use buzzwords and FINISH the test you should be fine. Great intro course teacher
Probably the hardest class ever taken at Duke, but learned a ton about econ. His class is so very different from others because he doesn't teach based on textbooks. He uses real-world news articles as class materials and asks us to analyze them with economics models. Definitely watch all videos. Go to class and do all problems he gives.
Fullenkamp is absolutely hilarious. He makes classes interesting. He also takes the time to get to know his students even though it's a large introductory lecture. This class isn't as hard as people make it out to be but it's still difficult. I would not recommend it unless you are considering becoming an econ major.
Dr. Fullenkamp's brilliant way of teaching economics will make you THINK in a completely different way. He is accessible and always happy to help - but don't waste his time with silly questions about the problem sets. It's a time-consuming class, but worth every second. Yow, you are getting the best returns on your investment if you take his class
Professor Fullenkamp is one of the coolest people at Duke. He can easily see through bs so don't try to tell him you actually enjoy economics if you just want to be an investment banker. You can tell he really cares about his students because he holds office hours twice a week, unlike most high ranking professors. Take this class for sure!!!
This is not only the best class I took in this semester, but during my whole bachelor (Senior). Fullenkamp makes the difference. He's always ready to teach. He introduces the topics in a very approachable way. With real world examples, it's easy to see how useful this class is. The weekly workload allows you to stay on top of the material. 10/10
Most complained about course at Duke. Not sure why he makes it so hard. It was a struggle. I do not know many people who received A's in the course.
Smartest and most entertaining economics professor at Duke. Defiantly worth taking any class he teaches so long as you are actually interested in understanding the subject and willing to put in the time. Can be a bit intimidating but really does mean well.
Fullenkamp's class is very much application based. In our flipped class, we watched videos of him teaching the concepts and then spent class time discussing problems. He would give us WSJ articles to read and we would analyze them together in class. Really grounds these abstract economics concepts and helps you work through them.
Professor Fullenkamp once leaned over to pick something up and I was met with his  bald, knowledge-packed head 3 inches from my face. It was a spiritual revelation.  He's also brilliant, hilarious, and designs lectures to make you truly THINK. It's one of the most educating classes at Duke, but prepare to WORK for it!
Teacher name: Glass, Alex
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
This class is definitely not easy as people say it is. He speaks extremely quickly which does not allow you to write down everything he says. His exams test you on the most insignificant parts of his lectures. I would not recommend taking this course.
not necessarily the easy a it used to be. tests almost exclusively assess the most insignificant of facts rather than concepts taught in class.
Alex Glass has to be one of my favorite professors at Duke. He is very passionate about geology/ bio-geology, and from this, he knows a lot about the relation of these topics to those of human history and interaction. If you allow yourself to see and understand his passions, you will learn a LOT. Take a class with him, and do so with an open mind!
He was a good lecturer and the class had some interesting parts, but some parts were boring because they were too specific. His slides didn't have much information so you have to go to class and pay attention. Average grade was a B. Negatives were him missing some classes and he said he would post grades that night but then posted a week later.
He is a good lecturer. Just pay attention during lectures and take good notes No homework. The final paper is easy because you basically get the entire semester to work on it.
To be successful in his class, all you have to do is show up to lectures and pay close attention. Also, be sure to diligently study for exams. This course is rather straightforward if you take it seriously. Glass is rather interesting about 70% of the time but the other 30% can be hard to stay awake.
Alex is super funny and a GREAT lecturer. He is very unorganized but it didn't really bother me. Everybody takes Rocks as a joke NS class, but is NOT as easy as it is made out to be. I made the mistake of only going to class a couple of times for the first test. Didn't work out and the first test made it impossible for me to get an A. GO TO CLASS!!
Prof Glass is fantastic and I loved his oceans class. I'm premed so I didn't have to take his class for any credit, but I'm glad that I did. That being said, don't go in assuming the course is going to be easy. You definitely have to go to lecture and take great notes, but he makes it a ton of fun and lecture is never boring.
No work for this class except the tests and one paper. TESTS ARE HARD. Write down everything he says in class!
Amazing lecturer, very funny, slides don't have many words so  you have to process the information and take good notes, exams are the only difficult part but you can do well if you study
EOS 101 is definitely not as easy as people make it out to be. Rocks for Jocks? more like Rocks for Geniuses. The material is boring, but Glass does what he can to make it interesting. Funny guy. Tests are multiple choice but are quite difficult, anything he's ever said in lecture, even in passing, is fair game. Don't skip lecture.
Prof. Glass is an awesome professor. Even if you don't find the subject particularly interesting on its own, you will with him. The class wasn't too difficult but don't go in expecting it to be easy. You definitely need to pay attention during lectures and constantly take notes. The exams are pretty tricky even though they're multiple choice.
Glass is the man - he's a funny, friendly guy with amazing Powerpoints and interesting lectures. Dynamic Earth is NOT easy. Not that hard either, but test writing makes things tougher. EOS 101 definitely wasn't the joke I expected. Pulled all-nighters for the midterms, ended up with a 91 and missed an A by two test questions, but heck, my fault...
I heard this class was easy but it really wasn't. There are only a couple of tests and one paper. Tests are pretty difficult and it's not easy to do well in the class if you don't ace everything. Overall, not a bad class but don't underestimate the amount of studying you need to do in order to make an A.
This was an interesting class, and Dr. Glass is a hilarious professor. However, this class is definitely not an easy A. It is possible if you work hard, but the tests are extremely specific making it impossible to do well if you don't really know the material. I recommend this class only if you're ready to do work even when it's not "assigned".
Glass is geeky adorable and a fantastic lecturer - I really learned a lot in his course and he is entertaining and creates spot-on Powerpoints. I went in to this class believing the "Waves for Babes" reputation and expecting an easy A, but I studied really hard to end up with a B. Take the first test very seriously, that's where I went wrong.
Great professor with great lectures. Barely any out of class work but the tests are very difficult. Be prepared to study a lot for them and don't expect an A.
EOS 102 is an interesting class. Alex Glass is a great professor and his powerpoints are the best i've seen in all my life. However, many people drop after the first midterm, only 20% or so get an A and the rest will get Bs and Cs. If you love to memorize information you will not likely use after the class (unless you major in EOS), take this class
Professor Glass is hilarious. Tests are a bit tough so make sure to study the fine details. I would definitely take him again.
Professor Glass is excellent in clarity and conciseness, so long as you attend class. I took this class thinking it would be an easy A and while I got the outcome I wanted, I studied hard for the tests. If you do not show up to class, there will be questions that he only gives information for in person or over audio (and I wouldn't count on audio).
Teacher name: MacPhail, Richard
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He Is a nice, very accessible teacher. He makes an effort to help the students and clarify the tough concepts. Chemistry is confusing in and of itself, and the fact that it's a flipped class makes the course harder, but he tries to help the students and he is fair.
McPhail's lectures are confusing, at least for me (my class was reversed classroom). Better to skip the lecture and read the book, paying attention to the small rules and quirks about topics. Attendance for the applications is required if you want to pass. The tests are pretty tricky too, but if you take SAGE and go into office hours, you'll be ok.
His lectures were very ehh. He doesn't make things as clear as Roy does, but that may be because his chapters for the class made less sense to me in general. He's a very nice teacher though and is very available outside of class.
he teaches the more math-y parts of chem 101, so his lectures are inherently a little painstaking to listen to. but he drops in some jokes and i think he makes an actual effort to make the lectures and class enjoyable. :-)
Not as great a lecturer as Roy, and his handwriting on the chalkboard is hard to read. He writes easier exams than Roy, but you still have to read the textbook if you want to have any idea what's going on in class.
For me, reading the textbook before class was a must. I got the most out of MacPhail's lectures by taking notes beforehand and then just listening to him talk and watching him do examples. His exam questions are pretty straightforward, but make sure you can reliably do computations so as not to lose easy points.
His lectures are fine. I preferred just reading the textbook and doing the unit plan. He was nice and accessible outside of class
Professor MacPhail is my favorite professor I've ever had. His name may be MacPhail but if you think hard about chemistry then you will DEF McPass this class!!
Dr. MacPhail is so responsible. His lectures can get intense, and maybe boring for other students, but they're great for anyone who actually cares about chemistry. He clearly loves his subject and is always willing to explain confusion outside of class. Friendly man, great class. Take it if you care about Chem.
Never fear, you can MacPass in Dr MacPhails class if you put in the effort. I actually preferred him over Roy. Hes to the point, but maintains a sense of humor. He has long hippie hair, probably because he went to Oberlin, but dont let that fool you. Hes a smart man.
Doctor Richard MacPhail made me a better person
Not a particularly good lecturer, especially compared with Roy. He definitely writes easier exams than Roy, but lecture was not helpful.
Dr. MacPhail sometimes co-teaches the class with Dr. Roy, which can be a bit confusing because their teaching styles differ. He gives you examples instead of explaining what's happening and why.  The tests are difficult and the Sapling doesn't help much. The labs were simple most of the time and didn't really have anything to do with the lecture.
Dr. MacPhail oversaw this lab course, and he graded some of the writing assignments. Grading criteria were somewhat clear, but could have been clearer.
Literally the least helpful professor I have ever taken a class with. He makes me angry. I almost regret my choice of college because of this man.
Dr. MacPhail is a really smart guy; however, he moves very fast and lectures are usually hard to follow. I enjoyed Roy more. MacPhail just does not seem to understand that some students do not know the material and need actual explanation. He is a pretty nice guy, but I would definitely read the textbook before class.
Professor MacPhail explains concepts clearly and is extremely helpful during office hours. All around great guy. Highly recommend as a professor.
Great guy, very smart. Too smart for me at least. I couldn't keep up. I ended up skipping class and reading the textbook and working ALL the suggested problems to stay afloat in this class. labs and discussion saved my grade. The exams are super hard. Don't depend on lectures alone to prepare you.
Horrible lecturer. He knows what he's talking about but he doesn't make it clear to you.
Doesn't tell you what you need to know. Lectures are useless, no exceptions.
Teacher name: Roy, Christopher
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
If you do poorly on the 3 exams/finals, you will fail this class. That being said, just study for the exams and you should be fine. The exam questions are fairly straight forward from lecture and discussion questions. Lectures are dull, but go to get notes. The textbook is totally useless.
Professor Roy is a really charismatic and knowledgable lecturer. While he could be a little condescending at times, he genuinely tried to help students succeed. He gave very fair midterms that tested understanding of the material and would even clarify things during exams to help you do your best.
Going to class is not mandatory or needed - unless you feel like you learn better in the lecture setting, you will not be left behind if you read the textbook yourself because that's pretty much what he does in lecture. Nothing especially hard, just chem101, study the material and you will do well. If not, it will be tough.
I mostly skipped lecture and just relied on AP Chem knowledge plus the textbook/exercises, but when I was in class he was clearly quite the public speaker--he went a bit too slow sometimes in my opinion, but otherwise is definitely a really knowledgeable and generally friendly guy. There are times when he loses his patience, but rare.
He is a very engaging lecturer and easy-going. I got to know him during my time at the Marine-lab and since then all the feedback I've heard from friends taking his class was that "He made chem so much easier than I thought." I took his CHEM101 this semester (not finished) but he is definitely an approachable, engaging, and devoted lecturer.
I really don't understand why they have us copying 3 pages of 1.25 spaced procedures into a lab notebook by hand before every lab. This is unnecessary, childish, and tedious, not to mention a complete waste of time and effort. This class is good, but lab really, really sucks.
Dr. Roy is great. Very enthusiastic lecturer and very well put-together. The material can be dense, but he does a great job explaining it and his lectures are very organized. Very accessible outside of class. My only regret is that I can't take Orgo with him
Absolutely amazing. His lectures are enjoyable and interesting. I really think this man deserves a reward for how great he is. Highly Highly Highly recommend taking his class.
I really disliked his style of lecturing. He often went off topic and did not focus on the material that we were tested on. His tests were extremely difficult and the wording was sometimes confusing.
I had Roy for the first half of CHEM101 and Macphail for the second half. Roy is definitely more clear with his language. He's very available outside of class, and offers study sessions before midterms. I'd recommend reading the textbook chapters for this class because it makes things more clear. Definitely take the labs and discussions seriously.
Dr. Roy is a great lecturer; he uses his projected iPad screen for lecture so it's easy to take notes, and he keeps lectures interesting and funny. I highly recommend him, but you still have to study and read the textbook if you want to be proficient in chemistry.
His humor is meh. Kind of gets in the way of lectures, and he only explains concepts and topics at the surface level. This class is just fine if you had a solid AP Chem. teacher. If you do not have an AP Chem background, find students to help you because Roy and MacPhail's lectures will not adequately prepare you for exams. Textbook is great-use it
I enjoyed Roy's lectures - his jokes helped lessen the dryness of the material, and he explained concepts clearly. He was enthusiastic and made chemistry about as palatable as it could be. The lectures followed the textbook pretty closely. His exams are fair assessments of your understanding, and he'll give you points back on a regrade if deserved.
Roy is very engaging during his lectures and tries to make chemistry as interesting as possible. If you skip lectures, definitely read the textbook. Roy has a cute dog too.
Dr. Roy is an enthusiastic lecturer whose energy can lead you through a content heavy class. Even so, all the information comes rapid-fire fast. Even during office hours, his responses can come far faster than your questions. A very cool man who's flunched often, but he moves quickly.
Great guy, very engaging and enthusiastic.
Though I hadn't taken chemistry since 10th grade, this class was not very difficult. Since the lecture notes are posted online and the textbook is fantastic (uses clear, basic language and easily explains tough concepts) attending lecture isn't necessary (though Roy is great). Labs and online HWs are annoying and can take up a good amount of time.
Dr. Roy sometimes co-teaches the class with Dr. MacPhail, which can be a bit confusing because their teaching styles differ. He's funny and knowledgeable, and tells you why something is happening.  The tests are difficult and the Sapling doesn't help much. The labs were simple most of the time and didn't really have anything to do with the lecture.
Chem101 was a fine class, a prereq that I'd never have taken otherwise, but ok. Roy was a good lecturer, has passion for sure and cracks a few jokes. But attending lecture and reading the textbook isn't enough. The tests have a lot of math-y FRQ, so know the difference between understanding what you read and being able to do problems. Do Sapling.
Professor Roy brought enthusiasm to Chem 101, and taught the criteria clearly. There is some homework and tests are definitely difficult, but if you spend a lot of time studying and doing practice problems you will be fine.
Teacher name: Astrachan, Owen
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
compsci 201 with him is the best. very fair and reasonable assessments, relatively organized for such a large class. learned a lot. great preparation for technical interviews. so glad I got to take it with him!
Lectures lack in substance, about 1/3rd of the lecture is actually useful, but by the time he gets there, you're tuned out. The assignments are pretty straightforward but seem kind of pointless. The APTs, however, are extremely useful. This class is very difficult for those without much prior experience in CS, but is v useful and rewarding.
Astrachan's lectures were entertaining and generally helpful. He is sometimes disorganized, but not to the point that it causes major stress or impacts your grade. There's a decent amount of work, but if you get it all done you will likely get at least an A-. Overall, I learned a lot without too much stress - definitely recommend him for CS 201.
Be ready for a gigantic class. The lecture was pretty disorganized but very funny (ola really tries to get the attention of the class). Tests are super easy with an A- median. CS201 is a good intro class to Compsci. It is not super necessary to take CS101 ahead of this even if you haven't had AP CS
Interesting, funny guy. Class is huge (300+) so can be hard to pay attention but he tries to make it interesting and lectures available online. Gives you a solid foundation of Java and made me want to take more compsci. Throws a ton of free points at you and assignments/tests aren't too tough - median grade is an A-. Is pretty disorganized though
Professor Astrachan is a great professor for 201 really cementing these comp sci topics in your head. The class is very project and test based, but the tests and projects are fair. My only critique with this class would be that at times, disorganized.
So many things to do  neverending!! but lectures are great and the UTAs are fantastic. They make all the difference
Great professor! A bit disorganized, but he is a master of the material and really knows how to teach.
Astrachan is a great lecturer and this class was fun! I would often look forward going to class. Work is not too difficult but expect to spend a fair amount of time on the class. One complaint is that we never got feedback on our assignments, but everything ended up working out in the end. Would recommend him as a professor overall though!
Keep up with all the assignments, go to lab, do the WOTOs, and GO TO OFFICE HOURS IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS! Lectures are streamed online, which is a definite plus. I bombed two of the exams and I suck pretty badly at CS but still somehow managed to walk away with an A-... THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR REDEMPTION IN THIS CLASS. All hail Ola.
Absolutely loved his class! He really makes his lectures fun!
This guy is an unclear lecturer. He is also pretty disorganized. CS201 was one of the worst classes that I've taken at Duke so far. The due dates were always up in the air, you don't really know how you're doing in the class until the end of the semester, and he doesn't really emphasize important points in lectures.
Astrachan is really the best lecturer I have encountered so far. Not only is he super hilarious (at least during lectures), but he is able to explain difficult concepts in an amazingly clear and interesting manner. The quality and depth of his lectures have also improved from previous semesters. You should get an A if you work reasonably hard.
Prof. Astrachan is a great lecturer, but taking a seminar with him was awful. He did very little to help mediate discussion, and sometimes it felt like he hadn't even read the articles he assigned. He only graded two of our many assignments, and he regularly missed meetings scheduled with students. He was also rude to some of the students in class.
It was hard in the beginning to adjust from Python to Java if you came from 101. Projects were confusing and there was a lot of homework, whether it was projects or APTs. Luckily the APT solutions were posted. Tests weren't too bad and they made the higher midterm grade your total midterm grade.
Astrachan is a great lecturer, but can't do seminars. What you need for a good seminar -- communication, feedback, guided discussions -- are Astrachan's weaknesses. He frequently talks over students and seems to prefer refuting things we say rather than helping us actually learn. The upside is, since he's so disorganized, the class is really easy.
Good lecturer but really bad on turning assignments back to students in a timely manner
Astrachan, overall, is a pretty funny and nice guy. However, I don't think he's the best professor, contrary to what people said in previous years. At least my year, grading was quite slow and I felt as if the lectures in the class were disorganized. However, I do think that if you put in effort, you will learn quite a lot in an important CS class!
Had no java experience to start but got full credit on APTs and assignments because of help hours. Can be hard to focus during his lectures, but they're recorded so watching them was very useful. Astrachan was disorganized the whole semester. Got brutalized on the first test and didn't do well on the second but a good final can make up for it.
Best professor ever! Take his class even if you hate compsci. I do, and it was still a great experience :)
Teacher name: Baldwin, Steven
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Yes orgo is hard, but Baldwin is very fair and really wants you to do well. His hour exams were difficult, but there were no surprises. The final is considerably harder than the hour exams. I found that lecture wasn't as helpful as just reading the textbook and working practice problems, of which he provides plenty. He tries to make you laugh.
Extremely extremely hard course but Baldwin makes it better by throwing hilarious jokes in the middle of his lectures. Def have to work for it, but his midterms are just like the past hour exams so study those really well. Lots of hours need to be put in outside of class to really understand the material but very rewarding in the end.
Dr. Baldwin was an amazing professor who somehow made Orgo an enjoyable experience. Like the previous reviewer attested, he hands out extremely fair examinations. Do his old hour exams that he posts, as those tend to reflect the styles of questions that'll appear on your exams. The final is essentially an amalgamation of his hour exams but harder.
This man is a gem of a professor: amazing teacher, hilarious, and gives VERY fair exams based on material. Would recommend taking notes before class and going to lecture to just learn the material you need for the exams. Overall, makes orgo an enjoyable experience.
Absolutely amazing professor. Lectures on the important information from the book and adds some of his own information not from the book so 100% go to lecture. He tries to help his students to the best of his ability inside and outside of class and is extremely intelligent. Tests were very fair although hard and requires a thorough comprehension.
Know how to do every single problem in his practice exams and you will be fine. Also summer orgo1 is objectively the move.
Just go to class and take notes. He's a great lecturer and tests what he goes over in class. Every orgo 1/2 class is hard people, no professor is gonna be easy cuz orgo is just plain hard. You want Baldwin for either orgo - his exams are very predictable just like is past exams so do those! Class curved so mean is B and above mean is A
I had a rough semester but nonetheless this class and this professor are very tough. I think Baldwin is a fine professor and gives decent lectures, but I found him very unhelpful outside of class and he expects a lot of you. I recommend getting a tutor and being ready to read and learn outside his classroom.
Baldwin is one of the better orgo 1 professors at Duke. His lectures can be a little dry and it's easy to get lost, but once you read the chapters and actually understand the material, you realize that his lectures are very thorough and he focuses on what he will test you on. Tests can definitely be tricky, but I think he is a fair professor.
Baldwin is an awesome professor. He's got a great dry sense of humor and he makes sure to keep students informed about test scores and curves. Would definitely take a class with him again.
If youre taking orgo, this is the prof you wanna take it w/. Hes really funny and thus keeps students engaged during lecture, despite how dry the material is. His three hour exams are 100% fair. The last two are challenging, but everything on there is stuff that he went over in class - no surprises. He made orgo 20x less miserable.
So much fun to listen to in lecture. You should attend every lecture and take super good notes to pass the hour exams--definitely take advantage of the vintage hour exams when studying.
A very firm but very fair class. Unlike some chem 201 professors, there are absolutely no "gotcha" style problems that intend to trip up students. He cracks joke during lectures and makes them pretty worth your time. That being said this class is all about independent study so make sure NOT to put if off until the night before.
Professor Baldwin is a great professor. Orgo is super hard, but he makes it manageable. READ THE TEXTBOOK. That's a must. Also, go to recitation--it's super helpful. If your TA isn't helpful, just go to one that is.
Orgo is hard. There's no other way to put it. No matter how amazing of a professor Dr. Baldwin is, some people just aren't meant for orgo. Make sure to do the problem sets and read the textbook before the tests. 10/10 go to office hours just to talk to Baldwin because he is awesome even though the subject matter is not.
Baldwin made orgo way easier than it could have been, but it was still VERY hard. Lecture is mostly examples, not instruction, so reading the textbook is very necessary if you want to do well. Funny professor, 10/10 would recommend.
I took orgo 2 with baldwin and it was surprisingly not bad. His lectures are clear and he's always willing to help outside of class.
I loved Baldwin.  I hated Orgo 1 with Canelas, but actually really liked Orgo 2 with Baldwin.  He writes everything on the chalkboard so it's really easy to follow along.  I recommend going to the weekly CMA Orgo sessions because they are way more helpful than Baldwin's Review sessions.  Studied really hard and did well.
Dr. Baldwin is one of the best professors at Duke. His lecture can be a bit dull, but he has a great sense of humor. He is also very clear and a fair grader (most people got points back on regrades). His midterms are fairly straightforward if you do the practice tests, but beware, that man sure does know how to write a tough final.
He's a great teacher just be sure to study hard. Nothing at Duke is especially easy but if you prepare for orgo 2 you will be ready for the tests. Also make sure you do the practice tests so many times hat you memorize how to do those problems
Teacher name: Rodger, Susan
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
CompSci 94 is supposed to be easy but Professor Rodger makes it so difficult to learn anything. She is not open to any questions or helping any students, her TA's do a better job at teaching than she des. Do not take this class if you're looking for an easy A or to learn anything useful about computer science.
Absolutely horrible professor. Was abrasive to questions, and when she did take them usually answered them rudely. Sometimes had 4 or more things due in one week with a midterm on the way. Clearly doesn't care about her students. Avoid at all costs.
Professor Rodger strikes me as someone who understands the material very well herself, but has a tough time imparting that to others. In short, a lot of the learning in her computer science classes has to be done on your own.
Rodger is really sweet and cares about her students, but isn't a great lecturer. I came in having zero CS background and was fine. The workload is extremely heavy in this class with nonstop assignments, but eventually you begin to get efficient at it. The tests, however, are extremely easy and are identical to previous years which are available
I underestimated the class... it was one of the most work intensive classes from my last semester. Be ready to work really really hard and be on top of your things even though I knew some python before coming in
Had no coding exp. but am math-sci guy. HUGE workload, but having old exams (easy to master) made class not too bad. I spent many hours with TAs, but do APTs and cool assignments, GET HELP, and you'll do fine. Lectures mostly tips, not teaching, but try attending. TAs are amazing, helpful. Most find 101 very easy or hard, depends on aptitude for CS
For a humanities major looking for a QS requirement, this was a very difficult class. The homework was never ending; once an assignment was completed after an all-nighter, another one appeared. Lectures didn't really help. It was trial by error, with a ton of error. I got a higher grade than I actually felt like I deserved, thankfully.
Dr. Rodger is a fine and boring person. Her lectures are very dull. I don't think she did a great job in teaching the class, however if you are a math and science person it will likely be an easy A. I came into the class already knowing python, and if you've had prior coding, it will be very easy.
This is a very time-intensive class (101) and there are so many reading quizzes/ assignments. Professor Rodger is very nice and aims to make the class enjoyable. However, I found that I was not able to understand concepts unless I self-studied from the online textbook. I was a bit bored sometimes, too but maybe that's because I didn't put in work.
Rodger really does try to be helpful to her students. There are a lot of resources to do well. What she often lacks is proper organization so that students can find helpful information. Lectures not necessary to attend, but are helpful. Readings necessary. Do the homework and do it well. You'll be fine.
This class was a lot of work, but python is relatively easy and I enjoyed putting in the time to complete assignments. Did not pay attention to a word Susan said, only went to class to fulfill in class participation assignments, just read the super-helpful textbook and passed. Overall pretty good class and the best option to fulfill that QS.
Great teacher!
Sweet lady, but lectures are painful. There is a lot of work in this class, and I honestly don't know how people who didn't go to office hours passed. This class is an easy A if you're a compsci person, but if you're not, it's really difficult.
Lectures are a  bit dry and recap the readings. Lecture slides are posted online but attendance is mandatory. Very assignment heavy class: weekly quizzes, assignments, APTs and labs. Stay on top of workload and you'll be ok - don't procrastinate. Rodger and TAs have lots of office hours and are very willing to help. Definitely take if interested.
Prepare to be lured, swept away, and absolutely enraptured by the arms of sleep. So skip lectures since you won't stay awake anyways.  Prepare to invest time on assignments (harder ones take 5+ hrs). CS101 is polarizing; people find it easy or hard without many in between, so experience it yourself.
Rodger gets a bad rep, but really isn't that bad and 101 is an easy A
Professor Rodger was tried hard to make lectures interactive, but they were boring at times. Lots of work, although not too hard and I learned a lot. Professor Rodger is also just a really nice person, she really wants her students to like Computer Science, and made us cookies and fudge sometimes!
This class is NOT easy - you can get an A, but be prepared to do tons of busy work. Go to office hours w/ TAs religiously. Lectures are pointless - no one pays attention, but there are attendance points. APTS, Assignments, RQ, etc. - tons of assignments, you'll have several hours of work per week. However, I legitimately enjoy coding which is nice.
Professor Rodger is brilliant and quirky, but her class is a pain. I've never taken computer science before so it was very difficult. She teaches Python in 101. I found to give myself 4 days to do an assignment, and 3 days to do an APT, and to do the readings as soon as possible. GO TO HELP HOURS AT NIGHT THE TAs ARE SO HELPFUL.
This class is soooooo easy.  Recommend for anyone who can remotely handle a course that is not in the humanities.
Teacher name: Byerly, Ingrid
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Easily one of the best professors I've had at Duke. Would strongly recommend. You get what you put into the class and most of your grade is based on the portfolio and your participation in lectures.
Professor Byerly is a true educator. She really cares about her students and expects them to reciprocate her effort with their own. On the last day of class, she handed out a letter detailing why she doesn't give many As so make sure that you really work for it. Overall incredible experience.
Professor Byerly's freshman seminar is the type of course where you get out what you put in. The workload is small, but class discussions are enjoyable if you participate. Byerly really just wants you to show some effort and try to engage with the material. Class is not very structured and sometimes a bit slow, but overall pretty chill.
This is an amazing class. Treat it as a chance to experiment. If you're new to public speaking or aren't very confident in your ability, this will come easy. If you're already a good public speaker, learn from the different styles everyone else brings to the table. Your grade is mostly based on your portfolio, so put some effort into it.
Amazing class if you're a bad public speaker, but if you're already solid you won't improve much. An A is not guaranteed
Professor Byerly is fantastic. Her public speaking class is one of the most practical classes out there, and she assigns very valuable exercises to help you improve. She gives a lot of feedback and is so sweet all the time. I would highly recommend taking any of her classes.
Highly recommend for anyone who loves music and would like a low key class and does not mind little class structure.
Professor Byerly is awesome. She assigns a decent amount of reading but when you do the reading and other assigned homework is up to you - it's very flexible. This class is also good for someone who is terrified of public speaking - most of us (including myself) were to some extent. Great class.
As a second semester senior, I can say that Professor Byerly's public speaking class was easily the best class I have taken at Duke. I LOOKED FORWARD to class every Thursday. I learned about public speaking but I also learned even more about "life advice/lessons." This is a MUST. If you graduate from Duke without taking her class, you'll miss out!
I absolutely loved this class. Professor Byerly is one of the best professors I've ever had at Duke. She makes you want to go to class and as long as you show up and do the work that she expects, you will do well in the class. You'll find that you want to do well in the class just for your own benefit and not for the grade. She is amazing!
Professor Byerly is the most engaging and inspiring professor I've ever had at Duke. She was able to create such a comfortable class environment--which was incredibly necessary in a public speaking class. Her assignments were actually enjoyable and I looked forward going to class every week.
This was the best class I have ever taken, and Ingrid Byerly is the best teacher I have ever had.
You really didn't have to do anything for this class except the final project. It taught me less about the finesse of public speaking and more how to speak on the fly, which is useful I guess. Super easy class.
Dr. Byerly is incredible. Her class will challenge and help you grow, which will be super apparent at the end of the semester.  She truly cares about her students and will share all her wisdom and experience. By far my favorite class and favorite professor at Duke.
Most fun I had have with Professor Byerly's public speaking course. You will leave with confidence and a bunch of amazing stories. Recommend everyone take this class before graduating.
Professor Byerly is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She has had amazing life experiences that make the class so interesting, and we do a wide variety of things in this class that improve your overall skills for college. She is so kind, and also very funny. I highly recommend this course, or any class with her!
She was amazing! This is an awesome class to take. Everybody should take this class. Mrs. Byerly gives great feedback and helps you be the best public speaker you can be.
Participation based class
Professor Byerly was probably the most engaging lecturer I had at Duke. She's not just an amazing professor but an amazing person, giving great feedback, fantastic advice, and amusing thoughts. If you will, imagine weekly lectures as engaging and as invigorating as a TED Talks with as many takeaways and that's this class.
Professor Byerly is one the most enthusiastic, warmest people I have ever met.  She makes lectures endlessly enjoyable and teaches you a lot about public speaking and life.
Teacher name: Roy, Arya
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Arya Roy is simply AWESOME! Lectures are dope and really make understanding the material better. The weekly quizzes are pretty difficult . Definitely can't walk in without studying for them unless you are already a master in physics. Usually gives one hard midterm and one easier midterm. Final was very difficult. Overall, great class but not easy!!
Roy is the best lecturer I ever had. He has such a deep understanding of physics and cares a lot about his students. Go to lectures and go to office hours. He has the ability to explain physics like no other professor. Funny guy too
just god
This class was one of the hardest ones I've ever taken, mostly because I failed the first exam, but Roy was always there to help me and really tried to make sure I understood the material. He's one of the smartest people I know, but a bit unorganized. Tests are tough, as he wants you to truly understand things instead of crunching numbers. 10/10
Roys lectures are very well clear and his way of explaining things ensures conceptual understanding rather than memorizing. He usually ties in 1 or 2 interesting practical applications of the theory. Hes very engaging with students and he seems very passionate about the subject. A bit disorganized and tests are tough but manageable.
Great lecturer. he's kind of a mess, but so smart that he can literally improvise his lectures on the spot and have them be great. very personable and charismatic. all girls end up crushing on him for some reason. very willing to help. his tests make sense from what lecture and homework contain. I just wish there were clear legible answer keys.
Arya Roy is an incredible lecturer. Unlike a lot of my other engineering classes at Duke, I actually feel like I learn how to do problems live in lecture. Roy cares that we understand the concepts and that we can do more than crunch numbers. Stay after class to ask questions so that he knows your face.
Only issue I take is with lack of organization in lectures. A typical lecture from him involves a lot of intuition to eventually achieve some kind of result-the problem I have is that I never know what I am supposed to take away. Have we made a definitive statement? Is this result for a specific case? If so, what assumptions have we made?
I love the way Dr. Roy structured his class.  It allows students to engage with the material in the way that's best for them while the weekly quizzes allow you to have consistent feedback about how you're understanding the material.  He was very clear about how he presented material and very patient when helping.
Roy is an absolute godsend - he makes physics so easy to understand and he makes you want to come to class and learn. You'll leave the class learning so much more than just introductory physics, absolutely worth the work and worth the effort.
Professor Roy is truly one of the best professors at Duke, even though I skipped most of the lectures as I already knew the material. He makes you understand the concepts rather than memorize equations, which makes Physics 151DL a very challenging class for those who don't have a background in physics.
A professor who makes the lectures interesting. Roy is super focused on the geometrical meanings of the proofs and problems, and he gives out a good illustration. Lectures and problems are generally not hard, and he gives out notes to help understanding. Super willing to help people.  Textbook is used, but you can survive without it.
Definitely the best teacher I've had so far at Duke.  PHENOMENAL lecturer... please show up to his classes because he's what makes the tuition worth paying.  The class is challenging with those who haven't had a lot of past physics, but it is very possible to do well if you work hard.
He's an amazing dude that connects with his students and makes sure they understand concepts rather than memorize equations. 10/10 would take again.
Arya makes his lectures entertaining and easy to follow, but he also provides notes on sakai (so you don't need to be there to do well). Highly recommend going and FLUNCHing him.
Arya has a great physics mind but leans towards teaching theory rather than practical examples, which can be frustrating for an "engineering" physics class. His homework is much harder than the test or quiz problems, but sometimes he'll throw something weird in there you've never seen before so study carefully.
Every lecture was like getting your mind blown for an hour! The homework was hard, but Arya's awesome explanations as well as overall hilarity was a great combo!
He is amazing in every way and so helpful and humble
He is an amazing lecturer who explains concepts in a very manageable and intuitive way. Very charismatic.
I took the class over a 6 week summer period and moved at a pretty fast pace. However, Dr. Roy offered a lot of support, advice, and help in and out of the classroom. He was very charismatic and almost made me enjoy the material, which helped me complete the enormous workload needed to be successful in the class.
Teacher name: Canelas, Dorian
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
canelas is a really entertaining lecturer, but with the actual material she's kinda confusing in class. also go to discussion the FR on the midterms are based off discussion problems and the MC are off sapling. dropping the lowest midterm and replacing it with the final is great but the final is super hard so try to do well on all 3 midterms
I have a hard time writing thisbecause I really do like Dr. Canalas. Shes fun and cares about her students. She just cant lecture. I learned very little from class, and unfortunately my discussion TA was often unhelpful. There was little corellation between the tests and lecture/hw. Take my adviceif you can take orgo do it. If not, take 101.
Great professor, horrible class. Honestly the flipped classroom was terrible. You're expected to know random information that the TA's and the professor do not teach and they provide no textbook for supplemental help. When Dr. Canelas did lecture, which was rare, she was very personal and funny. If you have AP chem credit, just got to organic.
The flipped structure tended to be a polarizing subject- I loved it, others hated it. I think independent students with a strong chemistry background who enjoy working out problems will really enjoy the class. Due to the class structure, Canelas only lectures once a week. When she does lecture though, it's quite enjoyable- she's really hilarious!
Although I heard she's a great orgo prof, her chem 110 class was the worst. Flipped classroom sucked. She was pretty lazy too, providing little help and letting TAs make ridiculously hard quizzes and midterms. Midterms are worth a lot, so don't mess up. 90% of your time in this class won't be learning; it will be doing stupid applications.
Her Chem110 class is technically flipped but every Monday lecture she did notes (which are always posted) and covered the material of the week. Had a quiz every week and did team based applications. Monday is optional but you must go Wednesday and Friday because you work in groups on problems. Shes a great prof and a funny, kind lady.
Great team-based course. Otherwise, it is a great course that applies previous knowledge about chemistry to a variety of scenarios. Additionally, Monday discussion lectures are always optional, but they are always helpful and entertaining. Canelas makes a point of making sure students have a good time. She tells great stories.
I have taken Canelas for both 201 and 210. She is the best chemistry teacher I have had at Duke. Chem210 was difficult for me and I had to spend many hours working problems, but Canelas was always helpful after class and during office hours. Her lectures went fast but were clear and examples work were hard.
When it comes to actually teaching, don't hold your breath. Expect to go through tons of different resources by yourself and teach yourself the material. Prepare to discuss the material for one day and have homework due the next day and a quiz the following day. Ex: we were supposed to cover four topics &amp; had barely gone over 1 by the end of class
Professor Canelas is a phenomenal lecturer.  She is very funny and explains the concepts extremely well.  Sometimes she'll waste too much time making jokes, but it does keep the class engaged.  Her tests are very fair and a lot of the questions come from topics she talks about specifically in class, so I would strongly recommend going to lecture.
Funny but WAYYYYY too easy. Wasn't prepared for orgo2. If this is your last orgo class, take her. If not, opt for someone harder.
Definitely the easiest orgo professor at Duke. We played Jeopardy. Relatively little theory in lectures compared to the number of examples. Test questions were slight variants of lecture problems. TAKE HER IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA! She's pretty funny too.
Was not very helpful outside of class and would redirect me to different resources rather than attempt to explain the material. A lot of the important concepts on the tests were not covered in lectures, and the class required a lot of self-studying. Also, be prepared for two required 8:30 discussions each week (which are group work).
I loved Canelas! She was pretty funny in class and she taught pretty well. Her exams aren't too difficult and they were fair. She does give partial credit so put an answer for each question. She loves it when people participate in her class and she had us do clicker questions to gauge our understanding of the material.
Organic Chemistry is a tough subject, but Dr. Canelas' instructions make the course bearable. The class was definitely difficult but not impossible. You just have to be prepared to do a lot of work.
One of Duke's best professors; goes at a very, very fast pace but is kind, hilarious, and a great teacher. If you put in the work, you'll succeed.
Prof. Canelas is a pretty straightforward lecturer and grader. Her grading procedures are fair but the tests can be difficult. It's essential to do the reading and practice problems in a timely fashion if you want to succeed on the tests and final. She's not much of a help if you reach out outside of class though.
Dr. Canelas is a funny, engaging lecturer who makes concepts super easy to understand. That being said, it's still necessary to read the textbook and work tons of practice problems every day to fully grasp and master the material for exams. She gives you everything you need to succeed in the class -- oh, and lots of partial credit on exams, too.
While her lectures are good and informative, you won't do very well if you don't do a lot of self teaching. This class requires a LOT of work.
Dr. Canelas is an amazing professor who is really enthusiastic about course material and always cares about how her students are doing in the class. She is very approachable and lectures are very enjoyable. The class definitely requires work, but she makes the class enjoyable and the material interesting! Had her for two semesters and loved her!
Teacher name: Nechyba, Thomas
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Nechyba wrote the textbook and it shows when he is doing lecture. You can easily fall behind in this class so having a solid study group and participation in discussion sections are very highly recommended. The class is curved to a B+ but the class also has very driven people so make sure you're one of them so you don't end up behind the pack.
Prof Nechyba gives great and personable lectures. He's super smart - he wrote the textbook - and really tries to help his students out with review sessions before midterms. The class is really difficult and material builds fast, so avoid falling behind by going to TA sections. Your grade is essentially only test grades (though curved to a B+).
Nechyba is a very knowledgable professor who loves to teach. Holds extra review sessions even on Sundays before the tests. The class itself is very rigorous and the lectures tend to be very dry at some points. The textbook comes in handy a lot of times. His tests are insanely tough but I'd recommend taking the class with him only.
great lectuere, probably one of the best. help is really accessible outside of class with TAs, discussions, office hours, etc. doing the homework is really important to do well in the class. attendance definitely helps but isn't mandatory. with that being said, the midterms and final is very hard. taking this course in spring is probably easier
This class was the hardest class I have taken so far. The lectures are very dense and the material is hard to understand. Nechyba is great/well versed on this topic, but his lectures/textbook tend to be unnecessarily wordy. Definitely recommend hitting up office hours (with Chelsea- she taught the class this spring) and spending time on the info
Great prof do well on your final and you're good
Nechyba is an amazing dude. He's really entertaining in lectures and really cares about teaching his students the material (he did write the textbook). Tests are extremely tough and make up almost all your grade but it's graded on a curve. It's a hard class but as long as you put in hard work it's manageable
Phenomenal professor who is passionate about economics and makes each lecture entertaining. He also wrote the textbook, which is very well written and becomes a valuable resource for mastering the material. The class is fast paced and tests are definitely hard, but there is a fairly lenient grading policy in place.
Great professor who truly cares about the material and student success. I never attended class as the in-class quizzes could be completed from anywhere. The book is a great resource for getting an in-depth understanding of the material. Exams are fairly difficult, but predictable if you review past exams. Material builds quickly.
Smart as hell, nice and funny. Tests are basically the only thing that decide your grade, so make sure you study for those. The class isn't easy and the material builds, but Nechyba is simply great at explaining tough concepts and makes himself very available before exams to help everyone out.
Funny and nice teacher, but lectures can often be a bit confusing, so it's helpful to read the textbook if needed. Exams are really difficult and frustrating, make sure to go see TA's and ask questions.
Nechyba is a great lecturer, explains things clearly and has a good sense of humor. Since he wrote the textbook you don't really need to read it in addition because everything is covered in the lectures. Grading is very fair and he is very transparent about the grading system.
Nechyba is a  brilliant professor and he knows his Economics. Beware though: the material builds up rapidly, and if you are lazy, you will not survive in this class. It's a tough class, but if you put effort into it, you will do  fine. Also, get maximum prepared for every exam, because your whole grade depends on two midterms and a final.
Great Lecturer, turning grades back in a timely manner
Arguably the best Econ professor at Duke, he knows the material better than anyone else (wrote the textbook) so his lectures are very clear and organized. Workload consists of a problem set a week. His tests are difficult, you have to work hard and study a lot to earn a good grade. But in the end, most students usually do well (B/B+ average).
Very tough class and material but Professor Nechyba did a great job of explaining it during lectures. He is always on top of grading and gives plenty of resources for the exams. The midterms and final are all really difficult with the average grade being lower than 65. But the class is curved to a B/B+ and there is a very flexible grading policy.
Nechyba is extremely passionate and actually enjoys teaching. He's department chair so he's not very accessible out of class but the TA office hours and review sessions that he holds are pretty helpful. Mid-semester he hands the class off to an assistant professor but is still there for all the lectures. Generally this prof isn't as good as Nechyba
He is one of the best professors I've ever had.
Best professor I have ever had at Duke!
Very good professor, clear lectures based on book he wrote. Can skip class and get A, as textbook is written by him and extremely useful. Clearly wants to help student. Lectures can be entertaining with jokes, songs (look out for Barney song), and more jokes. Was wrongly criticised on Yikyak for harsh grade distribution (totally untrue!)
Teacher name: Blake, Lewis
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great classes. Brilliant and smart. math 112 is just a bad bad class in general. but he made it better than i expected. not to say i ended up with a good grade in the end. he's caring and lets you retake tests. but get ready to work. theres no reason intro calc should be this bad. but if you ABSOLUTELY NEED IT on your transcript, take him for sure
Professor Blake is a wonderful and kind-hearted professor who makes learning math as tolerable as it can possibly be.
Blake is a great person, very enthusiastic about the course and wants you to learn.  Willing to meet outside of class, and will answer any questions you have.  Doesn't like it if you're late though, if you respect him and do what you're supposed to do, he respects you.  Homework almost every night, but do it if you want an A.
You can tell Blake has taught this class many times before because he knows the material extremely well and is great at explaining it. It helps to go to lectures. There is optional homework, but it helps a lot. He puts a few practice problems on each test. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, the class won't be as bad as rumored.
Prof. Blake is very very clear and makes math enjoyable. If I had to take math again, I would definitively take it with him.
Math is notoriously hard at Duke, and I am positive that I would not have passed nor done well in this class if it weren't for Professor Blake. Best Professor I've had at Duke, and probably the best I will ever have. Very knowledgable and excited about teaching, makes you work for your grade but it's such a reward when you do well.
Math classes at Duke will most likely be the hardest classes you ever take. That being said, Professor Blake is extremely knowledgeable, passionate, and will go out of his way to help you. Tough class, great professor.
Definitely one of the best Math professors at Duke. If you have to take Math, take it with him!
Truly one of the best professors I've had the privilege of studying under at Duke. A phenomenal resource, he is always willing to spend extra time covering difficult topics until everyone understands them. He grades hard and collects homework. Lectures are somehow kept interesting, despite it being math. Would highly recommend.
Blake is very organized and his explanations made understanding Calculus 2 topics easy. Make sure you keep up with the work!
Best professor I have had at Duke! He's amazing at explaining tough concepts and he is very helpful when you have questions. He cares about your performance in class too. Go to lectures and do the HW assignments - it really makes a difference on tests.
Blake is an amazing professor. I had him for calc 1 and 2. He's clear and will really help you understand. His tests are really hard though and hes a stickler on time and I couldn't ever fully finish his tests. But hes a great math 111 and 112 professor
He is probably the best professor I've had at Duke so far. Super clear, very helpful, and really makes an attempt to make sure you get the material. Intro calculus is going to be difficult no matter who is teaching it but he makes it absolutely manageable.
Professor Blake is extremely kind and makes calc as bearable as possible. He's always willing to help or re-explain material. I understood concepts I hadn't after sitting through a year of HS calc. The tests are hard, but there's no way around that. I've never liked math, but Prof. Blake is excellent; take calc with him if you can!
Probably failed his course. But wasn't his fault. He didn't even get to write the final. Super nice guy. Amazing professor. Highly recommend taking his class for 112. Definitely tough on the grading. But if you actually put the work in and really study hard for the midterms, you'll be fine. Do the prob sets and don't sleep on those labs either.
Blake is a phenomenal professor.  he is extremely helpful and truly loves teaching. Math111 and 112 are not easy classes, but Blake makes them bearable and doable. Tests aren't awful - on par with any college Calculus course.
Professor Blake is the most awesome math professor you'll ever meet. His ability to explain fundamental concepts into things you can understand is just incredible. He will prepare you very well for the because his tests are very conceptual - which is what the final will be like.  (I took 111 and 112 with him, and wish he taught other math classes)
Blake was an incredible teacher! Incredibly clear and cared about his students. Within the first couple weeks he knew all our names and if someone had any issues he was more than happy to break it down. Tests were hard but if put in effort in class and with homework you should be fine
Blake is definitely the best teacher for Math 111 (old # 31). Willing to help you if you put in the work, and he does a good job in class of explaining how he wants you to answer specific types of problems. Would be very difficult if you had never taken calc, but if you have to take 111, take it with Blake. (He gave out candy during the final!)
I had him for 31L and 32L. He is extremely clear in lectures, and an overall excellent teacher that kept me engaged. This class is brutally hard because of the curve, though I felt like I definitely improved my math skills a lot (C+ in 31L and B+ in 32L) but the fact remains that this class is a GPA killer no matter what teacher you have.
Teacher name: Craig, Steven
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Chem 110 is terrible.  Don't take it if you don't have to.  It's set up so that it's very hard to get a good grade and you don't learn that much.
This is a hard class, but Dr. Craig is good at explaining some of the more difficult concepts. He is patient, easygoing, and cares for his students. Beware that this is a flipped class. In my case, I often felt lost during team discussions or would have no idea as to how to start a problem. The tests aren't too hard.
Pretty difficult class, but interesting.  Craig's enthusiasm is contagious.  Stay on top of the learning over the weekend and you'll do well on the Monday quizzes.  Try to understand the applications with help of your team.  TAs are moderately helpful.  Lab is very manageable  only every other week and can be fun.
Quiz every Monday and it's a filpped class so get ready to lead materials over the weekend. Discussions are optional not that helpful. Lab TAs grade very easily.
The class is flipped so Craig doesn't lecture per se (only in office hours) Most in class learning is in team applications and quizzes. Craig is great at explaining concepts but sometimes he goes too far in depth.
I love this man.  He is one of the most passionate professors at Duke, very kind and down to earth.  The class is very application based, and for those that prefer application over memorization, it is definitely a good choice.  Class isn't very hard, and he lets the class as a whole decide the weighting!
Dr. Craig is an awesome professor who wants his students to succeed. That said, the class I took with him had a "flipped classroom", which involved most lectures/learning done outside the classroom. His quizzes and tests were fair, if a bit difficult, and his (and TA's) in-class feedback was excellent.
His class is flipped, so prepare to watch hours of videos outside of class to understand the concepts. Aside from that, Craig is a good professor who is always willing to help if you have a question. He answers almost anything as long as it doesn't give you the answer. Very practical applications of chemistry. Take this class!
A lot of people are intimidated by the flip classroom style that Dr. Craig has but for what he teaches, I think it works really well. He's very passionate about teaching and wants his students to do well. Basically, he's awesome.
Craig is a great guy and really wants you to do well. The class is flipped so you will have to read a lot and time in class is spent taking quizzes or doing group application problems. He'll always answer questions and do his best to explain, but sometimes it gets too abstract. He has a passion for the subject, even though it's a pretty hard class
This class is flipped so Dr. Craig doesn't really teach the class much. However, I feel like when Dr. Craig does, he is a very good professor, and I honestly feel like the flipped style is beneficial because Dr. Craig is able to incorporate a lot more details and concepts, especially for orgo, that the chem 101 kids don't get.
Dr. Craig was the best professor I have ever had.  He always helps  by answering questions after lecture or boosting grades wherever he could.  Application problems helped me learn concepts. Flipped classroom works really well.  However, YOU need to take initiative.  Go to class every Friday and ask questions at office hours and you will be fine!
Dr. Craig is an amazing professor and he wants everyone to understand and do well. He's one of those people who love teaching and are meant to do it. I'm not sure I'm a fan of the flipped classroom but my teammates were great to study with. Labs were a constant source of stress. Overall good class.
Dr. Craig really seems to believe in the merit of his flipped-classroom method, which I can respect. Lectures are spent either doing quizzes or team-based problem solving. I did learn a bit from my teammates, and it was probably more enjoyable than traditional lectures would have been. However, the class didn't seem worth my tuition at all.
Very effectively takes advantage of flipped classroom concept. If you're not already familiar with chem you will need to study a bit before class to get through weekly quizzes and team application problems. Class is very cooperative and problem-solving-oriented.
Lab section was more brutal than the course. Professor Craig is very cool - wish he taught us more but because the course was flipped it was truly dependent on A.) the ability of your team B.) your motivation and C.) how well you can work backwards from solution keys to the application problems.
Dr. Craig is an amazing professor who loves what he teaches. The class is flipped which was good for me since I can never stay awake during long lectures. Grading is fair and as long as you understand the team application problems you will be fine.
Best professor at duke. Extremely intelligent and approachable. Explains concepts really well and knows what you are actually asking even if sometimes you are not sure.  Tests are hard but if you understand the applications you will have no problem on them. Nice guy and try a lot of ways to boost your grades up.
Craig's a great guy. He'll help when you ask and he is pretty generous with grade adjustment. That being said, the classroom is flipped and the model just doesn't work for this particular class. The resources given are not great in quality and when he lectures (which is rare), it's often too complicated to understand.
I'm torn. His applications are hard for stupid reasons but he loves curving your grade upwards and helping you. He's incredibly smart and teaches incredibly well during discussion section, but he hardly ever lectures and instead wastes your time with his flipped classroomapplication Q's. This is less work though than Chem 101 believe it or not.
Teacher name: Forbes, Jeffrey

Teacher comments: 
Really not a good lecturer at all, and no textbook and unclear slides make it worse. Its as if someone handed him the slides five minutes before class and said heres what youre teaching. Its not a good course if you have to rely on TAs and office hours just to do the assignments and to learn anything. Would avoid at all costs
This class was very disorganized - due dates were often pushed back/changed and many things were unclear. Lectures were not great at all and there was no textbook to refer to, which made piecing things together tough.
The issue w/ CS 201 was that the lectures were disorganized. Too much lecture time was wasted on administrative stuff. I got most learning out of the undergraduate TA discussions. I was not able to make broad connections between topics, and although I was able to do all of the projects, I don't feel that much more confident in my coding ability.
super nice guy and very accomplished outside of class, but is just really not great at teaching. )-:
Forbes is a really smart and very sweet professor but can't explain anything. Lectures were useless and instructions to assignments were like reading a foreign language. Nothing was laid out for you. I had to rely heavily on online resources, friends and TAs. He is a kind grader to make up for his poor lecturing skills.
CS201 is taught very poorly by Forbes. The material is very relevant to computer science, but the class is poorly taught -- unorganized, unclear, and ad-hoc. He needs to act on the feedback given to him. He's been teaching this course for so long, and it is disappointing that such an important course isn't taught better or by a better instructor.
Professor Forbes is honestly one of the most inspirational people I've ever met and the reason why I'm still pursuing Computer Science today. He's an incredibly gifted teacher who really loves the subject matter and wants everyone to do well. Coursework is pretty straightforward and exams are BIG. Oh, can't forget that he's straight fire too.
Forbes seems like a really nice guy... but he's nearly incoherent when he lectures, especially if you have not take a CS course before.
he's a nice dude he's a good dude he kinda can't teach but he cares! but he can't teach but he's nice so it's all ok : ) i am suffering
Although he's a nice guy and good at admin work, Forbes is a terrible lecturer. Despite some improvements as compared to previous years, he still struggled to make the audience actually understand what's going on. And during most of his lectures he only managed to finish up until half of the lecture slides. Be prepared for some self-learning.
It was hard in the beginning to adjust from Python to Java if you came from 101. Projects were confusing and there was a lot of homework, whether it was projects or APTs. Luckily the APT solutions were posted. Tests weren't too bad and they made the higher midterm grade your total midterm grade.
Here's a tip for ya professor: don't close the participation surveys so only the people who show up will know when to complete them. Instead, stop making your lectures an exercise in suffering and maybe people will come to lecture because they want to. This guy is terrible.
Lectures were mind-numbingly boring. Instructions on projects were almost stupefyingly difficult to understand. The class, however, is not terribly difficult. Spend some time teaching yourself Java and you'll be fine. Forbes is a fine person, but a truly unengaging teacher.
Nice guy
CS 201: APTs (short coding problems, very fun) due biweekly. Projects (longer interwoven code that has terrible documentation) due biweekly. Two midterms, one final. Forbes: First half of class he wastes on "logistics" and in the second half he inevitably attempts to explain some topic using a convoluted analogy that no one really understands.
I had 201 with Astrachan and Forbes together alternating the weeks that they lectured. I think since this is the second (or third?) time Forbes is teaching 201 and that he was doing it along with Astrachan that it went much better than Forbes's previous time(s) teaching 201. I like him more at 2x speed, though. He talks very slowly.
Not bad
201 is very self-directed. Most of the learning is done on your own b/c it requires practice more than anything. Forbes cares about his students &amp; is always available/willing to help you out. He gets a bad rep b/c of the nature of the class, but if you go to Duke you should be able to teach yourself. Don't underestimate the class &amp; you'll be fine.
Forbes is a nice guy and he tries to get to know you (even though there were over 200 people in my lecture section), but he simply isn't a great instructor. He spent a lot of time going over logistics rather than teaching us the material, and I had to teach myself everything. Unclear grading criteria. Take this class with someone else.
Prof Forbes seems like a nice guy to grab beer with but you wouldn't want him in charge of anything else. Wait, isn't that what people say about George Bush? Anyways, Forbes has unclear EXPECTATIONS. For example, unclear grading standards, incorrect answers on test reviews, etc. Only positive: giving us more coding practice than other profs
Teacher name: Broverman, Sherryl
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Broverman's lectures are very disorganized. What she says does not match what's on the test, so her tests are far from accurate assessments of her students. It's extremely frustrating to be in her class because the material is not difficult, but the grades students get would indicate otherwise. She doesn't teach and then tests as if she has.
I am so glad I had Prof. Broverman during my first semester here at Duke. Not only is she extremely knowledgable about global health but she also genuinely takes an interest in the lives of her students. She really puts a lot of effort into ensuring that her class and the entire Global Health FOCUS program are positive experiences for new students.
Write down everything that comes out of her mouth during lectures for tests and homework. Tests are take-home but the questions are hard + vague to the point that you won't always know what she's looking for. Participation is EXTREMELY important in this class: raise your hand to ask a BS question 3-4 times during class to get participation points.
Dr. Broverman is one of the best lecturers that I've ever had at Duke. Although her class sizes are large, she always makes you feel engaged.
Go to class and take notes; lecture slides are posted online but they're pretty vague. Plus, Broverman is a funny and engaging lecturer, which helps in remembering the material and makes going to class worthwhile. For tests, just take the practice exams and skim over your lecture notes, and you should pass without a problem.
Dr. Broverman's Global Diseases focus class is easy to do well in as long as you attend class and participate. She has interesting presentations, and if you listen and ask questions, every assignment and test is fairly easy to complete. Not a big time commitment.
Dr. Broverman is a great professor.  From her FOCUS program to her AIDS class to WISER, she takes her students seriously and invests time in her relationships with them.  Bio180FS was for the Global Health FOCUS, and it was a great blend of biology and global health.  Would recommend Global Health FOCUS but would certainly recommend Dr. B!
Very much a "get out what you put in" class. Broverman is great- super knowledgeable, caring, and a great lecturer. She's a little spacey on administrative stuff. She can tell who's really invested and who's not a mile off, so don't even try with her if you don't care.
This class was pretty easy and interesting for me and some of my friends, but I had other ones who really struggled. If you're not a huge science person but you're looking for a science course to take, this is a good one. It's a huge lecture, so you don't have to show up. Grades are based on three short assignments, two midterms, and a final.
Dr. Broverman is a fantastic and knowledgeable professor. She makes the material accessible for students who don't have much Bio experience, and makes her lectures interesting with her great sense of humor. I disagree with comments about the TA's grading; there's a clear rubric by what you can see from previous exams and graded assginments
Dr. Broverman is an amazing faculty member who is doing great work however her lectures were boring. Also, the TA's are in charge of all the grading in the class and are ridiculously tough graders. There are no rubrics, which makes the situation even worse. Overall, the topic is interesting but there is little guidance and arbitrary grading.
While taking this class, I didn't understand what all the hype was about; but now that it's over, I understand. Dr. Broverman is disorganized and a confusing lecturer at times, but the material is extremely interesting, interdisciplinary, and relevant to a world where poverty and disease are the (often overlooked) norm in many places.
I heard really good things about this class from others, but I think something was off this semester because the class was just meh.  The topic was really interesting and Prof. Broverman does amazing work, but the lectures were pretty disorganized and I felt the grading was too specific.  Be sure to do the homework well and study for the tests.
Dr. Broverman is held in high regards by many Duke students. While the course content was interesting and important, I found Dr. Broverman's lectures mundane and aloof. It was almost as if she had taught the course so many times that she no longer had any interest in teaching it. It's an easy NS credit, but I'd take any praises with a grain of salt
She is such a bad professor. Please don't take her class. She is so disorganized and this class is the last thing on her mind. Normally, it wouldn't be a HUGE deal but the class suffers as a result of her disorganization. SO BAD. She should not be teaching.
Listen, don't take from her unless it's required. Dr. B is rude and condescending. Yes, she knows a lot, but she doesn't know how to get through to students. She can be scattered and behind. Grading takes forever and rubrics are nonexistent. Favorites in class are clear, and she can be very sarcastic.
She was disorganized, gave unclear and unhelpful feedback, and was often frazzled and unprepared for class. Although she is knowledgeable, she sometimes came across as condescending towards students.
This class got me through freshman year! Broverman cares about her students and learned dozens of us by name (which is amazing given that the class had nearly 300 students). Although it's a Biology class, she manages to make the class very relevant to her student's every day lives.  If she taught another class, I would certainly be in it.
I loved my class with Broverman. She is extremely interested in what she is teaching about and that shines through. I do agree that her lectures could be more organized, but it wasn't bad enough to really impact my learning process. I loved this class and will really miss it, highly recommend!
Dr. Broverman is nice, fun professor and has done really some really cool things, but she is one of the most disorganized professors ever. Her grading is very arbitrary. If you want clear cut directions, you won't get any. Also she NEVER responds back to the emails you send her.
Teacher name: Banks, David
School name: Duke University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He makes you work for it but at the end of the day you will learn a lot, be inspired, and do well in class
Banks is a fantastic teacher. I learnt x2 more in this class than any other I have taken at Duke and the content I learnt will serve me the rest of my life.
One of the best professors I've had at Duke. Makes every lecture entertaining, and he's extremely well-known in the stats world. Unless you've been hiding for the entire semester, it's likely Dr. Banks knows your name. It's quite a workload (a quiz each class), but he goes through each homework assignment at his office hours so HW isn't stressful.
Overall Banks is a pretty good professor. You need to stay on top of the material and actually study for the quizzes that are every class. If you don't, your grade will drop. Quizzes were more of a pain than the tests. Definitely go to office hours to get help with the homework otherwise you will lose points there too.
Prof Banks knows pretty much everything there is to know about Statistics. That being said this was by far the most work intensive class I have taken as an Econ major thus far at Duke. With a quiz literally every single class and 4 midterms make sure you are not taking this with a lot of other work heavy classes.
The man is an absolute legend. One of the smartest professors on campus for sure. Tests are pretty tough but pretty reasonable.
Best professor I've had so far at Duke. You have to go to class because of the daily quizzes but they actually help you keep up with material. Go to his office hours! He goes over a lot of the solutions to the homework problems which can otherwise seem impossible.
D Banks is too smart to be teaching this class. He is an engaging professor and expects too much from his students, but the class is interesting and you will learn a lot. He is a generous grader is general and is not out to give poor grades.
Good.
Dr. Banks is a decent professor-- a genius and cares about his students, but can be confusing and move really fast in lectures. Does a good job of showing students how statistics is relevant to real life. Daily quizzes almost killed me, but did help make sure I knew the material. Office hours are great-- he basically does the problem set for you.
Hate myself for saying this but Prof Banks is a F'ing legend. Yeah he's probably way to smart to be teaching this class and sometimes can be hard to follow in lecture and the daily quizzes are a little ridiculous but if you want a future in stats he is hands down the best professor you could ask for. Test &amp; HW are hard but he curves fairly.
This class had an insane workload-quizzes every lecture and ridiculous homework assignments. The curve both made and killed my grade, since students who had time to study for quizzes on a daily basis did way better. Do not take this class with other difficult classes.
No words to describe how nice and helpful he is! Quizzes everyday are annoying/stressful &amp; the tests are hard; he posts practice versions that are very similar so if you learn those then you'll be good. HW is hard but you can find some of the answers online. An annoying amount of work. He is a fantastic person but don't recommend this class :/
Dr. Banks is great. Almost too smart and moves quickly, but very willing to help. This class is hard but not impossible. Daily quizzes and weekly problem sets can be rough but are actually really helpful for tests, which are not cumulative. If you stay on top of it, put in the work, and go to office hours, you'll be fine.
Absurdly hard class. He's very knowledgable, but he's almost too smart to be teaching this class. Had a very hard time relating the material to his students.
Banks is straightforward, very helpful, and definitely wants to make sure you aren't suffering with his class. The work load is intense but not unbearable. Expect quizzes every class all semester. Midterms are tough but Banks is very invested in making sure his students get help if they need it.
Great professor who takes great strides to make his large lecture class feel more like a small seminar.  Course material is incredibly fast-paced and difficult, but rewarding if you manage to stay on top of your work and keep up.  You do get to drop your lowest HW, Lab, midterm, and 2 quizzes, which is helpful.  No final exam.
Go to class and review each class before quiz. Expect to spend around 10 hours a week outside of class (probably double that when you have a midterm) and you should have at least an A-.
D-Banks is the man. That being said, Stat 111 is rough. It is, by a considerable margin, the most work-intensive course I have ever taken in my entire life. Quizzes every day, 4 midterm exams, and they're all very hard. I had to work very hard to get an A- in this class, and people with tougher schedules than me had it way worse.
He is the best!
Teacher name: Wissink, Jennifer
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Her lectures are clear. Just study past prelims then review them for the final and you'll be good.
Had her for 1110 and 1120. Lectures are not terribly interesting but they cover most of what is on the exam. Homework is easy points so don't miss out. Also offers iclicker extra-credit. Textbook is useful for reviewing info but not terribly necessary. Be sure to do the practice tests and psets before the exam.
Confusing lecturer, though its obvious she's passionate about economics
She uses terrible examples for what she talks about. She rushes through lectures and her example pictures often leaving seconds for you to figure out what she just drew on the graph. I clicker points are important in each lecture. As well as the online quizes which are nothing like the class but important. Prelims are hard, but not the worst.
Wissink is the worst professor ever. She is rude during office hours and wastes time during lecture to talk about the history of economics instead of showing how to do problems and concepts that are on her prelims. The multiple choice questions on her prelims and final are worth so many points and really kill the overall test scores.
The class itself was pretty easy in general, just show up and pay attention in lectures and sections. Do the MEL quizzes and use iclickers for easy points. Prelims were extremely similar to practice prelims but the final was different. Wissink was awful at explaining concepts but there are many resources to help you.
Teach yourself, and don't be fooled by her practice tests.
If you've never taken Econ before DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It is the worse. There are too many unrelated/unecessary things that just take up time. The prelims are really hard and the class isn't very organized. A lot of unecessary info.
Overall, this class was one that shouldn't be hard. There are a ton of resources but I don't know many people who bother using them. She is a little disconnected from the student experience and will sometimes rush through material that is difficult and then move sluggishly through easy stuff. Overall, not bad
Has probably taught econ too long to remember what it's like to be a learning student. She clearly knows her stuff and is an incredibly friendly professor, but sometimes she's not very clear in her teaching. The textbook helps.
I've never seen a professor be more disrespectful to her students. When I went into her office hours, she belittled me in front of other students who were there for asking a question that "I should know the answer to". Her lectures are boring, her online presence is unorganized (3 separate sites? really?), and isn't good at teaching the concepts.
Took for both micro/macro. Although she covers material quickly, teaches it well, provides a TREMENDOUS amount of resources, and teaches it FULLY. Leaves no stone unturned. Also fair in grading. Best, shes kind and down-to-earth and provides plenty of office hours. Want to succeed? WORK HARD! Youll learn a ton. One of my favorite professors.
Good Professor, she is very interesting and is passionate about the subject. Two ways of grading which can help students. Attendance is not mandatory but it helps your grade. If you want an A, study previous exams, do the MEL online quizzes, and attend the lectures!
As a whole, awesome professor, very intelligble about Economics, very helpful during office hours. The lectures kinda get boring and very early in the day as well. all the prelims follow her old ones The text is kinda useless
Tries her best to CONFUSE her students. Goes on about irrelevant details but when it comes time to learn the important things, speeds up and leaves students confused. Ohours help but are by no means amazing. iClicker attendance (optional) used for extra credit, which is a huge help considering she isn't the best! Tests are just like practice exams!
So boring.
Wissink's lectures weren't the most entertaining, but they were very informative. If you attend all the lectures, there's not that much need to use the textbook. Her prelims were very similar to the practice ones and the Panopto videos were helpful if you ever skip lecture.
Wissink was good.  Not fantastic but very good.  Class is too big.  She's much better in smaller settings like when she did a group office hour before the final.  Go to lecture.  Then do her sample prelims and old posted problem sets. That's what I did and it worked great for me.  Does talk a bit too fast.
Basically solid.  Buying the text book was a waste of money.  If you go to lecture and use the slides she posts and sometimes the panopto videos that are there too you can figure it all out.  Not a fan of the MEL stuff.
This class was at 9:05 in the morning but Wissink was always early and willing to chat with anyone who was there.  The slides were helpful but a bit sloppy when she wrote on them - but maybe that was because of her broken wrist. The practice work really helped a lot. Don't buy the text, just but into MEL cheapest option.
Teacher name: Owens, Thomas
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Overall you learn very little in this class.  His goal is to make you use critical thinking to answer questions, but in the end his teaching style means that you don't end up learning much about biology.  His office hours are very helpful, but he tends to tear apart the people who ask questions.  The class also has a harsh curve, all tests are T/F.
"My thinking questions are the type of evaluations you can expect on the MCAT". No Prof Owens, Ive taken the MCAT and can attest that memorization is far more valued than your method of TF grading which serves to primarily induce stress, confusion, and skewed expectations for premeds. Still must admit, he is very commited to teaching vital concepts
Here's the deal: If you're the type of person who has gotten by so far in life by memorizing text books then this class isn't for you. Ownens asks questions that require you to have a deep understanding of the material beyond the simple facts. They are difficult, but fair.
Worst class I ever chose to take.  The class is more of an exercise in proving the textbook wrong than it is understanding material.  The tests were all truefalse and completely destroyed everyone grade-wise.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!
This dude is mad smart and I think he has difficulty conveying all of what's in his head. The prelims are tricky, but they make for really good discussion. Your study group will carry you, but you better know your material and how to manipulate it.
Tom Owens is better at proving the textbook wrong than conveying information to students. Easily the worst mistake I've made since coming here has been taking this class in the fall with him. TF Qs ONLY, a confusing as hell examgroup exam grading system, and a CURVED PARTICIPATION GRADE made this easily the worst class experience I have so far.
Go to office hours - they really help!
Owens is a great lecturer and knows the material well, but his prelims test how much you're able to think like him, rather than how much of the material you know. The best thing about him is that he lets you re-take each test with your study group for extra credit. This is the best way to understand your mistakes in this class.
Yeah um this class was a disaster. If you're a hard worker, it won't really matter unless you can get around tricky test questions. Honestly this class is just a way of giving students who know the material well, and who got 4's and 5's on their AP Biology exams, bad grades. Just an awful experience.
If you're looking for an intro biology class to take, I'd take one where your grade is not based on wordy truefalse confusing tests! Maybe I would take again as a sophomore, but disastrous first "science" course at Cornell!
All test questions are truefalse. Extremely tricky questions and you must understand the material beyond the textbook. Seriously need to understand how he words the questions on the exams to do well in the class. Majority of your grade is based on test grades.
Good guy, very smart and cares a lot about the material. Lecture are helpful but personally I wouldn't go to them if he didn't take attendance through those mini (ungraded) quizzes. Tests are east once you get the hang of them, but it may take one or two prelims to do so. The best way to study is not to just memorize but to understand the material.
He is an amazing professor who is always there for his students. He truly cares and his office hours are extremely helpful. People who dislike him just don't utilize all the help he offers. He says it himself this is not a memorization course
You think you substantially know the material but it doesn't really help when you're taking a prelim. The truefalse tests are incredibly difficult and make you feel bad about yourself. Attend Owen's office hours if you want to receive a satisfactory grade. Take this in the Spring!
This class is/isn't worth studying for. Read the text, participated in study group, + attended some office hours, still got killed by T/F exams. :( Take this in the spring, or take a BIOEE instead!!!
You have to think like him to do well in the class. It's probably better to take it as a sophomore (after you take cell biology BIOMG 1350 as a freshman). His exams are pretty confusing and might not measure how much you studied. If you want to stick with the class, go to his office hours!!! This is the ticket to not failing!
Very smart person and expects you to be just as smart. his t/f exams are tricky and requires you to know the txtbk material VERY well and then APPLY them to the situation. go to office hours and listen even if you dont have questions. go to lectures and take notes on what he says. He is pretty condescending when explaining an answer to a question..
The exams are super hard. The trick to the class is attending his office hours. According a vast majority of the students I know, that's where he bases his Prelim questions on.
So vague, when asking questions he gives vague answers/"big picture" yet some of his test questions are so specific. Try to take this class in the Spring!
I put so much effort into this class, but still got killed by the course. True/false exams were really tricky.
Teacher name: Currie, Bruce
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Spoke in circles.. not very organized teacher, but considerate
Domestic Animal Biology-great class. The textbook provided relevant information (written by the professor). Look over the figures in the text. Tests were doable if you went to class, paid attention, and read over your notes to get a thorough understanding of the material. Dr. Currie made the material interesting with practical examples.
Dr. Currie was an amazing teacher to have my first semester. He was very helpful and made the class interesting. I loved his enthusiam and how he get to know each student as an individual. You need to pay attention in class, but as long as you take clear notes, you will be fine, and remember to get help from the TA's. They are a great resource.
Dr. Currie is by far the best professor I had this year. He keeps us interested, he is very confident in what he is teaching, and you can tell he knows what he is talking about. For his tests I would recommend recording his lectures and taking notes, plus reading his pdfs, they are genius and straightforward. He is very quick in answering emails.
Class is very straight forward, if you learn the material and ask questions you'll get the grade you want. Dr. Currie made the material interesting and was obviously very dedicated to teaching us and extremely interested in the subject. This was my favorite class of the semester.
Currie is one of the best professors at Cornell. He is the kind that will be able to call you by name. That should say a lot for a large introductory level class. He really cares about his students. His office hours were great, where you get your own scheduled time slot. The guy is also quite hilarious. I wish I could have taken more of his classes
really inspiring and a clear, interesting lecturer. by far my best professor this semester.
a good class, tests require decent amount of study time.  dont underestimate them.
Currie is an amazing professor. He knows what he is talking about and has a great sense of humor. Hands down he is one of the best professors at Cornell. Great accessibility for office hours; you schedule your own. He actually cares about his students! He has plenty interesting and often entertaining ?old man? stories about his experiences.
Currie was prepared and concise- 'amazing' to sum it up. Excellent professor with a wholehearted interest.Coming from the city, I had very limited experience with the animals at the Teaching Barn- the TAs, notably Jenn and Margeaux, were extremely knowledgeable and helpful, not at all condescending or impatient with my lack of experience+knowledge.
Fill in the blank exams, lots of  funtion and memorizing terms. Currie is a very intelligent professor. He knows everything. and our TAs were awsome too.
very engaging lecturer- explains material well and gives great real-life examples. Exams were very fair, labs were interesting- this is a class everyone at Cornell should take!
Even though I thought Currie's class was difficult, he was an interesting professor.
Dr. Currie is amazing!  The class is really interesting - the applications of biology to real life situations involving animals.  I love Dr. Currie's stories and he really made the class fun. I wish all professors were as passionate about their Intro classes as he is. Labs were great, too!
Currie is the man. He knows his subject very well and enjoys conveying his knowledge to his students. Tests are a bit harder than expected, but still extremely reasonable if you study. Do not leave studying to the last minute, as there is a lot more information on tests than you'll expect. TAs are helpful for this class.
I feel like this is one of the few classes I've taken in my life where I've come away having actually LEARNED something. Overall, I'd say the exams were fair &amp; an accurate representation of what I got out of the material. I like that the labs were both informative &amp; laid-back. Finally, I wish Dr. Currie the best in his retirement! He's earned it
Overall, I felt this was a pretty good class...it was the only class my first semester that I didn't absolutely detest. The labs are the BEST! they are laid back, interesting, and most of the time fun! Also, I really like that if you do well on the midterm, you don't have to take the final!! It's awesome!
This course was terrific. We were taught the basics of all mamillian biological functions. The tests were hard for me but I had little background in Biology. The TA's especially Jenn Ruby &amp; Samantha Schlemmer were always available for clarification of subject matter. Dr Currie taught from experience which made the subject matter easier to understa
Dr, Currie is amazing! He is definitely the best professor that I will ever have! I have learned so much from his class, and I will never forget the things we learned. I especially enjoyed the Teaching Barn experinece, and his daily demonstrations. He is just an overall nice guy who really cares about his students. He will truly be missed.
Dr. Currie is the man.  His tests are tricky but his class is awesome. The labs are fun and interactive.  The necropcy lab as well as the sheep flipping lab are extremely fun. The TAs are awesome as well, especially Margaret, Sarah and Jessica. It is a shame that Dr. Currie is retiring because he's an awesome an extremely knowledgeable professor.
Teacher name: Katzenstein, Peter
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Absolutely loved Katzenstein's class. Even though I am a Hotel student, I took his Intro to IR class in my freshman fall and it is still my favorite class to this date. Would recommend anyone to take a course taught by Katzenstein.
I regret taking this class. All the other hype about PK from the reviews is extremely misplaced. As a junior, I've had much better professors than him. His lectures are irrelevant to the tests (and boring) and you can skip. The amount of reading is atrocious and the sections can barely cover it. The TA's are hard graders as well
An incredible scholar. It was an honor to have been taught by him. His analyses on readings - both simple and dense - provide you with depth and very necessary clarity. This is NOT AN EASY class. You have to be willing to read, read and read! If you are interested in IR, this class is a must. He loves his students and wants everyone to succeed!!!!!
Katzenstein changed my life. This class changes your perspective on the whole world and teaches you to think in a completely new way. PK teaches you to think, read, and write critically. This course is a lot of reading and is challenging, but you will come out of it feeling so rewarded. TAs were all ridiculously smart and extremely helpful.
Didn't know what to expect from this course, having heard all the hubub from its appearance on Fox News, but each lecture left me thoroughly impressed. PK is a great lecturer and brings an interesting perspective to pol. That being said, we need more TAs!!! Sections were way too large and made it difficult to feel comfortable speaking during them.
PK is a fabulous professor, the best I've come across so far at Cornell. He changes the way you perceive the world, doesn't force you to agree with him, has a fabulous sense of humor and teaches you to think critically. I recommend everyone at Cornell to take at least one of his classes. The skills he teaches are useful in practically every field.
Wonderful professor - I appreciated how insightful his lectures were, and how often he gave us a chance to share our thoughts and opinions on a given topic. The material he covered was very interesting, and the readings often pretty thought-provoking. Overall not too difficult of a class, and I definitely appreciate taking it.
This was probably one of the best classes that I've taken in my university career. PK is truly a fantastic professor that invests a lot of thought into designing his classes and knows exactly what he wants students to take away from them. This being said, class would greatly benefit from having more TAs and smaller sections!
He often speaks without a microphone a bit too softly to understand with his accent. When you can hear him though, Professor Katzenstein comes across as an incredibly humble, knowledgeable, and genuinely enthusiastic professor. Makes lots of jokes during lectures, and cares passionately about what he teaches. I learned A LOT in this class.
The course is hard because the material is hard, and he views his students as intelligent and capable, so he has high standards. He is an excellent professor, truly inspiring. He says for the first half of the course lots of things won't make sense and he's right, but by the end he's right that it does make sense and changes world views.
AMAZING CLASS. There's a lot of reading, have never seen so much in my life. However, this class does make you critically think. Everyone at Cornell should take one of his courses. He makes the class fun, even though itll consume a lot of your time. He's also very funny. Great fashion sense, lots to turtlenecks.
one of the most amazing academic experience I have ever had.
This class is truly challenging but rewarding. Definitely expect a lot of readings but I learned how to skim by the end of the semester. PK is very knowledgeable and the classes is very organized. One of the best classes I took at Cornell.
Professor Katzenstein is truly an incredible professor, deserving his fame. Lectures can be dense at times, just like the readings, however, they are still incredibly insightful. The course is an insane undertaking, but if you put in the time, the gains are incredible. PK is also extremely accessible, and office hours are extremely fun and valuable
A lot of hype around PK. As you see by other ratings, people view him as an amazing professor although most all of the teaching happens with your TA. PK even says he's the last resort when you have inquiries, consult every TA first. Lectures lack structure and connection to readings is extremely weak. Readings unreasonably hard for an intro level.
PK made the lectures very interesting and helpful. I found that discussion led by the TA's was the most helpful part of the course and helped explain the readings. The lectures are amazing, but be prepared to read like crazy. If you are willing to put in the work this class will reward you.
Great teacher, great class. If you get the chance, take it, because I learned a lot (but be ready to read a lot for homework). If you do the readings, the class isn't that difficult, definitely not too stressful. You can get away with not buying/reading the Drezner book, but it may help you understand the concepts a little better.
Katzenstein is a wonderful professor, and I greatly enjoyed the time I had taking Intro to IR. The course itself is a very difficult course without question, but it does a good job of paving new ways for you to think and analyze the world. Katzenstein has a great approach of placing students first and being a guide through this course.
PK is the someone I'd want as an interesting grandpa, but not really as a professor. This class is completely different from what I expected of the title (Making Sense of World Politics) I almost feel more confused. It is without a doubt that I've learned a huge amount of material, but how I actually feel about the material is hard to answer :/
PK is a gem. He is a master conversationalist and a gifted speaker. He cares about what you think and isn't afraid to say what he feels. He is biased toward his school of theory, but can provide explanations in many. I can't recommend him enough.
Teacher name: Ruttledge, Thomas
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Loved this professor's class. Really funny, interesting material, and an extremely generous grading curve- it is literally impossible to fail this class. You do need to come to class, since all prelim material is covered in class and there is no textbook. Would recommend for anyone.
What people say about his lectures are true. I came here to warn you-- don't bother with the textbook. His mechanisms contradict with the textbook's (and every other online source for that matter) and he docks points for drawing alternative (but correct) mechanisms. He basically lives in his own world of chemistry. Good luck with this class.
Go to Class! All tests are based entirely on the lecture notes &amp; the class grade entirely off of 2 prelims &amp; a final. Overall I just showed up to class, PAID ATTENTION, studied maybe 1-2hr for each prelim, &amp; got an A- w curve. Professor Ruttledge is super passionate &amp; really really nice. Does his best to make the material less dense. Fav prof. LOVE
PRAY TO GOD NOT TO GET THIS PROFESSOR EVER AGAIN!!!!
Makes a 2 credit intro organic chemistry lab course way more work than it needs to be. Felt like lectures were always behind schedule and that there was a huge discontinuity between what was going on during the lab sections and what was going on in class. I don't care what you did in Ghana or Paris, I care about learning the material.
Omg i love this professor!!! I wish more professors had his intense personality. For some reason the way he teaches boosted my confidence a lot. He makes things so clear and straightforward and I don't feel dumb. Not at all arrogant. I felt alive and happy in his class. Better experience with him than the other chemistry professors.
I did not enjoy this class at all. If you're not a solid chem student, Professor Rutledge will make you feel like an idiot. He is very arrogant. I personally did not like his teaching style at all. He can be funny, but he is full of himself. I do not recommend at all.
On the first lecture, Tom will have a pep talk on how to do well in the class, office hours. A good amount of people show up to his first few but only a handful end up going regularly. Be one of those few that go consistently, it's a great way to stay on top of the material, and he is the nicest most sincere person who will make sure you learn orgo
I had Tom for CHEM 2510 and CHEM 3580 in the same semester. He teaches the material very clearly, but sometimes digresses to tell you about his latest trip to Paris or tell you a joke about his mom. However, I think he does that to keep your attention. He will test you on conceptual knowledge and not memorization. Overall, he was a great professor.
Hard professor. Exams had little to do with that he talked about in class. Had to teach myself everything. Had little to no respect for his students.
Enthusiastic orgo professor who loves soap and telling jokes during class. He should have been a comedian as a side career. Overall difficult class but I felt like I learned a lot despite mixed reviews from other students. His exams were designed for less memorization and more for challenging student's knowledge and giving them novel problems.
Tom does not believe in easy. He wants student to work hard for their grade, and it shows. He tries to help student by being tough but sometimes it backfires. The grading of the class rests on the TA mostly. Don't worry about the practical because there will be a review session and lots of extra help. It is also helpful to take 3580 for the final.
I really thought I'd be the last person to like organic chemistry, but Tom made me love it. He's brilliant, funny, engaging, and loves to teach. He's so passionate about all things, and I loved his tangents about travel and politics. I used the think I wasn't capable in science until Tom taught it the way it should be taught. Difficult but worth it
Engaging lecturer. Practical and final exam were very difficult, but reasonable. I appreciated the focus on understanding WHY rather than pure memorization of the material. I found office hours helpful, though he makes you work for answers. I feel like he really cares about students and their success, but certainly wants to challenge them.
This man gives good exams that actually test your understanding of the material rather than regurgitating exams from past years. In reality there are only a handful of mechanisms he can ask, so it shouldn't be an issue for someone who's taken 2 semesters of orgo already. If you've only taken 3570 then it's a little extra work but pays off in 3580.
Everything was fine until the final. There isn't really a textbook so if you skip the lectures and miss the mechanisms you're screwed. He likes to hear himself talk but he can be pretty funny. TAs are chill and just as frustrated with Tom as students were. Office hours were not too helpful, he didn't seem to want to give any straight answers.
He is one of the worst professors I have ever had.
It is absolute that you have to take this course after taking 2510 or otherwise you will suffer from two lab periods week and more challenging labs. But still 3010 was much more fun than 2510. Less competitive and relaxed atmosphere with much more interesting and engaging experiments. More skilled TAs and less people in the lab.
Annoying. Not necessary to have both a lab practical and a final but regardless neither of them were too difficult.
Dr. Ruttledge is extremely self-absorbed, which bothered me on a personal level. HOWEVER, he does give engaging lectures, and he knows his stuff. Lab practical will make you poo yourself because its somewhat out of your control. Final is not that hard if you actually study the lab mechanisms. I got an A on it and I'm an avgbelow avg chem student
Teacher name: Terrell, Maria
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
If you're good at math take Maria Terrell, if not find another professor.
WORST professor I had for Math, ever! Highly opinionated and does not listen.
She was very enthusiastic about the material.  The material was pretty hard but the tests were straightforward.
She's a genius, but VERY disorganized prof. She had us use her unfinished textbook for Multi. That meant it was free, but also devoid of examples and not very helpful. Lectures were also disorganized, and discussions didn't help much. I passed the class thanks to her easy grading, but didn't learn the material. She's nice but I don't recommend.
Don't judge her according to the scores on this site. Professor Terrell is one of the best professors I've ever met at Cornell. She teaches me not only knowledge but also ways to think and how math is related to science. Prelims and finals are OK if you review all homework problems. Yes, she does seem a little weird, but it makes her lecture fun.
She was friendly, helpful, and always willing to give time to explain something. Tests were difficult, but fair. She inspired me to become a math major, and her lectures were incredible.
Dr. Terrell was one of the best profs I've had here so far. She was extremely committed to making sure you understood the material. Office hours were an incredible resource. You can tell she really cares about her students. She was trying out the textbook she was writing, so we got free printouts.
She was trying out a new book that she was writing, which was still a bit rough in some spots. She had a way of making complicated ideas more approachable and had a somewhat eccentric sense of humor.
Both my roommate and I had Maria for Math 1920. The vast majority of lectures are spent on theories that aren't that relevant to the core elements of the course. I would say that only 5% of the lecture topics actually appeared on tests and there is a terrible curve.
Professor Terrell was not helpful to me. One time in office hours, she made me wait 20 minutes so that she could finish writing a review about herself on this site. In the end, I passed the class thanks to the Calc I tutoring sessions done by another professor.
Ineffective lecturer. She struggles to make sense and gets on too many irrelevant tangents. Sometimes she goes over time without any consideration for those of us who have to get to another class.
Dr. Terrell is the best math professor I've had so far at Cornell. She really wants her students to understand the subject and puts a lot of effort into making the concepts more intuitive. She does a lot of examples in lecture that follow clearly to the homework. It's still the Cornell math department though, so tests are hard.
Awful lectures. Maria seems to be more committed to writing fake reviews on this board than to improve her teaching skills. Catch her offguard in office hours and you will see. Tests are somewhat fair. The worst part is the textbook which doesn't provide good examples.
This professor made learning multivariable calculus fun, stress free, and manageable. Her personality animated the lectures and she was a VERY good explainer. Great class. No complaints.
Really eccentric but one of the best lecturers I've had at Cornell. She really makes an effort to explain the math concepts instead of just writing down equations or doing constant proofs and theorems like 1910. Exams were okay except the final which was killer. She's not perfect but as far as 1920 is concerned she's fantastic at teaching it all.
Some complain that the tests are hard but that is not the case at all. I've compared her tests to those set by other professors who've taught the class. Her questions were easy and a straightforward application of the concepts, whereas other professors' required many layers of depth and demanded thorough understanding. Just pay attention in class.
Probably my favorite lecturer thus far. The material is hard but she does a great job coming up with simplified versions that are easy to understand. She is quite entertaining as well. I didn't always take notes in class because, being honest, sometimes I barely made it to 11 am class on Friday but just sitting in class was enough to learn a lot.
Terrell is very quirky but that makes lectures more interesting than they otherwise would be. Emphasizes geometry and thinking about a problem rather than following the same steps for each one. Prelims are reasonable and corrections are very helpful.
I really enjoyed 1920 with Terrell. Her lectures are clear and organized. She make s the class enjoyable with her quirky examples, and she adds some jokes here and there. If you put in some effort  you'll end up with a good grade!
An amazing professor who truly cares about how well her students learn the material and how they do in the class.
Teacher name: Chirik, Paul
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Awesome lecturer. He actually made gen chem fun which I thought was impossible. Great guy!
Good overall
paul is an amazing professor.  his lectures were like chapters - each one with key developments and players.  his exams were difficult, but fair, and he was very willing to assist on hw granted you attend office hours.  he's friendly and funny and an organized, clear and effective lecturer.  he can be patient - but he expects a high level of effort
Chem was always a problem for me, until I heard about this great prof, Paul Chirik.  He made some of the most difficult areas very easy to understand.  Great instructor.
A couple years out, I now realize he is just an entertainer, not an scholar. Hopefully he matures into a real educator some day.
He is hot and a great teacher. Sure his tests are hard, but he makes you think and grades fairly at the end.
Great professor. Very clear and very funny. I loved going to class cuz Chirik was interactive and friendly and the material was interesting. One of the best lecturers I have seen. If you want to learn chemistry (thermo, kinetics, etc.) start with chem 215, esp with Chirik.
Definitely the best professor I've ever had.  I never wanted to miss a class because they were so fun.  The exams and problem sets are hard though, but he makes the class totally worth it! Also the class is "chemistry according to Paul Chirik" so you don't have to read the book!
Chirik's lectures are a blast... literally. However, the quality of the lesson could be better. Hes absolutely adorable and really funny though. Everyone loves him.
Good professor.  Very funny.  His tests were okay, learned a lot in this class.
Great professor, amazing lecturer, and great class.  He really made me interested in chemistry.  Tests are very difficult, but fair in general.  He seemed to become more patient with answering questions towards the end of the semester.
Chirik has a great passion for chemistry and relates what he's teaching to reality.  His tests are very difficult, but they push a student to do their best and then get better.  Chirik expects students to work hard and think and act like scientists.
A funny teacher, but sometimes takes time from class telling jokes and goes off topic. The demonstrations are always fun and his sense of humor keeps students awake in the morning. The labs for the class are hard and the tests are even harder, but the curve is generous. However, intense studying is required and the problem sets are sometimes hard.
Great personality - cracks a lot of jokes and keeps class interesting, resorting to his humor and many usually awesome demos.  Does a decent job teaching the material, though it isn't always clear.  TA &amp; office hours help alot.  Workload is reasonable, but prelims are rather difficult.  It's a good class.
Problem sets can be daunting, TA office hours are incredibly helpful. Problem sets are often not as hard as they appear, sometimes just weirdly worded. Funny guy during class, keeps it interesting. Sometimes doesn't give examples which makes it hard to know how to apply some information, but generally a good professor.
Problem sets were confusing, exams even more so. Lectures mostly consist of him deriving formulas on the board. This class convinced me not to major in chemistry.
Umm... I enjoyed the lectures while i was still in this class. They were really fun and interesting. His prelim was seriously ridiculously hard and because of it I dropped to 207 in the middle of the semester. He doesn't exactly teach for a test so even if  you think you understand the information you still could have a problem on the prelim.
This guy is the best freshman prof I have had.
awesome personality. really makes the lectures informative, scientific but every understandable for the student. take notes. go to lecture. go to office hours once in awhile, especially before prelims/final.
Chem isn't gonna be easy unless you're already good at it. Chirik is really funny and is a good lecturer but dont let his charming personality fool you, the class is still difficult. Go to every lecture and take good notes.
Teacher name: Fan, Daisy
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Lectures were pretty good but get ready to spend hours on the projects. Projects are definitely do-able, just time-consuming. Be wary.
I had minimal cs experience going into this class but Daisy WILL teach you how to code by the time you come out. She is easily one of the kindest, most compassionate and caring professors who will do everything she can to help you succeed. The projects can be overwhelming and terrifying but if you do them the tests are VERY fair and manageable.
A great lecturer who really helps give comprehensive insight on the material. This was my first ever computer science course, and while the material was difficult at times, it was a rewarding experience to go through. She provides the textbook online for free and keeps lectures interactive with clicker questions as well.
While she is one of more empathetic and caring professors on this campus, the course itself gave me a lot of anxiety. It never felt like a intro class to me because too many people who had coding experience and they were are the only ones getting high grades. The class was hard and deflated as 92 was a B+. If you value your grade take python.
I really love her class. The lecture is delivered super clear in a detailed way. She's very humorous and the class is very attractive. I really learned a lot during the class. Though the assignment can be quite challenging sometimes.
Clear lecturer and very open to helping students outside of class. The course is a very standard intro programming course, doesn't really teach specific features of MATLAB. I learned the most from projects, but lectures were also helpful. Additional resources like the recommended reading and discussions were slightly less important to me.
Such a passionate and energetic woman. Absolutely love her. Her lectures are clear and organized, and she is very approachable outside of class.
She's a nice lady. The projects can get lengthy towards the end. The tests weren't too hard, but they would take off for the most insignificant things. Make sure to look over their rating on prelims, they messed up on both of mine and I got some points back.
Intro CS classes can be tough because some people know how to code, others don't. Some people can pick it up easily, others don't. While I found her lectures interesting, the assignments I found impossible because the lectures were not directly related to the assignments. I spent 20-25 hours every other week in office hours in order to complete hw.
I took this class with absolutely no coding experience and it was extremely hard in the beginning. This class is an absurd mix of students with no experience and students who've been coding for years. It takes some time and lots of practice (give urself time for the projects!!!!) but Daisy really will teach u how to code and succeed if u stick w it
You have to go to class because she does clicker questions. Also, the code discussed in class is very likely to show up on the prelims. Sometimes her pacing is a little wonky (both too fast and too slow), but the discussion sections help you get over that lapse. Overall, she's a pretty fun professor and I would take her again.
The projects will be the best way to learn the material, and sometimes she speaks softly.
I really appreciated Daisy's effort she put in to her lectures. It definitely felt like she knew what she was talking about and tried to convey the relevant stuff. She was also incredibly helpful in office hours, and I couldn't have done the projects without her help.
I came into this class with no prior CS experience which made it very challenging. Considering that Daisy has to lecture to such as wide range of skill, she does a pretty good job. I learned a lot in this class, but definitely focus more on studying for exams considering they are worth nearly 3/4 of your course grade.
Great class.  She is an amazing teacher who takes the time to walk thoroughly through even the simplest of concepts (if you're paying attention.)  I came into the class with no CS background and now am considering CS as my major.  Be prepared to work your ass off when the projects come around!
She is a great lecturer!  The projects were difficult and took insane amounts of time, but the exams were never as bad as the projects
Tests are fair. Projects are a lot of work. If you have background experience in programming this class will be easier, which explains the amount of people that gave this class a 1 in difficulty.
CS 1112 is a difficult class but Daisy is a great lecturer
Daisy Fan has really basic lectures. Her book for cs1112 barely helps. Lecture recordings available online, which is good. Discussions are helpful. However, her projects are going to murder you. Expect zero hours of work some weeks and 20 hours when there are projects due. Don't take 112 if you can take 110. Easy if you have a cs background.
I feel bad for Her. She has to teach an intro CS class so kids who have been coding since 2 yrs don't get 100s and kids who have never coded don't get 0s. Daisy obviously fails &amp; the poor kids who needed it most come out with a horrid grade and hatred for CS. Cornell needs to create a different class for the kids who already have a basis in coding
Teacher name: Perez, Pedro
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great teacher. We had to write a lot, but you get used to it.
If you are not a hard worker, you will not perform well in the course. There are a ton of cases, and they actually are pretty intellectually challenging. Perez himself is incredibly smart, but you really have to attentively listen to him to understand the depth of his lectures. I highly recommend participating as much as you can in this course.
The weekly cases (sometimes 2 or 3 a week) can make the class seem so long. Study the previous lecture for the quizzes. Lecture heavy. The final group presentation project isnt bad, just have to have an understanding of the case. Not a bad class overall, can be on your laptop.
At the end of the semester, he even refused to tell you your overall score, such as participation grade. Even though he taught nothing in class, he is a very tough grader, and cares nothing about the students' feeling. This is the worst experience that I have ever had in Cornell. Cornell really should find another prof.
Professor Perez radiates passion and vigour. He inspires his students to think analytically about business cases. He entertains as well as teaches, and often jumps vigorously on and off tables in a melodramatic fashion. One learns a lot from his classes. A great professor but one who may not always give his undivided attention to his students.
Prof. Perez enjoys what he lectures and tries to make seemingly-superficial material relevant. The course was somewhat disorganized, but Perez was very accommodating. As long as you do all the work, the class should be fine.
Took this class on a Friday afternoon for about 2 hours. Fantastic discussions regarding ethics and a bit of philosophy with interesting cases. Graded on reflections which are fairly short.
The majority of my work that semester was from his class (case studies and 2 large projects). The quizzes were literally impossible, and reading the chapters they were supposedly based on didn't help. However I  managed to get an A in the class so looking back I'm okay with it. Take advantage of all extra credit and try to participate in class.
You do not really learn that much in lecture, and the quizzes in class can be tough, but overall everyone does well and it is a great first business class at the Dyson School.
One legit question on a quiz he gave us is "Is quality expensive?" (Answer was somehow 'false') Studying for the many tests is almost useless since he will ask the most arbitrary irrelevant questions just to make sure no one gets 100. He's pretty passionate/animated about his subject, but it gets in the way of letting the lectures be clear.
Smart guy but very unclear in what he expects for assignments.
Overall a fine class, but the information presented is utterly irrelevant. My biggest and probably only problem with this class is that he doesn't tell you what he wants and relies too much on the TA's who don't really help at all. But bottom line, as long as you show up you're pretty much guaranteed a B.
Pedro's class is not very straightforward in terms of his expectations or material that is covered. That being said, I did poorly on my prelims, but still ended up with a good grade because I went to class and got all of the extra credit opportunities. Not a great class experience while you're in it but you will be surprised with your grade
Pedro is a a below average professor. His lectures are incoherent, and the class provides you with such minimal information about different areas of business that I left each class without having learned much. His teaching assistants grade unfairly at times and are not the nicest people. I was not impressed or happy with this class or professor.
easy A+ as it is
Get an easier TA! Quizzes are often a surprise, mostly based off of power points, that at times doesn't make complete sense. Participation is needed but pointless as the same idiotic loud students take over the discussions.
The quizzes were, at times, very arbitrary. Perez lacks organization in his lectures at times. The TA grading is subjective and Perez often has mood swings. He is a nice guy though; he will answer questions after class. This class requires a significant time commitment. Make sure to spend a lot of time on the final project.
Horribly confusing tests, useless class, a complete waste of time. Do not take AEM 1200 unless you have to.
Can't stand him
He is extremely passionate about his subject.  His quizzes are fairly difficult, especially if you don't read the textbook.  Also, TA grading can be fairly subjective.  I highly recommend going to TA office hours to talk about cases.  Overall a great and informative class!  Pedro knows a lot and is willing to share if you speak with him.
Teacher name: Curtis, Richard
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
This class was maddeningly tedious
Put in the work and you will do well. Curtis is a great professor when you get to know him and his teaching style. If youre willing to work hard and seek out help if youre struggling, Curtis will help you succeed; no other professor holds extra office hours late into the night (around midnight) the week before the exam. Highly recommend
This course taught me that there is more to life than high finance.
Terrible class, Curtis emphasizes memorization over concepts...
Professor Curtis is the only professor who refuses to take student questions during lectures. Let that sink in.
Strict professor and very disorganized lectures
This class was an absolute waste of time. Disorganized lectures, little guidance, and a moody professor. Take the finance course offered by the hotel school.
If you think the 40-paged syllabus is excessive, you're going to think this entire course is excessive.
Do not take this class if you have any interest in learning about finance.
Go to his review lectures, they will save you hours of cumbersome lectures throughout the semester. But if you really want to save some valuable time, take a different finance class.
His lectures are some of the most sleep inducing ordeals I have had to deal with at Cornell and he makes it worse by shaming you if you're not attentive. Considering that I only have this issue with this class, I wonder whose fault this really is.
He knows magic tricks. His most famous trip is making the class fall asleep.
He has a quick exam turn over, only good thing I can say about Prof. Curtis.
The ridiculous course packet, the ridiculous videos, ridiculous exams, the ridiculous lectures, and his ridiculous attitude make this a ridiculous class.
An OK teacher that seems to care about his lectures, but it seems to be more about the way he displays himself rather actual care for students. Very unapproachable.
This was by far the worst course in the Dyson minor. Anyone interesting in learning about finance should avoid this class.
If you're shopping for finance classes to take for the business minor, I would not recommend this class. It's a lot of busy work and the professor is not very helpful or clear in lectures.
I cannot fathom why anyone would willingly subject themselves to this course willingly.
This class is awful. Avoid!
Unfair grading, exam, and lecture policies make this course extremely inconvenient. Lectures in a disorganized and unprepared fashion, worrying more about who he can get in trouble rather than the dissemination of knowledge. I probably learned more about course logistics from this class than I did finance. I would not recommend him or his class.
Teacher name: Gries, David
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Gries is a very experienced professor, with a strong reputation throughout Cornell CS. He provides many resources to succeed in his class: good powerpoints, practice tests, handouts, piazza answers, and TA lectures make this class very manageable with some effort. The prelims aren't too hard if you use the practice exams, and the final is optional.
Prof. Gries is an amazing professor! He explains the material well in lecture, and it's neat to see his personal touch on programming topics, including a surprising amount of history. Let him know if you are struggling: he is kind, willing to help, and cares about students as people. Go to lecture.
Gries is a solid professor. I learned an immense amount about OO-programming and data structures from the course. Prelims and the final project account for most of your grade in the course (particularly prelim 2). Very helpful in office hours. He is very knowledgable and has worked with some of the world's best computer scientists.
Sometimes confusing and can be rude when you try to ask questions on Piazza. He gets the information through, but lectures are not terribly interesting and he is very particular about certain things.
Boring lectures, useless ppt decks, not sure what he is doing on class.
Amazing professor with great lectures. He tells you exactly what you need to know more clearly and concisely than any other professor I've had. Some things can be unclear if you learn them on your own so try to pay attention and follow along in lecture if you can.
Snippy when it comes to answering questions (online), but his answers try to encourage independent student learning; don't expect a polite answer if you ask about something that you can google/check the course materials for yourself.
Very approachable outside of class. Not a hard course if you've taken CS 1110
He knows what he's doing. Your grade is basically based on the two prelims but you also have to do well on the assignments. The final is optional, and if you don't take it you just get the grade you have thus far, which is nice.
I really enjoyed the class. I know a lot of students skip lectures, but I found his lectures to be very useful and representative of the knowledge needed for the prelims. If you do well on the first two prelims, Gries lets you skip the final and take your grade as it is.
terrible professor, rapid unhelpful lectures, very arrogant and rude. projects hurt you but they cant help, only grades that matter are the two prelims and if u do poorly on one that's probably the grade u wil get
Gries is incredibly caring and genuinely interested in helping his students. He can be quite sassy on Piazza, which can annoy some students, but I personally thought it was hilarious and gave him personality. Regardless, he is an engaging and humorous lecturer and is very willing to help you if you ask for it.
Gries is the most caring professor I have seen in Cornell. He makes lots of efforts to help students learn from this lecture. Some of assignments and prelims are challenging though, he and George respond to the questions on piazza efficiently. Go to his OH! It's super helpful, and you will find how patient he is going to teach you.
Professor Gries is one of the most caring professors. His lecture slides are well-written, and he provides student opportunities to have lunch with him. The workload is fairly light and the prelims are reasonable. His lectures are pretty good and he answers almost every piazza question super fast.
Tough class and the lectures were not overly engaging/interesting. Still, Professor Gries knows his work very well and pioneered the field of loop invariants. TAs were helpful even though they graded pretty harshly.
Lectures were pretty interesting. Projects were short and overall the class wasn't that much work.
He's one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He has such extensive knowledge about the subject and is always ready to help. He is easily accessible outside the class. He can come across as a bit condescending if you ask "dumb" questions but ignore that.
The professor was really great! He was helpful and responsive! He replied Piaaza questions very quickly.
Class was very difficult and lectures were little to no help for assignments and prelims. Final is optional which is good, but can hurt you if you choose to take it.  Prelim medians were very difficult making the median very low, but the way Gries curves the class is somewhat confusing. Hardest class I've ever taken.
The exams make up the majority of your grade. When doing the assignments, make sure you REALLY know what you're doing, and understand what's going on if you're working with a partner.
Teacher name: Ganem, Bruce
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great lecturer!
Interesting material, great delivery in lecture, tons of help from many sources out of class (himself, TAs, CHEM 1057, tutors). Make sure you do as many problems as you can get your hands on, both from the text and from the old prelims that he gives you to study from.
He's definitely a nice guy and tries to learn people's names. His tests are also very fair- he doesn't test you on what he doesn't teach. His lectures are also very straightforward and keeps you paying attention. Only downside is that he's not that clear when answering questions... more of the watch you until you figure it out type.
Ganem is easily one of the best professors I've had at Cornell. He's caring, accommodating towards the demands of college, and an incredible lecturer. His lectures are easy to follow, clear, and organized. Study his lecture notes religiously and keep up with the material and you will do fine on his exams, they're fair and mostly straight-forward.
Prof Ganem is very clear lecturer and genuinely cares about his students. Orgo is hard because of how it's graded but the subject matter itself is not very difficult and there were no surprises on prelims. Questions are very much taken from concepts learned in lecture so go and pay attention-- he doesn't upload notes online-- and you'll be fine.
Definitely attend lectures and do practice and assigned sapling, and you will do well. I always enjoyed his lectures (but less so towards the end of the semester with IR and NMR topics). CHEMM 1570 with Jane Walcott was also very helpful
I struggled in chem2070/80. I was very worried about taking orgo due to everything that I had heard. Prof Ganem is THE man! Even though the material is HARD, his lectures are SO clear and he really wants you to succeed and understand WHY things are happening. If you stay up on your readings and go to lecture, you will be good! Exams are very fair.
Ganem is the worst professor I have had at Cornell. He is a rude and arrogant professor who only favors a select few. Very unfair and poor lecturer.
Bruce Ganem is a brilliant man who is enthusiastic about Orgo. I can appreciate him as a professor, but I truly hated this course. It's incredibly difficult and the pace is super quick. There is a very competitive nature in this class and once you stop understanding something, you get left behind.
Professor Ganem is, simply put, the best professor I've had at Cornell, period. The man is a genius, and he truly is passionate about Orgo and teaching. His lectures are crystal clear, but this is still a difficult course. Lots of studying is required to succeed. However, Professor Ganem makes it all an enjoyable experience. I recommend him fully
Ganem is by far the best chemistry professor Cornell has to offer in my view after taking Gen Chem 1 and 2 and Orgo 1. Out of all chemistry professors I've taken he is the most innately brilliant and teaches in the most organized and understandable way , but is also very personable. I say this even after receiving a lower grade in the course.
OK guys I screwed up big time in his class. I got overconfident on the first exam since I got an A-, then was putting off studying, and fell behind immensely. I don't know how I didnt get an F honestly. He's a great teacher but I made huge mistakes.
Very clear and easy to follow notes. Difficult class, but he makes it as bearable as possible. Look over his notes for the exam, they help  simplify the book
One of the most intelligent and straight-forward professors in Cornell. His lectures are always at comprehensive level. His tests are very hard if you do not spend enough time on the orgo studying. Talking with Ganem will be your most interesting experience if you get closer with him. Dr. Ganem will make Chem 3570 interesting for you.
Probably one of the most straight-forward teachers I have ever had! He teaches the information at a very comprehensible level, and he is a very nice teacher. His lectures follow very closely with the textbook, which helps with understanding. As long as you study, go to lectures, and read the textbook, tests are very fair!
He's a good lecturer despite the fact that he can breeze over topics sometimes. His tests are pretty straight forward and fair. He doesn't post the notes online either so go to lecture and skim the textbook.
A good lecturer but somewhat impatient if you go to him for easy questions. But he is really an expert and prepared for all hard questions that students have. So get the insight for orgo and go to his office hour. He will be very passionate and nice if you have good questions. However normally students still struggle.
Professor Ganem's lectures were always very clear and his exams corresponded exactly to what was taught in lecture. They were very fair if you listened and followed. Aside from that, Ganem was very accessible and helpful during office hours if there was ever something specific I didn't understand
Was clear about his lectures. Exams are fair if you study.
Lectures are dull but he's organized and clear. Nice guy. The type you'd go bowling with.
Teacher name: Hines, Melissa
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Not horrible class. Topics are more abstract then in 2070 (except MO theory) so I found the content harder to begin with. Hines is a clear lecturer and exams are VERY close to the practice ones (almost identical prelim 1). Don't pay attention to group quizzes for prelim studying. asks questions in ways you must fully understand material to answer.
Hines's lectures are structured, organized, and well-prepared. The group quizzes are hard, especially if your group is incompetent, but the prelims are fair game so long as you pay attention in lecture, take notes, keep up with the material, and at least attempt the group quizzes. The course is challenging but rewarding if you put in the effort.
Lectures and Learning Catalytics are critically important to understand and grasp the concepts and ideas. Group Quizzes are a little more challenging but help you to master these concepts. Prelims are tricky but everything you need to know is either said by her or written as notes. Only a few TAs are helpful. Review notes daily and practice.
In all honestly, the material was not difficult, but Hines made sure that the level of difficulty was challenging. I used the textbook religiously and made my own problem sets. The group quizzes were tedious and usually way above the level that would get tested on prelims. Know how to apply the content and LCs were helpful!
An overall nice class. If you put in the work you will get the results you want. Prelims questions are not necessarily hard but just hard to understand. Study old tests and lecture notes. Read textbook like its your bible for prelim 1 and prelim 2. For the final start early and religious study lecture notes and do prac final.
There are no lecture materials available outside of class, and her writing is very difficult to understand and translate into notes quickly before it gets erased. Group quizzes are a great way to guarantee that each student masters about 25% of a given week's material.
There are group quizzes every week, which are monstrously long and contain questions that take more time to decipher the meaning of than to actually do. The tests are extremely difficult, with low class averages. General chemistry is not a difficult subject, but this class makes it difficult.
The class itself isn't bad. Lab work is manageable. Her lecture style makes it impossible for me to learn. Her TAs are clueless so you'll constantly be lost. Prelims are impossible and I'm beyond screwed for the final. You'll have weekly group quizzes and they are absolutely horrific. An overall frustrating class.
The lectures are fine, group quizzes are okay, but you can get screwed by who is in your group. Also, the prelims are not representative AT ALL of the caliber of questions we get exposed to. Finally, if you miss a lecture and don't have a friend in the class -- you're screwed. The lecture material can only be found in the lecture itself.
There was a clear divide between the students who were naturally inclined in chemistry, and those who needed to work to understand the material, who were left in the dust. When I went to her office hours she told me "I have 800 students and will never remember you". The material and tests are extremely difficult no matter how hard you study.
Professor Hines is by far my favorite professor thus far at Cornell. It was clear that she dedicated a lot of time to organizing her class. Her lectures were remarkably clear, engaging, and purposeful. I liked the concept of group quizzes every week, but I was extremely lucky with my group since we all helped each other understand.
The quizzes are hard and so are the labs but the labs definitely get better. Harder than 2070 content was, but good class. If you work through the problem sets on your own you will be good, and if you don't, then make sure you understand every single solution on the answer key. USE the textbook as a resource to grasp keywords, and concepts.
By far, the most organized, clear, and prepared professor I've had. She is exceptionally clear about what you need to know, and she's more concise than the book. She frequently throws in funny anecdotes or relevant medical applications. Labs force you to think and group quizzes are brutal, but compared to 2070, the class is much less demanding.
Wow, what a course. This class is VERY hard, especially if you have a limited chem background like myself. That being said, it is not impossible if you utilize every resource possible. Hines is amazing, helpful, and super kind. Get ready to work hard and take a lighter schedule with this class. The problem sets can be RIDIC
Hines is a great professor! She is super nice and actually cares about the students. She understands that most kids in her class are biopremed students so she did a lot of examples relating to chemistry applications in medicine. This wasn't an easy class, but she wasn't out there to get you like other professors sometimes try to do.
One of the best professors I've had! Great lecturer that gives real life examples based on materials being learned in class. Very generous with exams and curve. Very helpful when you go to office hours. Bad points: group quizzes that TAs are not allowed to help on. If you're stuck with a stupid group and a harsh TA, you're out of luck.
Hines is a great lecturer I believe who explains everything very well. I opened the textbook once or twice throughout the semester; she is clear on what you should know. I only hated having group quizzes, but if you can do them mostly then you'll be fine for prelims. Learning catalytics is very helpful and good to review 4 prelims. Curves generous.
Good professor, class is challenging but curve is generous. Group quizzes can be hit or miss depending on your group especially since TA's won't help you.
Favorite Professor of Freshman Year! Lectures are incredibly clear and loved learning catalytics test questions. The Problem Sets are extremely hard and the lab is tough but thought her tests were very fair.
Hines obviously wants her students to succeed, and her lectures are helpful and fairly easy to follow. The prob sets (aka group quizzes) were usually very hard, and the labs were challenging. The group quizzes can bring your grade up, but if you're too embarrassed to ask the strangers in your group how they did a prob, you can get left behind.
Teacher name: Callister, John
School name: Cornell University

Teacher comments: 
exams are pretty difficult and can be hard if you dont attend lectures
His lectures are pretty good and you really need to go because he doesn't post answers to the problems he does in class and you have to do them the exact same way for homework and exams. Grading is really tough if you don't do it the same way.
The professor goes off on tangents during lectures a lot and is condescending and doesn't answer questions on Piazza when asked about a simple topic. Also, the lectures are really boring and aren't worth going to.
Cares for his students. Reasonably clear lecturer. Small mistakes will lose you a lot of points on homework and exams.
Callister is a really nice guy. He is open to questions and gives a lot of examples during class to help you study. Very enthusiastic and incorporates personal stories in class.
Best class I've taken at Cornell. Love going to lecture
Dry humor. Tests are easy but curved. It'll be hard to get anything higher than or lower than an A.
He is one of the best if not the best prof I've had at Cornell. do the readings before class,  go to class, do the homework to get an A. Paying attention in class usually clears up the topics you found confusing. in class exercises are super helpful. I'm not even an engineer. I took the class because I like cars and I got an A. material isn't hard.
The class is very easy, especially compared to other freshman engineering classes. Show up to class and go over the material before prelims and you should be fine. Only had 3 homework assignments and one easy group project the whole semester.
Math level needed for homework is algebra, easy. Lectures are interesting bc he uses current examples. Some were upset with questions on prelim but they Were in the reading that he assigns. Straightforward class, easy to get an A if you pay attention, maybe without doing so as well. Not curved.
Interesting entrepreneurship class. The takeaways from the class were constructing a good business plan, and basic accounting and business skills.
An "easy" elective for ORIE majors who want a class with no work, but a class with tons of work for budding entrepreneurs like me. Useless cases, pointless Q &amp; A's to submit for these cases, WHICH ARE 20% OF THE GRADE! He gives the answers to these in class (spends the whole lecture doing so). If he likes you, you do well. Otherwise, you're doomed.
Good guy with a dry sense of humor that I happen to find funny. He was more than willing to answer questions in office hours. Can be a bit blunt sometimes if you ask him a question that he thinks is too easy. Lectures sometimes got boring but that is the nature of Accounting.
Callister is the funniest professor I've had at Cornell. He's got a dry sense of humor though, so it doesn't appeal to everyone. This is one of those classes where if you put the work in, you will do well.  Go to class for his examples. They're very helpful. If you think you'll miss some classes, I'd recommend getting Take Note.
Teaches probly the most practical courses in orie - and does it well. Easy class if u go to classes and take notes. Very funny, nice and helpful. Best lecturer in cornell engr.
ENGINEERING ENTREPRENEURSHIP - go to classes. take notes. ask questions and be ready to answer questions. MAKE SURE TO COME UP WITH A CREATIVE BUSINESS PLAN!! dont try to be safe and come up with a mediocre business idea. creativity = guaranteed A
He's good, take his class, you wont regret it. He funny too.
Wonderful. Knows exactly how to deliver information to a class of tired, overwhelmed engineering student. All I had to do was go to class, write down his neatly written and detailed notes, and enjoy his wacky sense of humor. Oh, and do the homework. Class was a piece of cake. First A+ I've ever received in an engineering course, anyway...
Absolutely worst professor had in Cornell. Impatient and not helpful in office hour.Took 2 classes, accounting is easy but asked u to buy a $200 book never used. Entrepreneur is a joke, taught nothing at all. Just because our group didn't go with his idea, he gave us D for every presentation no.  He DOES treat you like dirt if he doesn't like u.
Best Lecturer I've had.  If you go to class you won't need to read the book at all.  Highly recommended.
Teacher name: Levitsky, David
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Material is interesting, but poorly explained. Lecture contradicts itself. Exams have &gt;10% mis-worded questions that are removed. Prior exams provided w/ incorrect answers, yet unchanged. Answers for test changed w/o notice. Prof thinks anecdotal is same as antidotal. Lectures excluded from Blackboard b/c of errata, but used in exam. Bush-league.
Yes, it is true that he is funny and engaging. It's unfortunate that his lectures are biased and promote unhealthy eating behaviors. He does not promote body positivity (or even body neutrality) and his class is known to lead many towards disordered eating. If you're going to take this class, be wary of his overlooked biases and manipulated data.
By far my favorite professor. He is so funny and also an understanding professor. I looked forward to going to lecture. Sometimes they were exciting, but they could also be bland depending on the topic. Taking the supplemental class was also very helpful.
Great professor, if your go to class and study decently you should be able to do well. Multiple opportunities for extra credit.  Very nice guy, and is super passionate about his field. 100% recommend.
Prof. Levitsky is not only an expert in his field in obesity and nutrition but also a passionate, hilarious professor. His lectures were inspiring. NS1150 material is not difficult but very comprehensive and you would need to know a great amount of details. Very time consuming but his lectures are hilarious.
I never went to lecture
Puts up all lectures online, very specific slides,  Tests are a little annoying since they consist of over 100 T/F questions. Overall great class, I learned a lot.
One of my favorite classes at Cornell! The class is well organized and Levitsky is so  interesting!
Prof. Levitsky is GREAT. His lectures are funny and informative. He offers rebuttal opportunities after exams, and genuinely wants you to learn and care about your health as it relates to nutrition. Also, the TAs are incredibly helpful and always accessible. I am in ILR, and am so happy I chose this class as my science &amp; technology distribution.
As a lecturer, he's fantastic! However, I thought the class was WAY too difficult  for a 1000-level (especially since I'm an HD major and only took this as an elective). The lectures are awesome and hilarious, but the exams were pretty hard for an intro class. You also have to do a pretty extensive term paper at the end, too.
HES THE BEST
Hands down the best class I have ever taken at Cornell!! Take it and you wont regret it!!
Dr. Levitsky is passionate and informed, also very nice. His lectures are interesting (cooking in class, etc.). Every test is TF and has an opportunity to argue points back afterwards. The work load is very low and the paper is very easy if you take NS1160. Just listen in class and you'll be fine. No textbook to buy. Lots of easy extra credit.
Professor is funny and the material is interesting. However, a lot of memorization and regurgitation is required. The wording on test questions are sometimes unclear. Take advantage of the various extra credit opportunities that are offered. Take NS 1160 if you can because it will provide sample questions and guidance for the term paper.
One of my least favorite professors at Cornell so far. Finals and prelims are purely ~120 T/F questions, many of which are awkwardly phrased. Really interesting course material, but Levitsky is incredibly unhelpful as a professor
A solid instructor, however, he is strikingly narrow-minded for a class that requires a particularly unbiased focus. He regularly comments on how to approach nutrition issues from multiple viewpoints and then neglects to do so himself. Also, the class itself is very lazily constructed and arranged. It's easy doe
Levitsky is definitely my favorite professor at Cornell so far. All of the lectures are recorded so you don't have to go to class. Prelims (2) are about 120 questions (mainly true/false and some matching). Final is cumulative. You definitely have to study hard and be able to memorize a lot of info to do well in the class but Levitsky is awesome! :)
Even though he posted all of his lectures on the Blackbaord site, I still attended. He gives interesting lectures and is very passionate about the material that he presents. The exams are very straightforward; if you know the material, then you will do very well.
Levitsky is a great professor. Very passionate about nutrition and using it to change the world. Great intro to the major, but also good as an extraneous class. Drawback: much of the research he presents is his own, so take everything he says with a grain of salt.
he puts all lectures with his voice recorded online so you don't have to go to class; really fun; great teacher!
Teacher name: Zax, David
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Was extremely approachable throughout the course and usually available and willing to discuss any challenges/questions about lab. Vagueness in person and in handouts were sometimes confusing, but more often than not, also challenged me to learn more. His lectures went well beyond what was required for labs (apt for a class full of chemists).
Purposely makes exams impossible to finish, lecture is useless, not helpful whatsoever
Lectures were completely useless
Terrible professor
Everything I learned was from the textbook. I should have skipped 90 percent of the lectures.
I thought I used to like chemistry. His lectures are incredibly unclear unless you already solidly know the material. His tests are tough, no doubt about that. Lectures seemed to be unrelated to homework or labs--studying the homework and textbooks are the key to passing. Was fairly condescending in class.  Would not recommend.
Zax is unfortunately one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He has literally described concepts as magic and makes the simplest things confusing. His demos usually have nothing to do with the lecture of the day and he often messes them up.  I generally enjoy chemistry but this was a very poor class.
Lectures were absolutely terrible and because of that it's extremely hard to do the homeworks and tests. Impossible to pass the class without reading the book yourself and viewing Khan Academy videos. Would NOT recommend.
Prof Zax's lectures are extremely unclear and often painful to attend. His power points look similar to something a 6th grader would create, he's not concise, and he often comes across as very condescending towards his students.  Just read the textbook and do the problem sets. Labs are easy, prelims are not - "designed so no one would finish"...
His lectures don't relate to any of his homework sets and are very sporadically taught in general. His lectures are often hard to follow, even if you know what you are doing. He has also describe the reason behind some chemistry to just be "magic." Questions during lecture have been answered with quick responses that don't clarify what was asked.
He is a great professor, and makes sure that students who need help can receive it. He is informative, and he tries to make this class fun.
All of the hype about Zax is completely exaggerated. He's nowhere near as cruel or intimidating as previous ratings state. That being said, his lectures are way too complicated, and his exams are tough (but not unfair). If you're an incoming freshman worried about this class, don't fear. The material is manageable if you read the textbook.
David Zax just has a chip on his shoulders. It seems that he is not only rude to students that approach him for help, but he is also horrible to the Department's grad students and other faculty members. Unfortunately, CHEM 2070 is a "weed out" class and a common requirement for many majors; so, it's either this or summer schoolchoose summer school
Totally unapproachable and tough, but the stigma around Zax and 2070 is a bit overblown. I got an A in the class without taking AP Chem and while I worked for it, it's not necessary to go to office hours every week. Prelims are tough, but it's chemistry, so the means are gonna be low and the curve will help you.
Very confusing lectures. Does not wait for the class to understand him. Tests are extremely difficult.
Ugh... Zax. He's just a really difficult test-giver. Doesn't seem friendly although I've never actually tired going to his office hours specifically. Enjoyed his lectures for the most part. It's not his fault chem 2070 is designed to weed people out. Be prepared to work hard.
He is a worse professor than Abruna. He presents the basic concepts in class, but expect students to know things to the very detail for homework and exams. His homework was unnecessarily difficult and not good for prelim preparation. He is rude and proud. The only way to do well is to study everything yourself and do a lot of problems.
Terrible professor. He is even rude to other professors and TAs. It's so unfortunate that almost every science major has to take this course
Makes topics harder to understand than they should be. Prelim and homework questions are hard and not directly from the book and hard to study for. Material covered was not that hard but he did not teach it very clearly.
I took this course in Fall 2013 with not prior AP chem (only regents chem in sophomore year). I got an A in the class but mostly because I went to the support class every week. The concepts were simple enough but Zax doesnt always explain everything in the allotted time. His lectures are better than Abruna's and I personally liked his exams better.
Teacher name: Burkhauser, Richard
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I feel that Professor Burkhauser gets unfairly criticized by people who feel that any introductory social sciences class should be a walk in the park. Yes, his final is very difficult, but doing well on it is extremely rewarding and cements your knowledge of the material covered over the 15 or so weeks prior. If you take his class, be prepared to think about all of the concepts he goes over and be wary of some trick questions, but also be prepared to learn more about economics than most other professors at Cornell could ever provide.
He is so boring that I slept in every class. But hey, his class is so easy u have to try to not get an A so what more can you ask for?
Final had new material he never discussed, and was not in the textbook. Good teacher, terrible grader.
Burkhauser is an amazing professor and really knows his economics! I loved his class so much! There were two prelims and a final. The prelims were pretty easy, and he gave a practice for each one that had basically the same information/questions as was on the actual prelim. The final was harder, but not impossible. I had an amazing semester!
He tends to go off on tangents during lectures and frequently loses his point. He also calls just about every concept "possibly the most important concept" that he will teach, which leads to confusion about what to expect on tests. He gives practice prelims which are very close to the current prelim though, so that helps.
Very good professor. Don't let the posts here scare you into not taking his class. He's a fair grader and genuinely looks out for his students.
Dr. Burkhauser speaks down to his students on a daily basis, telling them that they will fail their upcoming prelim even if 70%+ of the class got his clicker question wrong. He is unapproachable and unfriendly and his lectures are extremely unclear and do not prepare you for his incredibly difficult prelims. People walk out of his tests miserable
Lectures are very dry and boring. Also, his class was at 9:05am so that didn't help. He uses iClickers for attendance. His two prelims are reasonable as he gives a practice one before hand. His final is a lot harder and there is no practice one given. There are some really good and really bad TAs but attendance at the sections aren't required.
Honestly kind of funny and review sessions are so helpful. If you keep up with the reading and put in effort, you can get an A in this class
Unlimited attempts on problem sets (google  the answers),  prelims are very similar to past prelims and iClicker questions. The final was difficult. Literally 50% of the questions are in a totally different format than we were trained to answer.  His lectures are boring, says "uh" a lot, yells at his TAs during lecture,  mentions UChicago a lot
People are way too tough on Burkhauser. He's a really nice guy that cares a lot about the subject. Problem sets are super easy, and you can take them unlimited times online with no penalty. He personally hosts review sessions, and posts every lecture online. Burkhauser definitely sets up the students for success. Overall, very good professor.
His lectures consists of asking I-clicker questions then reviewing the results (and repeat). He doesn't teach anything useful and his class makes me dislike economics. I should have taken AP Econ in high school...
Terrible. Just Terrible.
I always knew he was gonna be an unhelpful and unclear teacher. But the first two exams were absurdly easy so I was fine with sacrificing quality for an easy grade. But the final tested us on things he never said or were in the textbook-some didn't even relate to economics. Avoid this teacher he'll really hurt your GPA and/or passion for econ
Professor Burkhauser is an interesting instructor. He does provide a politically conservative perspective when giving his lectures, but he also teaches the general theory fairly well. There are some days in which his explanations of key concepts are clear, and some days in which they are not. Overall, I thought that the class was a decent intro.
I rather dislike Prof Burkhauser. He wastes time doing practice problems instead of teaching new material. Some lectures waste time on court cases that aren't interesting and do not really get me to understand microeconomic theory. His teaching style is a little more preferable for people who are squeamish of math, but I wasn't a particular fan.
I'm not sure why so many people are giving bad reviews. I found his lectures interesting. Especially since he shows a relevant video clip during nearly every lecture. Makes some pretty funny comments, and some pretty slanted ones too
For students who need a professor who is helpful and caring, this is not the man for you. He is very passionate about Economics, but does a very poor at explaining any of the topics. I failed my first Prelim with him and then ended up getting a B+ in the class. I would not recommend him and I truly believe Burkhauser is not fit to teach this class.
Doesn't teach you anything. I received almost perfect scores on both prelims and got a B+ because the final was nothing from the lecture. If you knew econ, you were set but for some science majors that had econ for the first time, just kills your interest and gpa
His lectures are terrible, discussion sections are the most helpful but you'll end up learning a lot on your own.  10 problem sets that he lets you redo at the end, and both prelims are pretty much recycled from old exams

that himeself ,rubbish classcm1029.
Great professor. Very clear in teaching and econ experiments and  practices in his class are generally fun and helpful for learning the material. He is very responsive to students as well, analyzing every student's test result dealing with problems individually. Exams are OKAY but you got to study. I recommend taking his intro class.
not bad but you gotta study like crazy
Professor Abowd is one of the greatest professors I've had.  He was very willing to help during office hours and tried to make class interesting by making it interactive.  The problem sets were definitely hard, but if you attended office hours or tutoring you could definitely get a good grade.  Abowd was such a great teacher that when final exams c
His lectures are very intense and can range from 30-45 slides in one 50 Minute lecture.  He is a very good professor when it comes to making you learn the material, but he is more difficult than other professors teaching this course.
If you think Econ is easy, don't take this class.
Awful class, never uses the textbook but makes everyone buy it. I didn't learn anything in lecture, he makes everything unnecessarily hard, and there are waaaay too many problem sets. The tests are way to hard, and have trick questions in them.
Nice guy. Bad teacher. Class sucks. Too many aplia problem sets. And he uploads them sometimes a day before they're due. Too many of my nights have been ruined by finding out at the last minute that there is a new aplia set due. Also, the prelims do NOT reflect what is taught in class or in the problem sets. For Excel sets, FORM A GROUP. Seriously.
extremely clear; all the powerpoints are online so you dont even need to go to class.  aplia is a joke. the problem sets are easy unless you are retarded and dont know the basics of using excel (like most people in the class).  tons of practice problems online that are exactly the same as the problems on the tests.
I loved this class. Abowd is the best professor I have had so far at Cornell!
he is a terrible teacher. he does not use the book at all and tries to make jokes in lecture [only he thinks they are funny]. this is one of the worst classes i have ever taken. if you can stay away from this class and any other class he teaches
His explaination and powerpoint are crystal clear and TA's teaching is great. His assignments are bit much but the grading is fair and course materials are interesting.
Great professor! i had absolutely no prior econ knowledge and i got an A+ in the class because Abowd explains the material extremely well. It's not an easy class but definitely manageable if you put in the time. those who say you need previous calc/econ knowledge and claim that abowd is a bad professor are just idiots who didn't make an effort.
Abowd is a very egotistical prof… usually annoying to listen to in lecture. Teaches the class as if it's an advanced econ course; 'expected' to have prior econ knowledge/ have already taken calc in order to keep up.. Aplia and Excel problem sets are very annoying &amp; excessive; For the prelims, * study the old practice tests * and you will be fine.
I really did not like this course. Unfortunately, I had to take this course as part of my school's graduation requirements. The excel problem sets are incredibly time-consuming and basically useless. Don't think you'll learn a lot by going to class. You're pretty much better off staying in the dorm and reading the textbook.
Abowd is an amazing professor. I found the aplia psets extremely helpful in getting students to keep up with the reading and his prelims/final are extremely fair. excel psets take a while to do so start them early. this is definetely a good class to take because abowd really makes sure that you learn the material inside out. i wouldnt change a thin
You will definitely learn micro, Abowd is a great professor.  He's so lame but it's adorable and he throws goodies into the crowd if you just try to answer in class.  The prelims and final are multiple choice, which sucks or rocks depending on you.  Seriously BEWARE OF EXCEL PSETS.
Very nice prof. Gives prizes when you answer questions. Also very understanding. When you need an extension for a valid reason, he is likely to help you with that.
My view is slanted since I suck at Econ, but I do think he assigns a little too much work for only three credits. That having been said, the work helps you develop many different ways of looking at the problems. Prof. Abowd is not a bad guy. Just do the Excel problem sets well in advance and ALL of the old prelims to prepare for the exams.
this class is useless.  abowd needs to learn that his aplia assignments and experiments are utterly pointless and dont help at all.  his lectures are incredibly boring, and in an attempt to redeem himself he gives out bagels and frisbees in class.  I'm not usually one to be critical of a professor or class, but this is particularly bad.
Teacher name: Velleman, Paul
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher
Dr. Velleman - and though I took his class nearly 22 years ago - provides a good structural framework for how to approach statistical analysis in general. It helps develop a sense of how it should be done. Listen to this brilliant man. It will do you good. The class I took 22 years ago had a different code, so this is my best guess what it is now.
sounds like someone who did not pass the course last Spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him. He did not even teach the Fall, 2016!
The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.
We use DataDesk, a program he invented 30 years ago instead of something more modern. His ego is so big we can't use a real stat program since it was made by someone else. Makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program
He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats
Promises to be "your statistician for life" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can
I've never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he hasn't even taught yet
I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket
Very clear lecturer, excited about statistics. Does have an ego but you don't interact with him much anyway. If you study and practice with the questions at the end of the chapters, you'll do well on the exams. Put in the work and you'll learn Stats. I understand the subject so much better now. Take this class, you won't regret it.
Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers, quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.
The class is super easy. Go to lecture and do the homework and you'll be set. He bumps everyone up a huge amount at the end of the year.
I took intro stats and although Velleman is known for "taking the math out of stats" the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences. And he's super approachable. If you study, you'll do well. When he says he's taking the math out, he just means you don't have to do rote calculations; you THINK and logic it
Takes all the math out of statistics, which has its positives and negatives. Weekly homework and various different assignments required. Tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking. Class can be painfully boring at times. Best part of the class is the textbook which Professor Velleman wrote himself. Easy textbook to read.
Great textbook written by him
Velleman is an excellent teacher. I actually enjoyed reading the textbook (which he wrote), due to its conversational style and interesting examples. He posts all his lectures online, so attendance is not mandatory. If you choose not to go, you should still watch the lecture videos - they help with the homework.
I loved this class. Velleman is excellent professor, perhaps the best I've had so far at Cornell. I had no experience with Statistics before his class, but his lectures and textbook were so clear. You can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and he's great at explaining them. I strongly recommend him.
Great guy, conveyed a lot of passion about the subject, and gave a great intro to statistics. He really understands what he is teaching and to whom, and the class is well structured, even though there was some confusion about the textbooks/DVDs. He was also very democratic as to grading exams, removing confusing questions post-exam.
Good professor.
Easily one of the best (ILR) professors out there. The way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations, and instead, requires you to critically think and understand data. He's exceptionally smart, but very approachable. Tests are fair, but can be tricky; grades are curved at the end.
Teacher name: Bailey, Graeme
School name: Cornell University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Baileys teaching has subpar performance in class as a lecturer, and he is unhelpful during office hours. He is unable to convey the material clearly, and unfortunately he does not teach well.
Terrible experience.
I took this over summer. Lectures were usuall rambling, especially having to do with calculus and other unrelated math concepts, and the few homeworks that we had were nearly impossible with what he taught in class. One assignment was so hard that he extended it 2 times, but only on the last day after we'd all agonized over it and gotten no TA help
This guy is really the worst. Literally zero resources available in either class I took with him, he won't even give a syllabus or set up a course website. Loves to hear himself talk and always winds up overcomplicating things in the lecture/assumes people understand things that haven't been taught. "Open ended" HW just means there's no guidelines.
He teaches the class at a really fast pace.
Intro python over the summer was hard with him. I wouldn't say impossible, but expect to earn your grade. homework was hard(our last one was a graphical transportation simulation ). The final was doable, but you really got to understand how to explain the material (open-ended). He explains well enough, though, even when it's tough for intro cs .
TAs were always there to help at night. Professor Bailey was a bit to complicated for the Introductory course I took. He gave one long and (usually) difficult homework assignment every week or week and a half. He's pretty funny and a good guy to talk to, but be prepared to work hard if you want a good grade in his class.
Computing in the Arts was a very interesting class. More than other classes, it is what you make of it. Bailey gives you a lot of room to succeed or fail in projects and papers. His lectures are interesting and engaging, even if it is unclear how his current lecture fits into the overall class, which often happens.
Graeme Bailey is an incredible lecturer. Really passionate about the material and very accommodating to any issue you might have.  Class if really really difficult for the material covered and requires a lot of time for hw...office hours necessary. If you want an awesome teacher and difficult class, recommend
Great professor. Engaging in lectures and very dedicated to making sure every student is learning the material. Homework can occasionally be time consuming, but are also very rewarding and worth the hard work.
I have never met a worse professor in my life. This course taught by him is literally harder than all the courses I have taken at Cornell combined. Not only is he extremely unclear during lecture,his homework is also nothing but a torture to do, if not just to look at. I learnt nothing from him
Extremely interesting professor.  I actually enjoyed going to lectures.  Assignments are hard and time consuming; however, i liked his style of "do it yourself" projects where you start from scratch rather than filling in pre-organized methods/classes.
Prof. Bailey is extremely knowledgeable, not only in his command of the material, but also in how he understands and relates to students. He's very kind and caring. He's a very interesting person who makes everything come to life with his enthusiasm for the material, which is really obvious when he explains things. I highly recommend him as a prof.
Here is how the class is structured: 1) you will immediately be thrown into an extremely fast paced introduction of Java and be expected to pump out applications from scratch 2) you will learn important data structures that Bailey makes you implement in your homework 3) you will be rewarded if you work hard. Goodluck the work is worth it in the end
He teaches fast and his homework is tough but you will learn how to program and you will be glad to have had him. He taught me more about math then any math teacher I ever had before him. He's always available after class and he even helped me with an essay unrelated to the class.
great professor and great class.
GREAT PROFESSOR, THE CLASS IS NOT SUPER ORGANIZED BUT YOU WILL LEARN A LOT FROM HIM!!!!
One of the most fantastic professors I've had. Hilarious, in a Douglas Adams kind of way. Lectures move FAST, assignments are very open-ended. Often felt overwhelmed until I started speaking with him after class and during office hours. One on one, he's incredibly helpful and caring! Be sure to seek him out outside of class!
Love this prof! Class is hard, but Bailey makes it worth going - so glad I had the chance to learn from him! :)
Bailey is the man.
Teacher name: Dwyer, William
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
This was the worst class I ever took. He even warned everybody to drop the class because nobody was really going to pass. I stayed in it and I am still regretting that decision because I failed. No lectures, thinks he knows it all, and will have no compassion. Please avoid to take him this is not the teacher you want!
Quiz every class, don't miss. Read the entire chapter every single night otherwise, you will fail. He would NEVER tell us what was on the quizzes! Be a quick note taker, and don't take photos or video of the lectures, he doesn't care how much it helps you study. He's rude and contradicting. Fair warning, DO NOT TAKE HIM!
Dr. Dwyer is not only good looking in that wise college professor type of way, but he's a great teacher.  He's tough, but fair.  Don't skip class, and don't stereotype the guy.  You'll learn a lot from him if you give him a chance.  Every teacher has class rules, his are just more strict.  Do as he says and your life will be easier, trust me.
Classes were ok but, his was the only answer.  He was a know- it- all., seemed senile.  Told us to sit in front or lose lots of points. This is no joke with him. Grading was malicious and the book must be read and reread to pass,. His lectures are required but, don't mean much.  He is past retirement age. Do not expect extra help from him .
I absolutely loved this class!!! He made the material so easy to understand. Would definitely take this class again.
You will have three tests in this course that make up your final grade. Although he does give you the chance to complete extra credit, if you do not do well on one of your tests it won't help you. If you need this class as a pre req, find another professor. You will learn more and overall have a better experience in the course.
Dr. Dwyer is one of the toughest professors I have ever taken at the U of M. He very much so believes he knows what is best for everyone and will speak his mind whenever he wants to. I won't take him for anymore PSYC classes because of his know-it-all attitude and lack of compassion for students.
I just finished taking his class, he is an awesome teacher, although he is very blunt. He is the true definition of Real!! if you don't come, you wont fail you'll just have to read the book. The people on here that say he's hard are the ones who sit in the back, don't care and are re-takers. Take him, sit in the front, you'll love it!
Dr. Dwyer is definitely a tough teacher. If you put in the effort, it's not impossible to get an A. Sit in the front because you wont get distracted by surroundings. Do the SONA extra credit because that can make the difference between an A and B. He will sometimes give random extra credit for showing up after a test. His lectures are interesting.
I loved Dr. Dwyer's class. He challenged us all to think critically and to think about the theory involved in Statistics. If you want to actually learn Statistics take Dr. Dwyer! If not.......
Dwyer's cool. Don't take him if you're easily offended &amp; won't go to class. He tells you to sit in the front or you won't pass. I sat in the back &amp; have an A. Just take good notes, listen to his lectures, read the book, and you'll be fine. Do the sona extra credit too.
If you want a good grade for this class you have to go to class, take notes, read the book, take advantage of the sona extra credit. He sometimes give extra credit after the test day. Always study ahead and try to sit close to him and not in the back.
Dr. Dwyer is a tough professor. Don't take this class if you're just trying to meet a gen ed requirement. Also don't take him if you get offended easily. He is actually really funny and a great professor. Very strict on food, drinks, sleeping in class, or having headphones in. If you actually follow rules and study, you'll be just fine.
The way Dr. Dwyer teaches this class makes it very hard.  Most of the concepts are easy to grasp.  However, his lectures barley corresponded with his tests.  I attended class every day but one.  I had a 4.0 before this class and got a C on every test.  I ended up getting a B.
Start off by saying, if you can avoid taking Dwyer for anything, you should. 3 tests, 50 points each. I entered college with a 4.2 GPA and have all As or A+s in every other class but this one. His tests are near impossible to pass (I view passing as a B or better) and his lectures are irrelevant to PSYC. His opinion is the only opinion that counts
Dwyer knows what he's talking about. I once called him the Donald Trump of U of M, because of his very...."honest" way about things. (aka how he said "f your opinion! i know what's up"). He doesn't hold back, even if people will get offended.  But he's not preaching propaganda. He knows what he's talking about, and his lectures are very useful.
Dwyer is excellent. He's straightforward, he knows his stuff and he gives every opportunity and encourages for his students to learn and succeed. Some people don't like the fact that he isn't shy with his opinions about certain topics but he relates it to the class material. He isn't arrogant, he just won't take any BS. He encourages questions.
i dont like him at all
Dwyer is one of my favorite professors! He said the first day that if you sat in the back you would  fail, so I moved to the front and took good notes. His lectures have alot of information that you will need on the test, but breaks it up with some humor. He doesn't take any mess, he tells you what he expects the first day. I'd take him again.
Dr. Dwyer is a man full of knowledge. He will tell you right off the bat that half of the class will fail, and they will. If you sit at the front of the class, attend EVERY class, read the book, and study, you will pass. He is an awesome man, and I would take his class again!
Teacher name: Coyne, Joshua
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
he is a mean and unhelpful teacher. avoid him!!!
Dr. Coyne may be the best, (if not, one of the best) teachers at U of M. His wealth of knowledge and ability to articulate absolutely blows me away. He's extremely well versed in all of the topics discussed in the course. He is also willing to spend extra time with students who need help on assignments. Knowledge is quite attractive... just sayin!
I learned a lot in Dr. Coyne's class. I really enjoyed his class. He really makes you work for your grade, but you'll learn a lot. I would definitely take his class again, if I could!
I loved Dr. Coyne for my tax class but I have had a horrendous experience with the Accounting Systems class. I've had a 4.0 in accounting my entire school career, and now I am struggling to maintain a B because I'm not a technology/code nerd. This is a mandatory class so I recommend taking it by itself in the summer- you'll need 6-10 hours weekly.
Taking Accounting Systems online with Dr. Coyne has been great. The content is well-organized, lectures are clear, and schedule is easy to follow. Quizzes and exams are easy if you just read the lectures. He cares about students and will help if you reach out. Easily the most professional instructor at Memphis.
Dr. Coyne is hard core; however, I deeply respect his passion for the subject and his intensity. In all honesty, I love he challenges her presents to students. He makes you LEARN the material, not just complete busy work for grades. If you take the time to learn the information, ask questions, and read, you will do very well in any course of his.
This is one of the hardest and most rude professors I have ever taken. He hardly responded to my emails and wasn't professional when I asked for some assistance with an issue concerning the class. I do not recommend taking this Accounting Systems course from him online, maybe he is better in class.
Overall Professor Coyne has been one of my best instructors at the University of Memphis. I appreciated that we didn't have to purchase a textbook, instead Prof. Coyne prepared thorough slides for us to learn from. I imagine this takes more effort, and for me it was a success.
Professor Coyne uses his own materials for class. It's a tough class, but you will do well if you read the lectures and complete all of the assignments. He is always available for questions. He wants his students to succeed.
I took ACCT 4020 online with Mr. Coyne. I would 100% retake the same class with him again if I would have failed. I ended with B- in the class and that was with me busting my ASS the last two weeks. It was hard to keep up the weekly quizzes and homework. Always would respond to emails as soon as possible
Awesome teacher. One of the classes you will enjoy going too. Attendance is not required but you will receive a participation grade at the end of the semester. One presentation on your topic of choice
Professor Coyne is a lot of fun to take. He is a very open teacher and is willing to listen to your thoughts and ideas. The quizzes are timed and detailed but can be passed if you just read the lectures. You have homework once a week and it ranges on scale of difficulty but the difficult homework is gone over in class. Over all a fun teacher.
Quiz every week, LOTS of reading but the tests are easy. Make sure to save all lectures so you can use them on the exam.
I liked Professor Coyne. Although the assignments are difficult his instructions are really thorough. I would take him again and I recommend him as a professor.
The Practice set is graded harshly in my opinion, but he factors that into his grading logic. There are no make-ups or late submissions, which makes diligence absolutely necessary, but the material is good stuff.
Professor Coyne is overall pretty fair. On a lot of homework he gives example so thats helpful. You have to pay attention to his tutorials but pretty much listen. He does respond back fast if you email him.
I took  Professor Coyne  online.  He was a good teacher, you had puzzles, lecture notes, and homework.  The only test was the final and he give you extra credit at the end.
Professor Coyne's tutorials, lectures, and reading assignments  were very organized and very helpful with completing ACCT 4020.
This class had a variety of materials and learning opportunities. I enjoyed learning the different programs and the challenges within the assignments.
Lectures consist of slides.  Tutorials are necessary for homework, but if you watch them while you're working and pause when he says to, they are easy to follow, but you can't skip a tutorial.  Also, be prepared to do work on the PRACTICE SET during the 1st half of the semester.  Sometimes he assigns 2 sets per milestone, so READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.
Teacher name: Laumann, Dennis
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Laumann overall is a good professor. He's funny, thought-provoking, and very entertaining so although there's a lot of listening and notes required, he makes it interesting. The stuff about the ego and strictness is true, he loves hearing himself talk. However if you just listen and do the work, he's overall pretty fun and not terribly hard.
His lectures are amazing and he relates them to current political topics. Be ready to take lots of notes because the mid-term and final are based on them. He doesn't allow technology. He is also a very funny man so you'll enjoy going to class everyday!
I loved coming to class because he really makes the lecture exciting.
Excellent and engaging in lectures, and the weekly quizzes are very simple with the textbook. As long as you attend and take notes, youre guaranteed an A.
Dr Laumann was one of the toughest professors I've ever had but super funny guy. He cares a lot about what he is teaching, which made his lectures very interesting. I took his class over summer and his test were hard. about 10 short answers for each test. Be prepared to study.
Super stringent grader and no tech allowed in class at all
Dr. Laumann was amazing. He was easy to understand and while others were offended by his words, he was truthful. This was a history class and the study of religion was necessary. I would recommend him to everyone. I am trying to take another one of his classes as soon as possible. PS listen to the man. He is not afraid to kick you out of class.
As a 41-yr-old seeking a second career, Dr. Lauman has not earned my respect as a professor or as a human. He clouts his equality but shows it by his condescending use of "my brother or my sister." He wears his academic prowess as a badge to demand respect from younger students in their first semesters of college. Make sure you attend class.
I took this class so that I could take the study abroad trip to Cuba during Spring Break, and it was pretty amazing! He wants your papers to be almost perfect so do them ahead of time and get them checked. He comes off as rude sometimes but he is okay as long as the class participates. No phones, no talking, just listen and participate!
Dr. Laumann is a solid choice for World Civ I. He grades from a map quiz (basic geography, 10%), a syllabus quiz (5%) two papers (15% each), two exams (midterm 15%, final 20%), and 10 online quizzes for which the answers can easily be found online. The book is good for preparing for exams and writing the papers, but you can get by without it.
I love Dr. Laumann since the day I entered his class. He's hilarious and very blunt. If you don't go to class you definitely won't pass. Reading the textbook also helps but it isn't really required. He's understanding if you're in a sticky situation and is really about equality but he won't babysit you. Also class participation isn't required but you should definitely participate.
If you look past the constant stream of profanity, his inability to act in such a manner as to actually deserve the respect he demands, or his ignorance of academia, critical thinking, or open-mindedness like he touts -- he might have the potential to be a decent professor.
Dr. Laumann is totally awesome. Just be proficient and make it a priority to attend class and you will be fine. Lectures are great and very informative, also he's very funny and you will most definitely have fun in this class.
Professor Laumann is extremely passoniate about African history.  You will do a lot of reading, 10 quizzes, and exams.  Oh yeah, random assignments that are not on the syllabas.  Whatever you do don't miss his class, and pay attention!! Please don't be snarky with him he will shut you down.  Overall, I enjoyed the class, would take him again!
Dr. Laumann is my favorite professor at the UofM. He's interesting, funny, makes people think, and is very open. His class was easy if you showed up and took the notes. 2 papers, 2 exams, and 10 online quizzes. Super easy. He makes you work for the grade but as long as you try you can't fail his course. I wish I could take him again.
Definitely one of the best professors I've had being here for 3 years. He will make you work for the grade, but if you just do the work, there won't be a problem. 2 papers, 2 exams, and chapter quizzes from the book-that you don't need to pass them.
This has got to be my favorite class I've ever taken. He is completely straightforward with what he wants and made me fall in love with history. There are 10 online quizzes, 2 exams, and 2 short papers. If you show up for the lectures and take great notes you'll pass no problem. He is very open minded about religions and politics, but I enjoyed it.
I took Dr. Laumann for World Civ. 1, and I actually did enjoy the class. He demands manners, and he doesn't tolerate nonsense. If you're a Christian, ehhh, well, he probably doesn't like you. But, as big of a Christian as I am, I have to say that i enjoyed his class. To those who are offended easily, walk out the door and find another teacher!
Best teacher ever. Come to class and you will easily pass.
He was amazing, I sat at the front &amp; I highly recommend you do. If he sees that you care he will be kind &amp; helpful. As for reading the book...I never did and I passed everything. My grade in that class was an A! :) He's a great teacher and his lectures are fun and you will always learn something new! Enjoy (: (World Civ)
Teacher name: Biggers, Charles
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Biggers is a great teacher, he is so full of knowledge he sometimes gets lost in his words though. He is retiring after this semester, and myself along with many others students will miss him dearly. Such a precious teacher. Best of wishes to him!
His lectures sometimes go in circles, but if you just stick with him then he usually wraps up his example. You will not use the textbook!! You will use the Great Minds book. He also tells you that his lecture notes are optional, BUY THEM!! There is no way that I could have made it through the class without them. He only uses the notes to teach.
Definitely not an easy class. You have to be willing to put in some serious time &amp; effort studying. He does drop your lowest grade &amp; then adds bonus points to the other tests, which helps, but don't depend on it. Just study, study, study! The class is not impossible; just takes determination. The worst thing you can do is let negativity get to you.
This professor needs to retire. You can be a great student and study but you have to be able to study for his class 24/7 literally. He took until the week before fall break then gave three test within four weeks who truly can study that much with such a short amount of time. When you sign up for his class think of it like a summer course
He is a terrible teacher, but unfortunately the only physical teacher UofM offers. He is confusing, but bases his tests off the notes he gives. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THE BOOK. He gives prints of his notes at an office store in Germantown and also puts PDFs of them on eCourseware. Also makes you buy his own book. Unfortunately, this is needed.
DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN!!! GO TO SOUTHWEST IF YOU HAVE TO!!! he is scatterbrained and no matter what you do for his tests, you prob won't do well. try to avoid if possible! he rambles about nothing until like two weeks before exams and then BAM everything! he tries with podcasting and his notes but still...try another prof.
Everyone has always said how hard and awful his class was. Personally, I did not find that it was either for me. I loved to go to his classes because while he does tell stupid stories, he also give valuable, accurate and USEFUL info. Like anything else, go to class, study, ask questions. You learn a lot from people who love what they do.
ONE WORD: STRESSFUL! This class was by far the most difficult all year from 2010 the first semester to 2020 the second. There is entirely TOO MUCH to study for one exam alone. I never felt confident before or even after taking an exam in that class. Biggers lectures and test questions hardly ever correlate. &gt;&gt; STRESSFUL! &lt;&lt; Good Luck!
Where to start? I'll say this: he is a nice man. Kinda like a cool grandpa. But he is way too old to teach. I thought everyone was joking when they said he takes 3 months for the first test then jams the last three up. Not joking. Asks stupid questions about his daughters and animals and words his questions for the sole purpose of tripping you up.
His class is not as hard as everyone says; time consuming but not too difficult. Studying is a must. Read the clinical connections in the book, get his notes and listen to the podcasts because he can be unclear and jump around with his lectures. Study sessions are available, but I never went and passed with an A. He also curves the grades
If you are a Nursing major, you should take him. His class is very difficult &amp; stressful but I think it will help a lot once you get into the nursing program. I got a B+ and studied just about every night. There's no 'right' way to study for this class because he just puts whatever he wants on the exam. If you don't HAVE to take this class, don't.
This class is not as hard as people tend to make it seem. It is not one of those classes that you can easily pass by studying at the last minute. If you study, attend study sessions, and put in effort, then you can pass with at least a C. He does, however, make tricky exams. He adds a few points, so it is a trade. With determination, I made an A.
DON'T EVEN BOTHER. This class is very very stressful. The exams are STUPID hard (studying or not) You have 4 exams. One exam is dropped. The final counts as TWO test grades. Don't do it to yourself PLEEEASE.
This is a class you have to study for. Go to class because he uses attendance to curve grades. Tutoring helps more than the professor’s lectures. Also know the Clinical Connections and the scientists he gives. They are on the exams! And don't fret too much because he loves to add points to exams but don't rely on it!
Don't take him. Take Simco instead. He has super confusing notes and was one of the worst teachers I have had.
This is not a class that you can pass without much studing. Attendance is not mandatory but there is a roll to sign though I recommend you go for the lecture because he gives hints for exams and he'll use attendance to curve grades. Utilize the tutoring! He'll also drop the lowest grade
Dr. Biggers is very knowledgeable about A&amp;P!I did not take him for A&amp;P1 but I enjoyed A&amp;P2.This  is not hard to pass at all if you put in the effort to study.DO NOT just study the lecture notes however.I relied heavy on my book and that is how I earned my high grades on exams.All the info is very valuable,especially for health majors.I enjoyed it.
Dr. Biggers is an awesome professor. He knows his stuff! Make sure to STUDY! This is not the class to goof off in and try to coast through but then again that's what college is supposed to be right? Listen to the podcasts and LEARN YOUR CLINICAL CONNECTIONS!!!!! Definitely a must take professor if you're a nursing student like me.
Dr. Biggers is a nice guy. He will give you as much help you need. The class is not easy. You HAVE to study and listen to the podcasts. Try studying and listenig to a few podcasts a day. You should do well.
STUDY!. Listen to the podcast. read the book. DO NOT wait till the last minute to try and study for the test, because you would not do well. biggers gives you everything you need to pass the class. If you fail, it's because you did not try as hard as you could have. Really. I got a "C", and it was because I was lazy. You can't be in this class!!!
Teacher name: Brown, Martha
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
You get four tests, and a homework grade worth 20%, the tests are very specific and if you do not study every night, you probably will not get an A. Did not expect this from anatomy and physiology one...
Would definitely not suggest this teacher. If you can take A&amp;P online definitely do. It is such a broad subject and her questions were super specific and there were very few assignments so if you have one bad grade its over.
I would not recommend taking this class with Mrs. Brown. She is very difficult. All she does is read straight off the power point and the power point does not contain the information you need. You basically have to teach your stuff. The wording of her test is very difficult and she likes to confuse you. The test are over 5 or more chapters.
Get ready to read, on your OWN. The class may be lecture heavy, but completely useless in teaching anything. Book is online and exams are quite difficult considering you must teach yourself. Does give bonus quizzes. Make sure to take notes and review them every single day and look back over every assignment.
It's obvious students who think the PPTs and tests differ don't delve into the material from the powerpoint. PPTs are not supposed to be end all be all. You must pay special attention to what the text says about what's highlighted in the PPTs. Don't be mad at her b/c you are lazy. You shouldn't be a nurse. College &amp; AP2 are supposed to be hard.
Martha Brown is such a sweet lady but when it comes to teaching, not the best. All she does is read straight from the power points and says the tests are based off of them but they definitely are not. This is the hardest class I've taken and I invested many hours into studying for this class, but still never passed a test. Don't take this class.
I took her for anatomy and physiology this semester and let me say that her class was TOUGH. She reads lots of PowerPoints, gives lots of homework, and gives extremely hard exams. If you have to take this class, beware that it requires a lot of dedication.
The class is extremely boring and hard the only why I suggested that you can passed the test is to study the Wiley plus homework. For the most part the test back question are going to be on the exam and just review the chapter power point. Over all if you can Get at least a 60 on your exam you will pass the class with a C.
This class is the meaning of anxiety. Martha Brown is passable, but it is very hard. She has 4 exams (3 and 1 final), homework grade (which she curves at the end), and also bonus quizzes. Her exams are VERY difficult because she teaches from a powerpoint and says the questions come from there, but they don't. If you major is nursing take it online.
I am a future PA student who would consider myself a smart student. But this teacher is just unreasonable. Her powerpoints do not have much information on them yet she tells you to study them. She shows videos instead of teaching you the material. Her tests are not straightforward though she acts like they will be!
Go to class. Study the PPTs. Not enough info on the PPTs to just study them w/o your class notes. Know the physiology, figures, and summary tables. Info will get left out from the book; don't worry about it. It's not hard to make a B but you need to dedicate a day per chapter of studying. Shocked so many people failed. How did you pass AP I?
Insanely boring! She will read nothing but power point slides for an hour and half while never actually teaching you anything. Don't ask her for help because she will not give it to you!! Her test will cover strictly the power point slides and things discussed in class, I highly suggest you attend class! I wouldn't take her class again, NOT EVER!!!
I took this professor for A&amp;P I and II and although both classes were challenging, they were passable. You must work hard though and be prepared to study. She also gives homework ,pop quizzes, and curves your final grade which help tremendously. Overall, I didn't find either of the classes too difficult to pass. I rcvd an A (A&amp;P I) and a B in II.
If you don't have to take this class PLEASE DON'T! I'm an honor student so I have to keep my gpa up, but this class was like 5 classes combined. It was extremely difficult. Thankfully, I passed with a B.
This professor is HORRIBLE! Avoid her by ANY MEANS NECESSARY! The book selected for the class is very detailed. She will say study the slides and not the book. However in order to pass you will have to review the slides, homework questions and read the text. She is not understanding and will brush off any of your concerns. You've been warned!
Unbelievably Boring Class! I really could not deal. I tried, honestly. She's older and I feel that she was probably great in her younger years. The tests, for me, were too much. 5 CHAPTERS packed in one test, and I hate Biology, so it was really too much for me. UGH!
I would not take this class. You can take it online or try to get Koontz or another anatomy teacher. Homework grades help, and she does curve. But her tested insanly hard. It will be over 7 chapters and still she will ask specific questions. I'm an all A/B student in all of my other classes &amp; I will barely pull a C in this class. Don't take!
Her tests are very difficult and require A LOT of studying to pass- the lectures don't really give you an idea of what will be on the actual exams. I didn't do well on my exams, but the homework and tutoring helped. She is kind with a soft voice so you need something to keep you alert during her lectures. She also doesn't mind answering questions.
Worst professor I've had. I make awesome grades in college and I made a awful grade in this one. HER ARE AWFUL. DO NOT TAKE HER. I wish I would've read her reviews, if you plan on taking her DON'T!!!! If you're a nursing major and need AP1 and AP2 find another professor!
Be ready to read. Lectures make it seem as if test will be straight forward which is not the case, but the class is passable. I passed with a B but most of the class had low Cs or dropped. Don't treat it like a cake walk and you'll be fine.
Teacher name: Enck, Graves
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Prof Enck is 80 years old. He is very stuck in his ways and teaches based on that. Tests are tricky and confusing, but he does offer a part two that allows you to earn half the points you missed back. I only missed a couple classes and took notes but still made Ds or Fs on the test. DO NOT TAKE PROF ENCK.
Professor Enck is the best! He lectures the entire class which can be boring but if you listen and take notes it is so easy. Everything he puts on the board will be on the test so just study that. He also gives a part 2 of the exam which allows you to get points added back! He is very nice and understanding. Wish i could take more classes by him!
You don't have to take notes since he puts everything on eCourseware, and if you study all of it, the exams are not hard. He lectures every class, which can be boring at times. There are 3 lab assignments, 3 exams (one is the final), and an online quiz over every chapter. Each exam has 2 parts; part 2 gives you a chance to have points added back.
Professor Enck is a cool guy and has lots of good stories to tell, but his overall class is not good at all. He spends the entire class lecturing and going on and on about stuff that he expects us to know already. Tests are hard and had nothing to do with the actual class work and lectures. Overall a really hard class that shouldn't be hard.
Doctor Enck is a great guy, but if your looking for an easy A this is not the class to take. He expects everyone to be a sociologist and its literally an intro to sociology 1010 class. We literally had to do math formulas on the last lab and calculate values of coefficients. He lectured alot and his test were hard. I had a 3.7 GPA before this class
Very long lectures that pertain to his life more than sociology. Tests are so hard, they make no sense.
Professor Enck really cares about his students and only wants to see everyone pass. All the quizzes are online &amp; he puts all the assignments you'll need to know on eCourseware. This is just like any college class so you will have to put effort in to get the grade you want. The text book was free &amp; online. He lets the class out early half the time.
Dr. Enck's class wasn't easy but it also wasn't hard. He wants you to actually understand what he is teaching. His lectures can get boring, but the questions on his tests are phrased exactly how he talks during lecture. The tests are based mostly on these diagrams he gives out. He's extremely kind and always willing to help if you need it.
very good professor. he's really funny and makes jokes every class. The quizzes were all easy and online. The test were a different story, half would be easy and the other half was foreign unless you reaf the textbook word for word.  He was also very easy to get in contact with if you were to have any problems.
He is tough, but if you go to him during office hours and ask for help, HE WILL give it to you.
His class is very hard. Tests were even harder, if you take him good luck.
Made a b - as a freshman, he is sweet and tries his best to be there for his students.
Dr. Graves Enck is a really sweet man and is more than happy to answer any questions you have for him. Going to the classes only benefit you if you go to the class right before a lab assignment. He only gives three tests and they are HARD unless you studied schematics thoroughly.
I enjoyed listening to the lectures, BUT the tests were not over anything we covered in class or in the book. It seemed like he pulled the phrasing for questions out of nowhere, but he did give us a makeup exam after each test for half credit back. He does take attendance and the book can be found online with the access code. My class average: 60
Hands down the smartest professor I have ever had. His class completely changed my world. Do not take this class for an easy A, you will not find it here. If you treat college like it is high school, this class is not for you. That being said, Enck is an amazing person who wants you to succeed but expects you to "take charge of your own learning".
Despite all complaints, I loved his class-as in I actually loved going to classes. He's a very smart man, and the lectures were always interesting. The main problem was that the lectures were rarely on the texts, but the exams were, and that could get confusing. The tests were also difficult, but that's probably due to they were hard to study for.
I never would have passed Graduate Statistics without the guidance and help of this entertaining and brilliant professor. I highly recommend taking his classes. And, get to know him. He is very friendly and approachable. You will be glad you did.
Enck is a funny old man, great sense of humor, always in a good mood! BUT, he never talks about the reading he assigns in class. Makes his test impossible to pass. My class average for the midterm exam was a 43! Terrible!
He's a nice man and he really tries to be helpful. his lectures are confusing. we never discussed what we read in the book. I came to every class and took notes and I didnt pass a test. Take my advice and do not take this class.
Lovely, old man. He's very understnading. His personality is how all professors should be. BUT, class is hard and boring. The way he teaches is very confusing. He is smart and knows what he teaches about but still confusing to us. Many people dropped, BUT he's very very helpful. ONLY take him if your major is Sociology.
Teacher name: Bacopulos, Dionysia
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
You don't have to show up to class to pass, she is very easy made an A. You do have to buy the book though because there is an access code you'll need to do your homework and quizzes.
She explains everything in an easy to understand way instead of trying to over complicate stuff.
Very nice and a GREAT teacher in the math department. I would love to have her teach all my math courses because I cannot stand math but I am getting a good grade in her class
Very nice and caring. Made everything easy to understand.
I am not a math person and Ms B made it easy.
Professor Bacopulos is very helpful and her lectures are very simple. She's a great choice. FYI your homework, quizzes and tests are online. No extra credit
Best teacher ever.
Mrs. B was great, she has an odd humor about her. Just make sure you do your homework and quizzes each week and you'll pass with an easy A. If you have any questions she's very polite and willing to help.
explains things very well and if you do not get it she explains it again.
Most helpful.  I am bad in math and found Ms Bacopulos helps you through the problems.
Never used the book but MUST have access code
Easy her class is all online based the HW CW and Quizzes even test. All the same format. On quiz day or Test day they online assignment is password protected so you have to show up then. but the rest you can do from home. Her lectures are easy and she pretty much works the problems that are CW. she spend the his half teaching the rest of the class is HW time.
As a person who was ALWAYS terrible at math she did make it so much more easier for me. I took her in the summer and followed EVERY direction she uttered and PASSED. If your major ables you to take MATH 1420 and you do not consider yourself a math wiz I highly recommend her especially during the summer.
She was a god send. I hated math but needed this course. she made everything easy and there were no hard assignments.
Professor Bacopulos was definitely my favorite professor! She really made my transition as a Freshman easier. I would definitely take her class again!
I recommend you take her.She's the best ever!
This is by far the best Math class I have taken EVER. She is the BEST Math teacher. She makes everything crystal clear &amp; she teaches well. You dont need the book only the access code. My Math Lab will serve as the book. She is the sweetest woman ever. Always pleasant and willing to help. Loved this class!
Professor Bacopulos single handedly restored my faith in math. I have never met a professor who genuinely cares that students understand the information &amp; can pass quizzes/tests. Yes everything is online &amp; yes if you have good notes and pay attention it's simple. But sometimes Math is a tough subject no matter how much you prepare. She is awesome!!
LOVED this class, and i HATE math. Super easy, all the work is online. As long as you take good notes or copy homework it is an easy 100! You would have to be an idiot not to pass this class with flying colors
Everything is online: quizzes, homework, tests. You don't have to go to class...I only went on test days. You can get everything from doing the homework online; it will tell you how to solve every problem.
Teacher name: Doroshenko, Nataliya
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Attendance isn't mandatory, but it does affect your grade. Come to class, take notes, and everything else will be easy.
I took the online section and didn't need to take a single note. She posts her own (short)notes in elearn (not that you'll need them). Three super easy homeworks due in my math lab every two weeks. Three attempts per question plus three attempts on the assignment itself. I never even took algebra and passed with an A+. TAKE HER CLASS
I love Ms. Doroshenko, she is sweet and funny. She has a thick accent but it's not too hard to understand her. I did not like the program we used during class (TopHat). She says not to worry about your grade until the end of the semester because what is reflected in TopHat is inaccurate, so that was irritating. But the actual class itself is easy.
Absolutely amazing! Such a respectable professor! Would recommend her to anyone!! Super sweet. Her accent is thick but after the first week or so you get used to it so it isn't an issue at all! Please take her! Homework is a big chunk but she gives you the exact homework questions in class and on tests. Super easy and good. Show up to class!!
She's really fun and funny. Work load is not hard and she allows the class to be paced by us. She's also really passionate and willing to help. Just communicate with her! For sure always show up to class, it can be a tad bit easy to get behind.
She is so funny! Great teacher that you can ask any question. She will return emails, and there is no textbook. She takes attendance through top hat with a code that she tells you at the end of class. Do not think you can get someone to send you the code she counts heads and she will notice.
She is so funny and nice! This class is not hard and thats coming from someone who isnt the best at math. Show up and youll do great. She explains well with tons of examples. She takes attendance but thats only to know if youre failing because you never show up. She is very easy to talk to and makes class comfortable
Come to class to get attendance that is incorporated in the final grade. Exams are no surprise and she does review with you before. A lot of classwork, make sure to do it to get your grade up. Overall, very nice and genuinely wants you to understand. May be a bit fast-paced though so keep up.
Loved her online statistics class. She didn't make the class stressful at all and was very reasonable and understanding of outside life and the need for extra time. I would most definitely recommend her for your math course.
Loved Doroshenko!! She made statistics really easy. Exams were easy because she allows a "cheat sheet" out when taking it. Attendance was mandatory because it was a grade. Super recommend this class.
Statistics is a hard class, but she made it not too hard. Take her
Mrs. D is fantastic! I'm planning to take some of her other Math classes next semester. She is so funny and makes class fun and light. She did not take attendance and all our work in on My Math Lab. Take her class if you get the chance!
She is a very caring and thorough instructor. She will repeat and help with anything that you dont understand as long as you have good attendance. She is a fair grader.
She is super flexible. Class was very easy with not to much homework and drops your lowest test grade. Super funny lady and would take her again.
One of the more enjoyable professors at this University. Never made any lectures difficult, and we normally got out a little early. Everything we do, aside from the tests, are on tophat. She makes sure we understand everything by doing review classes before the test. Plus, she is funny and nice.
One of the best math teachers I have ever had. She is funny and a very skilled teacher. Even though class is not mandatory, try to show up anyway. Sometimes she likes to give extra credit to those who are present. Just do your homework and you should be fine.
She is very patient and will go over everything that you need to know for the tests. You mainly work as a class on Tophat, you dont need to buy a textbook from the bookstore, and homework is to watch five minute videos and sometimes read an article. She allows cheat sheats and is a total sweetheart.
This class isn't difficult at all. There is a lot of repetition in lessons, and we do everything online. Tests are open note and very few. As long as you come to class, you're fine.
Best teacher in the department of Mathematical Sciences! Easy to follow. Just show up to class and do your TopHat exercises. Goes over all the tests and makes sure everyone understands.
I took her for my statistics class &amp; I would highly recommend. She is great at teaching &amp; isn't tough at all. She does take attendance on TopHat &amp; you will have assignments to do on there in class but they're easy &amp; she almost gives you the answers to everything. Mostly in-class work. Her tests are multiple choice &amp; she reviews w/ the actual test.
Teacher name: Taller, Barbara
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
you MUST STUDY FOR HOURS EVERYDAY
Difficult but doable as long as you go to class and are willing to put in the time to read the textbook, review the lecture slides, and finish the online assignments. This class prepared me well for more advanced science classes in the future. Dr. Taller is very nice and gives helpful feedback during exam review sessions and office hours.
So there are 4 professors but Taller is over the whole thing ! She makes all the test. They teach the basics of bio but will test you on a PhD level.. but its only preparing you for whats ahead. So please study hard! When she tell you to study bio 5-6 hours a day, TRY TO AT LEAST DO at least 4 hours a day!
Please do not take this professor. She only teaches the basics of Biology, yet tests you on a professional level. She often says the textbook and Google are wrong, only she is right. This will only confuse you further. She is the worst professor at the University of Memphis.
One of those teachers you don't enjoy in the moment but do afterwards. Her breakdown of the class was fantastic.
I had Taller for Micro. It was a tough class and she wants to challenge you, but it is possible to get an A. Be prepared to study for this class. If not, you will get a C or below. Taller was willing to help outside of class if I ever had questions. She comes off as mean in class, but if you go to her office hours she's not as bad.
Taller comes across as gruff and not cuddly. I understand this since her job is basically destroyer of dreams. However, she's very clear about expectations. She teaches to what would be the national norm. BIOL 1120 is much tougher and most people get 1 letter grade lower than Taller's class. Decent lecturer, the gruffness makes her stick.
I am taking this as a summer course, and I regret it. Clicker questions that she puts up are made to trick you and her tests are the same way. The usual average is just above a 50. The homework isn't bad but she doesn't seem happy to answer questions at all and makes you feel dumb for asking them. Have fun and good luck in your first biology class.
so hard
She is absolutely terrible. She will lecture on one thing and then test you over another. It drove me crazy. I would study so hard for her tests, and I would get to the test and just be completely lost. She doesn't test you over what is in the lecture. So get ready to read because you're going to have to teach yourself.
I took her in the summer. Exams are ridiculously difficult. She expects you to know the book cover to cover. Exam class average was always an "F". You'd think she'd do something to help but she doesn't care. The curve and online work saved us. I should have gotten a "D". Don't take her if you don't have to.
Difficult
It's a tight class, that's a given. However, Dr. Taller always provided herself for help at anytime. The grades were always in the fail category. Your tests are 75% of the final grade. However, you need do your best with the other categories as well. Every surgery and opportunity for bonus, take them.  I should have gotten a D, received a B.
The course is split between four professors and Taller's sequence is definitely the hardest. While she is tough, she's also fair. She's also there to help anyone who needs it. Study and understand how to apply the material; make sure to do your best on the HW, practice exams, and participation as that could be the difference between an A and C.
Took general biology one with Dr. Taller and made an A fall 2016. Super easy, but then again I am a chem major. If you're a bio major or haven't had science classes you could experience some issues, but the caliber is not difficult for chem majors. Seriously,  it's a cake walk.
Read the book. Find online quizzes by the bookmaker. Make your own notes. Some of the test questions are just, ugh. Sometimes there is more than one possible answer, chose the best one. Be sure to do all of the learnsmarts, quizzes, and try your best in the participation sections of class.
The lectures have NOTHING TO do with tests. She will tell you not to read the book because she knows better. SHE DOESN'T. READ THE BOOK. The lectures and slides are a waste of time. She goes too fast to write them down anyway
Taller prepares students for upper division and professional school. She gives you objectives (study guides);I filled it out&amp;studied them &amp;HW&amp; did above average on every test. If the average is low, she will give a curve in order to make a better average. if you go in her office hours she is a completly diff person but helps you clarify things.
The test had nothing to do with the slides,she also goes through the slides too quickly. The tests have little to do with the homework and quite frankly it may be best to just read the book. She just stared at me while i was taking a test while standing next to me for no reason at one point. Despite it being a waste you have to attend class
Definitely take her during the summer. She's a lot more laid back and it helps during tests that all the work is relatively fresh. Take good notes from connect and you'll do fine.
Teacher name: Sorin, Anna
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I took it online and had to use ProctorU which is where someone watches you take your test. I didn't think it'd be that bad BUT it always took FOREVER to set up my test which is so annoying sitting waiting on proctor to help you. Also she assigned so much unnecessary work it was ridiculous especially for a class for non science majors to take.
She knows her Biology, for sure, however be careful. Her tests can be especially brutal, and as I took it online, it requires you use a proctoring service on your computer. She does offer extra credit. Do it, you'll need it for the test. It is a very work-heavy course, however the program used as the text book is pretty great.
Warning!!  This teacher is cell phone crazy, I mean she hates them.  Don't push her crazy button, and you will really enjoy the class, she is very kind and very helpful despite her natural serious sounding tone.
Out of the four professors teaching this course she was definitely the best. She wanted the class to understand rather than just get through the material. Her material also wasn't too hard. She very attractive haha
Take Dr. Sorin, if you have the opportunity don't pass it up.  Dr. Sorin wants everyone in her class to succeed.  She encourages students to ask questions.  She makes you think and respects your opinions and beliefs.  The way she organizes her class is very effective- two in class tests and a final.  You gain bonus points by coming to class.
Shes is super funny and sarcastic. She helps relate biology to the new generation of students. But is very serious about her class and you learning. I LOVE her so much she is one of the best professors I had at the University of Memphis. Be There  and be on time and have that phone out of site!
I LOVED her! She is sarcastic and funny, yet also very serious and passionate about teaching you correctly. She knows it is not your major but caters to what non-majors are interested in. I recommend her to anyone who is willing to work, but also interested in looking forward to class.
The class was taught by 4 professors. Dr. Sorin interacts with ALL students, demands participation, and is as much focused on you and visa versa. She brings extra material in conversation that offers more conceptualization over the topics that she is covering in class. Very interactive and fun lectures. Pat attention, and come to class prepared.
Dr. Sorin isn't that bad. I am just not into biology so I found this class a little on the tough side.  You have to really study for the tests (they are super hard) and do the homework on time. She does give quite a bit of extra credit which has pretty much saved my grade.
Mandatory attendance policy. HW is all online but she does give bonus points that go towards the test. Not an easy class, but if you do your HW and study you should be fine.
Took Professor Sorin back in 2010. She was great, good lectures considering I wasn't a major. She wanted people to pass. Gave extra credit.
Yes, she has AMAZING thought provoking lectures, but she has a demanding personality which can make me see how people feel belittled if they're not on her level of knowledge. Doesn't realize that not everyone is a bio major. Tests have a LOT of content to cover. Book is needed.  Clickers are needed. Understanding is needed rather than memorization.
She is very passionate in teaching Biology. She is not easy though. I hope I pass because her class is taking up too much time.
I enjoyed Dr. Sorin's class. She has a wealth of knowledge and does pretty well to get it to you. Her tests definitely aren't "easy" but she gives so many oppurtunities for extra credit that if you put in a little effort and show up to class you'll be fine. On average I had 15 extra points on tests. She takes up cell phones. Dont sit at the front.
Dr. Sorin is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. I did not even like biology, before taking her class; now, I want to change my major! Participation is from answering in-class response questions. I never used the book- EVER! And I have been making high A's on everything. She offers a lot of extra credit. Exams just involve studying.
She was very easy to listen to although the phone policy sucks
I went in not expecting to do much because I heard that it was easy, but I had to put in SOME effort (more than expected).  I made A-'s and B+ on the tests. Advice: Do all of the extra credit if possible. Your final grade can go from a B to an A. It's that serious.
Decent class but she is SO not reasonable. Cuts you off when you try to talk, and DON"T ask for help and don't try to find her for office meeting. She is NEVER available. I left messages on her voice mail never got a call back. I tried to talk to her after class about something I didn't understand she TOTALLY made me feel stupid
Dr. Sorin is by far the best professor I've ever had in my life. She made Biology SO interesting! She relates everything to real life. I've never been interested in Biology until I took this class! Tons of bonus points if you show up, really boosts the grade. I would recommend her to everyone. I wish she taught more classes than Intro to Biology.
She is a fabulous teacher. Makes biology extremely fascinating for non-majors. Obviously slightly liberal but very realistic with things (we talked about AIDs, cancer, and stem cell research in class). Also disproved dumb rumors during class (abortions don't ruin your system when legal- keep that legal!)
Teacher name: Murphy, Kendra
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She is absolutely amazing!
This was my second, and not my last, semester with Ms. Murphy. She is incredibly intelligent and caring about what she teaches, and encourages students to care about it just as much. She's a fair grader and her lectures are very interesting. It is VERY important to read the textbook for class and for the quizzes at the end of the chapters.
Her class is not hard. She does gives quizzes every period over class material. These quizzes are online about 15 questions. She also has a 3 to 5 paper on a deviant act that one has to commit and some discussion post. Overrall, it was not hard. However, One has to pay attention in class to answer the quizzes and discussion post online.
I love this woman! If I had extra finances to take this class or any of her other classes I definitely would! She is a tough grader to some but she is very encouraging and holds the class to high standards. Some topics aren't as interesting as others but she always has personal examples. Hate my time with her is up for now. TAKE HER!
I like Ms. Murphys class. Shes very knowledgeable and she has very interesting stories that she talks about them as relavent example to concepts we learn. Shes probably the best sociology professor at university of Memphis. We did not have tests, just four main papers in addition to online quizzes and participation and attendance.
I really think she's doing these reviews on her own. She's very rude and tries to talk to people like they are children. I'm not a student that's just make bad post about teachers. I'm graduating with an 3.4 GPA so trust me stay away from this class. I left a comment before and its gone so I posted again. Stay away from Kendra Murphy's class.
professor murphy is overall a good teacher although her ego is huge.. she comes off as if she knows everything, and answers students' questions as if someone was always questioning her intelligence. it is an easy class and grade, she allows 3 missed classes before grade is affected, and is very hard on late assignments.
While she came across as a little abrasive at first, Dr. Murphy grew on me by the end of the month. She is straight forward and expects a lot, but she cares about her students and their grades. Class was mostly power point lectures with plenty of class discussions, and at the end of chapters there were easy quizzes. We had no tests.
Dr. Murphy was an easy A if you read the assigned reading, come to class ON TIME, and complete her discussion boards.
Mrs. Murphy truly is a real gem at the University of Memphis. She's raw, real, and honest. Be a good student and she will do her part too. Super interesting lectures. I would take her again if I could.
Was very easy and funny. All you have to do is go to class and do discussion posts and you will pass. Rarely any tests but they were easy as well. Would definitely take her again.
Ms. Murphy is not a tough grader. She give you everything you need to know with plenty of opportunity for questions. Attendance is a big deal Bc she does discussion boards after each lecture. Discussions are super important and goes towards participation. No midterm or final. Just 10-13 easy quizzes. One project which was fun and easy. Recommend
Kendra Murphy is an okay teacher. She does not give extra credit and she is very strict on assignment deadlines. Once you have missed an assignment with probable cause, you cannot make it up! She keeps you in class for the whole entire time!
NO GROUP WORK!! Mrs. Murphy is an amazing teacher that LOVES her job. She respects the students and she takes her job seriously. She is wonderful during her office hours and very ready to help with any issues you may have. She is fair and as long as you do the work and show up for class, you have an A. GREAT. Definitely taking her again!!
She is very helpful and understanding about grades. She had quizzes and discussions to every week and they were pretty easy.
I loveee Dr. Murphy!! I would take her for every class of I could! Like everyone else said, she's strict on being late and cell phones but you won't even mind b/c this class is so worth it! Lectures are easy to understand and she will help you all day long if you need it! I even did my project for another class on her! Take her if you can!
Mrs. Murphy was the best teacher I've ever had. She came off kind of rude at first but she is passionate for Sociology. She's strict on cell phones and showing up late, but it didnt even bother me really. She took daily participation questions on what you were supposed to read for homework-these would make or break you. I definitely recommend
Amazing teacher. Have to put effort in to do good, but if you are interested then you will enjoy her class. You must attend, bell work everyday on reading. If you do a general skim of chapter then you should pass bell work fine.
My favorite teacher. I had her in the fall and still wish I was in her class. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Made you wont to come to class. Very passionate about teaching. I would love to take her again. Attendance is very important. So is listening to her in class. Gives information out kind of fast, but if you ask she will allow you to record her lectures.
This class is super interesting and she makes it that way. Besides teaching from powerpoints she throws in her personal experiences to give examples. Class goes by super fast. DO NOT BE LATE! She has a huge problem with cell phones and tardies so be aware, but other than that she is a great professor to have for this class.

Teacher comments: 
She is wonderful at teaching the material, giving us every single edge we can, i.e. teaching us the easy calculator solution before the full algebraic solution. But the content is still quite hard. She puts on a very hostile attitude. Visit her office hours and you will see that she is quite nice, just stern. Quizes every class period, lots of HW.
The lectures aren't that interesting, but overall this is a good class. You can use your notes on all the tests, but the tests are difficult. There are 2 exams, 2-30 minutes presentations, and homework checks randomly. As long as you do what you're supposed to and study a little, you can pass this class.
Moves quickly through the material. If you don't show up you won't pass. Do the homework and you should understand the material.
She does not care about you unless you have an advanced understand of Calculus. Does not give extra credit does not curve does not help students who are struggling.
Dr. Grant is a great teacher. Lectures are fast-paced and require your full attention, but just like almost every other thing in life, you will do well if you pay attention, put in the work, and show up. She explains everything clearly . There is a 2-question quiz at the end of every class and get ready to SHOW YOUR WORK ON THE TESTS!
Had a hard time getting through the class and it was difficult to get help especially since she brushed it off as if I didn't matter. Very fast paced class and if you miss even a single day you will more than likely fail the tests. She does a good job teaching but good luck trying to get help from her.
Great teacher, explains things well, but don't zone out for a second because you will be lost for the rest of the lecture. Each class ends with a two question quiz and if you even get one wrong you'll get a failing grade.
Dr. Grant is an amazing professor. If you don't care, your grade will show it. People who show up late will not get sympathy. She is easy to follow and understand, and asks if everyone understands. She always stays on track, and no time is ever wasted. You will definitely be forced to learn, because otherwise you will fail quick.
Awful teacher. Does not explain concepts concretely. Avoid taking her
The daily quizzes she gives will KILL your grade, especially if you dont get the concept immediately. A weekly quiz would be fine, but one every single day? Ridiculous.
She is a strict but good teacher. Attendance is necessary to pass because the material is hard to understand if you don't attend lectures. Don't expect above a B in the class unless you have a good foundation for calculus or you are willing to put the time into the class.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS (although hard to because she teaches most of cal 1 &amp; 2 classes). Grade consists of only 4 tests and a final. Material is not hard, but tests are nothing like review or material gone over. There is no hope for this class. A lot of people fail.
As a teacher she is fine, however the grading format is horrendous. There are four tests and a final, hence there is no chance to learn which topics you're weak on beforehand. After the test the topic is not touched on until the final. This is a flawed system. Calculus is simple, but with this grading format it gives no time to PRACTICE weak areas.
She is rude to say the least. She grades very hard on her tests. She no longer use the onine assignments program so the only grades are the 4 tests and final. Good luck on those. She dont like going into debt when you ask further questions she will just say" well thats just algebra. "
no word to explain her...
She is not really good at explaining things.
She is a mean, hateful teacher.  Very unapproachable.  I wouldn't even dare take a college algebra class with her.
No Help what so ever. Good luck if you have her.
Do your homeworks early and you'll get good grades. Classworks, Quizzes, and Tests are straight from the homeworks. 30 minutes before class ends, you are asked to complete some online problems that's graded so be sure to study beforehand. DON'T be late on final exam day. Everything is online, do the works and you'll pass.
She doesn't want to help you at all. Bestablished thing I can say about her is her class is well laid out and her work is easy if you know what to do. I was in AP calculus in high school and even she made me mad!!!! She always starts answering question with "you should have learned this in high schoo." I never dared to ask her a question.

Teacher comments: 
Very good, very engaging professor who grades on few things but prepared the class well
Provided outlines for lectures and exams, will go over exams before class. Must attend to pass. However, you arent getting moneys worth by taking him. He will cancel class often.. Can be rude to people showing up late, so be on time. He acts like he is never wrong on a subject. Overall, nice class and teacher. But isnt worth it.
Dr. Houston is a brilliant man. He obviously knows what he's talking about and the way he presents the material makes the class interesting. There are 3 exams and a paper, all of which are fairly easy as long as you go to class because the outlines he gives are not very detailed. He also goes over the study guide the day before the exam.
He is one of my favorite professors! He is easy and cares about your grade. I took legal/forensic psych and made an A! His notes are not that detailed, however attendance and taking notes help. There will be 3 exams and a paper due. Show up+ listen+ take notes A
I took him for intro to psyc on TR, and we almost never stayed the full class period. best pre-req professor and class.
I had a difficult time understanding his method of teaching, however I managed to make it through the course. I really appreciate that he makes himself available to assist you with assignments,
Inspiring and fair. If you land in his class, you will not be sorry. Makes learning fun. I respect him a great deal.
Dr. Houston is a great teacher. He was my first psychology teacher in college and then I took him for forensics. He is smart, funny, wants you to learn, patient, fair, and a real asset to the university. I really enjoy the lectures. Real down to earth guy.
I stopped going to the lecture about halfway into the semester because I realized it was pointless. EVERYTHING is in the book that he teaches. He let out early though so that was pretty nice and if you do go to the lecture it's pretty interesting. There's a lot of outside work that he rarely talks about. Too much to keep up with sometimes.
Very interesting class. There was no book and tests were based off his lectures.  I liked that attendance was not mandatory however I would not recommend skipping many classes because the tests were solely based off the lectures. He does hand out study guides though! Easy A as long as you pay attention!
Dr. Houston was  a cool enough teacher; but he taught more law than forensic psych. The first half of the semester was just an overview of how courts work rather than how psychology factors in. For many of us, that's disappointing as that is not what the course description promised. Don't take if you want to learn Forensic Psych
Amazing Teacher! I love lecture style classes, and if you do as well, you'll love this class. He makes them very interesting and I always expected to laugh in the class. His tests are easy if you come to class. Also, he seems to really love his job which is refreshing .
His Legal &amp; Forensic class was pretty easy. The class was an hour and 25 minutes, but he rarely ever went past 35 minutes. His outlines are exactly like the exams which there are three of (multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions). There was also a paper on a topic of your choice. I did the bare minimum and still did well on everything.
He made the lecture interesting and we were let out of class early most of the time
Very easy class as long as you come to class,pay attention and take good notes. There isn't a book and he doesn't teach from notes but from an outline that you will have. His tests are multiple choice,short answer and an essay question. His study guide will tell you the essay questions and a few of the short answer.
No textbooks or power points. I am usually an A/B student and currently struggling. Do not take him if you are a visual learner. short classes.
3 tests and a paper, but he was a very easy grader. Lectures have everything you need to know for the test, and remember to take good notes. Definitely an easy A.
I took Dr. Houston last semester for social psychology. The lectures were short and he started class ON TIME. I recommend people to record the lectures and take clear notes. The notes will help you pass the tests. A short paper was assigned- max 5pgs. This class is an easy A as long as you take good notes. He also took time to go over study guides.
I am taking Dr. Houston now for social psychology. His lectures are short, he runs through them pretty fast. Its best to record him. We have 3 exams and a paper. The paper was fairly easy and the the exams are too as long as you take notes and record his lectures. Study guides are provided which he goes over a class period before the test.
Dr. Houston is by far my favorite professor at U of M. I have had multiple classes with him and enjoyed every one. There was a time when i was in a sticky situation and he cut me some slack. He is very understanding and intelligible. I would highly recommend to anyone.
Teacher name: Lukawitz, James
School name: University of Memphis

Teacher comments: 
Completely unorganized for his online course. Everything on the syllabus had the wrong dates and wrong location for tests/quizzes. Things would be listed as ecourseware but would be in mybusinesscourse or elsewhere. Group exam, so good luck getting people to do this on an online course so you will probably end up doing it yourself.
Honestly one of the worst college classes I have ever taken. Grades cases ridiculously hard with mediocre and picky reasons to why he gives you 70s on each case. Doesn't give full credit on anything, even evaluations. If you don't give the answer he wants or you don't laugh at his sometimes mean jokes, youR grades will reflect it. GOOD LUCK
Great Professor, does not give any curves or weighted grades so it is pretty easy to keep up with everything. He does give some chances for a few points of extra credit, but not enough to change your grade very much. Very helpful, emails class notes to everybody after lectures
Professor Lukawitz is a very good teacher. There is no textbook, only lectures/powerpoints and the option to take the final if you didn't like your mid-term grade. That said, you are completely doomed if you get some bad apples in your group, as your grade will be affected based on their performance as well. Take the class with a smart friend.
Exams can be difficult(done in groups), if you didn't do the homework, or read your emails. He sent many examples to follow in emails to complete the exams. If you make anything less than a B in the class it's because you didn't try. You got to drop the final exam if you did well on the first 2 exams. I like how the class was structured.
STEER CLEAR. Only take this class as your last option. HW takes over 4 hours to complete and is HARD. The first deadline was not until the end of October. Exams are impossible. He offers little to no feedback and does not seem to care. I've made straight As and Bs the past 4 years but not this semester thanks to the C I'm getting in this class.
Class is all lecturestudent presentation. Do all critiques and write-ups to max scores - why give away points? Be prepared to put time IN on group presentations - students can be tougher graders than prof. No textbook. Choice of mid term or final - essay format, can be done as group. Expects good work &amp; rewards it. Good class. Would take again.
Good instructor - had him in person and online. Responds to questions promptly. Good videos to explain material. Exams are not just multiple choice from database - each has separate problem set to test concepts and he does allow groups to work together on them. Do the discussions posts - good way to earn extra points. One of the best at UM.
This class is not hard, but it requires a lot of work. Expect to do case studies the whole semester and group projects. No book required, and he is a super enthusiastic professor. I enjoyed his teaching just not the case studies!
Try to get a good group. 2 presentations and 10 mini-projects.
Class is all about group presentations, but in a good way. He brings a depth to accounting not expected from the class. He is always ready to help. Once I stopped him in hall and he acted like I was the only thing on his mind as he helped me understand something. Later I found out I made him late to an appointment and he never complained.
If you attend class on lecture days, he will give you everything you need to complete the cases. Also, when you pick a group, pick it early! The first few groups have the easier cases to present. We didn't use a book.
Great lecturer. Makes accounting come alive. Very helpful. Always in a good mood and eager to help. This is the most positive accounting professor I've come across. Makes me proud to study accounting.
good teacher
Great Professor! Talks kind of fast so you have to keep up. Very funny and uses examples to help you get a better understanding of the material.
I've had Lukawitz for four classes, including my advanced accounting class this semester, and he is BY FAR my favorite accounting teacher! Of course he isn't easy, but he wants you to actually learn the material. You can email him any time and he'll answer or go by his office. He really helps his students. Wonderful teacher.
This class is really hard. I took it online so I basically had to teach my self. There's online homework in connect, a quiz and a project. And 3 exams. The material is hard BUT HIS GRADING SCALE MAKES IT EASY TO PASS! I didn't get above a 70 on any of my exams but I did well on everything else and I got a B in the course
Do not take him for this course ONLY!!! Has not taught intermediate in over 20 years, tends to ramble and get off track, and most importantly this is a lot of material to learn in 5 weeks. Would not advise to take this course in summer school at all!!!!
The case style of the class is very engaging. Don't be a bump on a log, discuss things with him, and get to know him - it will help. Coming to class outside of case days is pointless and I NEVER used the reference book. The course is a good change of pace from other upper lvl acct classes. If you want to talk to him go see him, doesn't answer email
I was upset at first cause I signed for Spiceland, but our professor got changed to this guy.He was very boring and made the same lame jokes, however he did give a curve on your final grade.I calculated my final grade and I made a 84, but my final grade was an A, so we are talking about a 6-8 point curve on your final grade.Just do all the e-z work
Teacher name: Larkin, Dan
School name: University of Memphis

Teacher comments: 
Taking this intro to philosophy class with Dr. Larkin has opened my eyes to understanding philosophy better. He is a great professor and is always open to answer questions. Not attending his class really upsets him (but if you are there, you will receive extra credit points). There is alot of reading to do, but the assignments are easy.
Doctor Larkin is the best! I love his lectures and he will definitely make you laugh! Make sure you read though, because you will not know what is going on. Also make sure you actually participate in class, because it makes a big difference in your grade!
Lectures daily but the lectures are interesting class discussions.
As long as you read the material and try to speak or ask questions in an engaging manner (and show up for class), you will enjoy and learn a lot from this class. A simple, easy, and enjoyable class with an energetic and eccentric professor.
I learned so much in this class and even use the arguments I learned here in some of my other classes. Didn't ever even want to skip. Every time I thought the reading pretty much covered it all, he had more to say about the topic. I feel like I learned a lot of history and other types of philosophy just from the examples and anecdotes he gives.
Dr. Larkin is the best professor I've ever had. If more professors were like him college would be so much more enjoyable. His lectures are interesting, he makes Philosophy interesting even when it's hard to understand, and he truly cares that everyone understands the material rather than giving homework/assignments. His "tests" are papers! Easy!
He is just an overall amazing teacher.
Dan is the whole reason Im now a philosophy major. The coolest professor Ive ever had, hands down. He really cares about what hes teaching, and it shows.
This class is so great. He gives real-life experiences in relation to what he's teaching. I really feel like a learn something every day I go to his class that helps me open my eyes to the world around me. So yeah without a doubt if you're going to take this class you'll enjoy it.
I love Dan Larkin with all my heart. Not only is he a total babe but he makes class very easy to come to because you know you'll be entertained and really learning what is being taught. He's passionate about everything he's teaching and he really works to form a relationship with his students and make sure they are confident in the material.
Dr. Larkin is an amazing professor! I took his last semester, but he still inspires me to this day. I was terrified of taking a phil. class because I was afraid I could not understand the dense readings, but Dan went over literally everything in each class. He is super understanding and funny. If you go to class, there's nothing to worry about.
Dr. Larkin is a fun energetic professor.  His lectures are great and he encourages you to challenge him.
Dan is by far, my favorite Professor at U of M. His lectures keep you engaged, he has a real passion for what he teaches, and he cares about his students. You would have to TRY to fail his class because of all the help he offers. He will meet with you after class, give you pointers for your papers, and explain things 12 times if thats what you need
Dr. Larkin was a caring professor, that explained mistakes to help you succeed on the next paper. Make sure you do not skip class, and if a lot of you skip class he will give pop quizzes. There is also a lot of reading for the class too.
Dan's fervor and ardor are intoxicating and contagious. I've said a million times that I wish Dan could teach all of my classes. Dan Larkin makes philosophy accessible to everyone, people who are are exceptionally adept at reading dense musings, and those who may have trouble understanding it. You don't really need the book but you would do better.
Dr. Larkin is genuinely amazing, and genuinely wants the best for his students. The papers require a lot of thinking, but it is worth it! Take him! You will learn so much!
Mr. Larkin (or Dr. Larkin), is cool. The class is cool. He likes his rules, so follow them. He likes to joke so thats a plus.  Compared to other classes, this one has a light load especially if you like to read.  P.s. If u like to skip class, dont take him. #PopQuizes #EasyHomework #NoMercy
Really Funny!  Definitely keeps your attention every class.  Only downside was that there was a LOT of reading.  Dan explains it all in class though.  Take him.
He is an amazing professor. His lectures are engaging and interesting.  He knows the material well and is heavily invested in student success.  Would 100% recommend taking this professor.
A more apt name for this class would be "Dan's life class." My favorite thing about Dan is he doesn't take sides. He genuinely wants to explore all sides to an issue. My only criticism is directed at the other students in the class. As with every philosophy or English class, get ready to experience some of the most extra people you'll ever meet.
Teacher name: Sackett, Ross
School name: University of Memphis

Teacher comments: 
He is a great professor, really knows everything about anthropology and is very passionate about it. Very lecture heavy and showing up for class is your best bet!
Dr. Ross was by far the best professor I have had since I transferred to the U of M. The class was pretty intense since I'd never had an Anthropology class before, but it was bearable. Also please DO NOT SKIP CLASS! Missing one class period is equivalent to missing a whole week of lectures in my opinion. I would definitely take him again!
His class is challenging but his lectures are very engaging. He's really a stand up professor,I'd highly recommend him!
He's always enthusiastic, funny, and tries to keep the lectures interesting. A "study guide" is provided before each tests, which mentions the topics on the test and it makes things a whole lot easier. However, the lectures are heavy and there are only 3 (really hard) tests, so you don't want to miss classes! Definitely recommend him!
We were asked to read from the book for more information, but that's it. He is a real funny guy, but the tests are just naturally hard. Come on. Its fossils and dirt, its going to be a little challenging. But hey, at least pick a teacher that has a lot of charisma and enthusiasm! 10/10 rating!
Truly cares about anthropology. Great personality! Tests are hard so be sure to study!!
I loved this class so much and really enjoyed the teacher he made everything really interesting and he was very friendly and funny. The key to passing is just paying attention and studying the study guides everything is very clean cut and clear in this class!
Dr. Sackett is great! He really cares about this class and his lectures for this class are never boring! He goes the extra mile to help you understand it and make it interesting. However, you need to go to class to pass period.... Just study his lectures, study guide topics, and make flash cards and you will do fine.
Sackett is one of my favorite professors of all time and one of the best at the U of M.  He is incredibly knowledgeable and his lectures are very interesting. He has so much passion and excitement in what he does. If you go to class, take notes and study, you will do well. Highly recommend! Never missed a class because it was so interesting!
THE BEST OF THE BEST I LIKE HIM SO SO SO MUCH, HE IS VERY NICE . ALWAYS SMILING, HE KNOWS WHAT HIS DOING VERY SMART I ENJOYED HIS CLASS.
Great professor and a great advisor to boot. Really good at making confusing topics exciting.
He's an amazing professor and is easily in my top five. His lectures are heavy, but if you pay attention, read the assignments, and go over your notes you'll pass. He has definitely influenced me into considering to being an ANTH major. He really cares about teaching and is enthusiastic about doing so. Not much homework is assigned either.
Great teacher. Lectures were long. Take really good notes and study ALOT for the tests. The class is not bad though, I enjoyed it. A couple of homework assignments in the first two weeks of class, but that's it.
AWESOME!! One of my favorite professors of being here for 4 years at Memphis. I highly recommend taking this class. You won't want to miss because the info is so interesting! Study the study guide, go to class, take notes and you will pass!
This is the man who convinced me to major in Anthropology over subjects I thought I was more interested in. His love for the subject shows in every lecture - even when he's sick, he's animated and engaging. I don't think he knows how much of an impact he had on me, as I wasn't an ANTH major, but he changed my life irreversibly for the better.
He is a great professor who makes class interesting. However, if you aren't interested in Anthropology it will be easy to zone out during class.  If you do not read the chapters in the book and listen to his lectures then you will not pass the tests. He talks  really fast so I decided to buy a recorder to listen to the lectures later.
One of the best professors ever. Wants you to pass but Anthropology is not an easy topic. It does require work and studying. Not an easy A but I would take the class just because of Sackett. It is still very possible to pass the class with a good grade. ATTENDANCE IS IMPORTANT Miss more than 4 days, your grade is affected. Miss 9 days and fail.
I would recommend everyone from any major to take this class! He is the most enthusiastic &amp; inspiring teacher I've ever had. He is a really really smart guy &amp; is FULL of interesting stories. The subject matter is easy to understand he puts his all into.  This class changes how you look at life and challenges what you think you know about evolution.
He says this on the first day, but if you go to class and take a lot of notes, you will have an easier time in the class. His lectures are lengthy, but very informative. Three tests that include stuff from lectures and the book. Loved this class.
Sackett is  interesting, true enough but being interesting is not going to help you pass his class; he assigns three hard exams that covers extremely long lectures. he gives grading curve but its not as  effective;he assigns no extra credit
Teacher name: Caldwell, Mar
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Tests are online.  Lectures are entertaining.  Just do the homework, and you can get an A.
I took her for Racial/Ethnic minorities and didn't expect her to know or teach much when I saw her, however she knows what she's talking about and is funny-odd way. She talks about school sports everyday and sitting through her long lectures are totally boring. She wants to hear what students have to say. All Test online-heavy. Good PowerPoints.
Attendance is mandatory, but her class is really easy. Four tests (all online and no class that day) and all the answers are in the book so get the book. She's really funny and a great teacher. I would love to take her again!
Bless Mrs. Caldwell's heart, she not technically savvy! The lab portion of this class was a disaster, I bought a flash drive that was defective.  I got a replacement and never opened it and passed her class with a B-.  Often people would sign her role and leave her class, the lectures are a bit boring.  In my opinion, you will need your book.
There was a lot of problems because the computer locked up while taking my first exam. The teacher didn't know how to reset the exam.  Which caused problems because you're not able to retake your exam until the end of the semester. You cannot use your lecture notes or your book. Which lessens your chances for a good  grade.
Very very boring. If you want a early morning class to sleep in this the one. She post everything she talks about in class. She tries to be funny but its a very dry class. Wouldn't recommend if you don;t need it. It's simple stuff about different races such as African Americans, Asians, Mexicans.
Great teacher. There's no homework and she only grades you on 4 exams and attendance. Her lectures are kind of boring, but her slides are online and that helps a lot when you go to study for the exams.
very easy class test online no need for book all slides online
Most boring class ever. She talks so slow. But if you can sit through the class long enough, she goes over the study guides for tests and tells you exactly what you need to know. Ask her about anything on the guide, and again she'll tell you everything. I highly recommend that you record what she says on your phone or recorder. Tests are online.
enjoyed class and would take again
For me, the test were online. You need to take notes on what she says because she words her test in her own way. There are not many test so you need to make sure you do well. DONT MISS CLASS. She WILL count off if your not there. Other than that pretty easy. DONT BUY BOOKS. We never used them. Unless you want it to help find answers for test.
She's honestly a really easy professor. Come to class because attendance was worth as much as a test grade. She goes off topic in her lectures and rarely ever finishes the lessons. However, she puts the powerpoints and study guides online. If you study them, you will get a good grade.
I liked her , I guess. If you can handle the occasionally boring lecture, you'll be fine. Class is mandatory because if you miss without an legitimate excuse points will be taken from your attendance grade and those point for showing up could help in the long run. Test are not very hard, study guide and powerpoints online. Good Luck.
This is my third time taking Mrs. Caldwell. One reason is because she is very easy to pass. She has every power points for each chapter and has the study guides so be prepare for the exams.
I took intro to sociology excited to get my major in it. That excitement died in this class. I was tettering on a B and a C and reached out to her for some helpful study pointers. I emailed her and didn't got a response. I asked her in person after class and got a vague answer. Then on her final exam I made a 78 even though she knew I worked hard.
Go in and sign the roll. No assignments. No hw. No quizzes. Don't buyneed book. Overall nice, easy going, and vivid teacher but lectures are pretty boring. Only thing is that her study guides don't always match to what is being tested and even though that's a big deal, her overall being, demeanor, willingness to help makes up for it.
Her class was a little boring for me. She was entertaining and explained everything we needed, but I didn't really enjoy her class. She is nice and helpful.
I'm concerned she is developing Alzheimer's. She will repeat the same irrelevant anecdotes 5-6 times, with no apparent recognition that she is repeating herself. The class is so easy, it's a joke. I never read the book and I never studied. Great for an easy A and a study period. Sit in the back and you won't even have to look up the whole time.
Ms. Caldwell is a nice teacher but she is annoying. She also lost one of my test grades and I literally had to ask her for months in order for her to fix it. Overall, I would not recommend her to anybody.
She is very nice and provides opportunities for extra credit. The book is not mandatory. Tests are easy if you attand class and take good notes. Class can be very boring at times.

Teacher comments: 
ExcellentDr Campbell is caring students, his teaching method hilarious lecture. It is U of Memphis has such an awesome professor! A+
One of my favorite teachers. Very honest. So funny and smart. Gives feedback if you ask.
He's a great professor who really knows what he's talking about. If you need help go to him in office hours or any other time you can meet and he will help you with all your questions. If you don't go to class then you won't do well on the tests. All his tests are short answer and essay questions. If you don't like writing, beware!
awesome!
Dr. Campbell is the reason I became an economics major. His lectures are witty and engaging. He also gives a lot of extra credit opportunities as well as a drop test.  I have taken him for over 4 of my Economics course and will continue to take his classes at every opportunity.
Dr. Campbell was a great professor!  He is very clear with what he expects from you.  Funny guy, and loves to interact with his students.  I took him for 2 different classes,and loved him. He takes attendance, but isn't "mandatory" BUT it may be considered when he is calculating grades. Just show up and take notes.. Easy A.
He is the best professor i have had so far! Super funny and makes the class interesting and if you take notes, you will have all the answers to do great on the tests. And man is he nice to look at.
Made the class interesting.
Dr. Campbell made class fun.  This is the only class I didn't skip all semester because I loved going so much. I didn't need the book at all, the test questions are straight from his lecture notes. He's hilarious too!
Good ole Doug.  I absolutely loved him.  Such an easy class if you pay attention and do all of the extra credit and homework.  Tests aren't too hard, either, and he makes things interesting.  He's pretty funny, too, and mentions his "selfie duals".  I'm taking him again for Micro next semester.  Great guy and great professor.
The best professor! Everything that he has been awarded at this university, he completely deserves. He actually made economics enjoyable which can be hard to do. He keeps class interesting with witty stories that relate to the topic, but he is extremely professional all at the same time! Exams are fair, just study which he always emphasizes to do
This is my morning class so I had a lot of trouble actually waking up and going to it.  But I still went most of the time because the lectures were interesting and Campbell was a funny professor.  Read the book and you'l l be fine for the tests
Dr.Campbell is an awesome professor! He's very knowledgeable &amp; enthusiastic which makes his class a joy to be in. I knew nothing about econ prior to taking his classes &amp; it's now my minor. Attendance isn't required but a must if you want a good grade. Tests are over lessons in class but it helps to read the book as well. Definitely recommend him!
Dr. Campbell is a great professor. He is very energetic and entertaining. He is also very smart and an all around nice guy. He does his best to keep the class interested and the work load is very reasonable. If you pay attention and try, you should do just fine. He is also hip. TAKE HIM! He's the best!
He's an awesome professor. He's very passionate and he makes things easy for everyone to understand. I'm an Economics major, and his class seemed to be easy enough for all.
4 exams. First three, drop one, remaining two = 50% of your grade. Fourth is mandatory comprehensive = 30% of grade. HW is 20% and on line. Gave us extra credit work that added 5 points to FINAL average. Attend every class, take good notes, and get easy A. Lazy student beware. He teaches very well, learning from book is very hard. Attend class.
Best Professor ever. Class discussions were very interesting and helpful to the subject at hand. Follows the book. Definitely study for tests, but if u study maybe for 2-3 hours(reasonable) you should do fine.
I loved this class! Prof.Campbell is by far the best professor i've had. He is very engaging with the class and makes the lesson as clear as possible. Definately recom. this professor.
Easily the best professor I have had in college so far. You definitely have to study, but he is always very engaged in teaching and isn't too bad to look at either
Dr. Campbell is amazing! He made the class interesting. DO ALL OF THE EXTRA CREDIT PROBLEMS! Ask him what CD he's going to buy for more extra credit. Also ask him about his first night in Memphis! Book is ONLY for extra credit problems. Exams = everything he writes on the board! 3 exams plus the final. He drops one exam grade. I got an A.

Teacher comments: 
Mrs. Freeman is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She is young and cool so she is very good at relating to her students. She shows us that she cares and if you meet with her after class and show her you care as well, you will for sure be on her good side and get every chance at an A. She is also a crazy math genius!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE her!!! I can"t see how anyone could ever have a problem with this class. What was expected was very clearly laid out and she teaches at a good pace until everyone understands. Awesome. Taking her again next semester. Finished with an A.
Attendance is ridiculously mandatory. Homework can be five pages long assigned on Tuesday and due Thursday morning. I stressed over my grade but homework seemed to be weighted lightly. Tests are easy if you show up and do the work. Disappointed that there is no tech or education major bent. All pen/paper arithmetic. No lesson plans or smart boards.
Super easy class!! Homework is assigned every night but its only 12 problems max and all on my math lab so you have as many chances as possible to get a 100. Show up to class, do the homework and light studying for the tests and you'll pass this class no problem
Great teacher, willing to slow down and help. If she makes a mistake while teaching, she accepts corrections well. Classes aren't difficult but do have a lot of homework but she tells you what will need to be turned in or not.
Really easy class! She's super nice and wants you to pass.
Professor Freeman is literally one of the most sweetest and understanding professors you will ever have! She really breaks down the material and helps you learn well. She makes sure you have all the information you need to study for tests too! Great professor!
This class is ridiculous for education majors. She is such a hard grader! No calculators at all! Whole grade based off of like 6 four questions quizzes and 3 tests. No pony for effort either! She is a cold woman
Professor Freeman is an awesome professor.  Take her for any math course you have the chance to.  She wants her students to do well.  She prepares you for the tests and quizzes so nothing comes as a surprise.  I highly recommend Professor Freeman!
Ms. Freeman is the actual best! I took her for both 1710 and 1730 and made A's in both classes.  She explains concepts clearly and makes sure everyone understands before moving on.  Definitely would take her again!
Mrs. Freeman is awesome.  Three tests and a final exam.  She reviews very well and lets you know exactly what will be on them.  A few quizzes and sometimes takes up homework for a quiz grade.  Very willing to help you understand and encourages questions.  Wants you to pass.  Great professor overall!
Cant use a calculator, so if youre not 100% on basic arithmetic, expect to fail. Only 4 tests and 10 quizzes - homework and attendance dont count for anything. She makes you feel stupid for asking questions and is so confusing with her lectures. She has no sympathy and is a tough grader. If you have any other options, dont take her class.
Very good at making sure everyone understands the material.
Mrs. Freeman is great! Explains everything clearly, encourages you to come see her if you need help with something, and she is so sweet. If you don't understand something she won't make you feel stupid, she will work with you until you get it. Tests are only 20 questions each, but she replaces your lowest score with your final exam grade.
Freeman is a fantastic professor. She is extremely sweet and will make sure everyone understands the material. Attendance is only really required if you need to meet criteria for a scholarship but it has no real affect on your grade. The tests are just easier versions of the homework , do the homework and you will pass with ease.
A bit boring (she basically just reads what the book says) but VERY helpful and thorough. Lots of online homework. Tests can be tricky, but it's all multiple choice. If you study, you can easily get an A.
Freeman is extremely nice and does well in explaining the material and taking questions if there are any. If you pay attention and do the homework, her class isn't hard at all.
Freeman is really nice and is willing to help. It's a big class though and it's easy to skip class, but dont you'll get behind.  It's like math that kind of applies to math so it's boring.  She just projects the book on the screen and talks about it.  You don't need the book unless you just want to refer to for homework. The homework is all online.
She teaches way too much information for one test! it is very confusing.She does not put all of the conversions on the test. The tests are hard! Do Not Take Her if you want to past
Shes very soft spoken and doesnt care about attendance I didnt use a book for this class and still passed. Shes very nice and willing to help those who want to be helped.
Teacher name: Oliver, Diana
School name: University of Memphis
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Ive taken her intro to psyc class and human sexuality with her.  I really like her classes. Don't fall asleep and pay attention. You really don't need the textbook.
Professor Oliver is great as long as you follow her rules. She can get a bit nasty at times but that is only when her class is interrupted. She does not take roll because of class size, her lectures and power points are clear, and her exams go right with the lectured material. Study the key terms and slides and come to class and you will pass.
She was easily one of my favorite instructors. She puts her notes online and she does not put anything on the test that isn't on her powerpoints. She also makes study guides and practice tests for each of her tests. Only bad thing is you CANNOT use your cellphone whatsoever in that class or bring beverages.
Dr. Oliver is great! She is funny and gets off topic a bit, but that is fine because the more work you cover the sooner the test, so let her talk!!!! She gives lots of extra credit (DO ALL OF THEM!!!) Her lectures are long and you will not do well on her test if you do not study.. Don't show up late and not phones!
Dr. Oliver's a great teacher, she's educated in her field and knows how to deal with students properly. I've throughly enjoyed her class, but I've had to work extremely hard to receive a passing grade. The material's lengthly and the lectures are long; you'll need to sacrifice a lot of time in order to pass willingly. But, if you work, you pass.
In this class there are 2 papers and 3 tests.  She gives extra credit opportunities on tests and do them because it helps your grade a lot. Tough grader on papers!
Her class was very easy. I would definitely recommend taking her for PSYC 1030. She uploaded her powerpoints online and even bolded and put all of the important terms in red. She also gave study guides. There was extra credit if you showed up to class. Just don't piss her off and come to class late or she will make a scene.
She was awesome. Going to class helps cause sometimes she gives extra notes for test answers. We did not use the book, I would not get it unless you just want it to read later in life. Gives bonus. Easy tests. Grades papers kind of tough, but I got an A and so can you.
Great teacher,class is easy as long as you show up. Plenty of extra credit but do not show up late or sleep or she will call you out and do not use your cellphone. Class is entertaining at times and her tests are easy if you study.
She is a real strict old school teacher, however she gives a lot of easy extra credit, and prepares you well for the test if you attend class. Overall she is easy if you make the effort to come to class! vI loved her and wished she taught my thinking and cognitive psych class!
I Loved this class! She's kinda crazy and has a weird laugh but I think it keeps the class interesting. She gives 3 exams and A LOT of in class and online extra credit. If you show up regularly and study you'll do fine. Don't show up late or sleep she'll make fun of you.
If you know how to follow rules, you will like this class. It requires a lot of studying. I finished the semester with an exact 100 in the class. LOTS of extra credit opportunities. And people aren't kidding about her rules, follow them and you will do just fine.
She seems kind of scary at first, but she's only like that because she knows how college students can be. Don't come in late, or she will call you out. DO NOT use your phone in this class. If she catches you, minus 15 points off your total points. There's only 150 total points in the class (3 tests), but she gives extra credit that helps a lot.
I was afraid of having her at first, but after going to class, I realized she really isn't that bad. DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE! She isn't afraid to call you out in class. Just follow her rules, go to study sessions, and do extra credit and you should get a decent grade
It is very easy to make a good grade in her class if you come to class, study her powerpoints, and take advantage of the extra credit that she gives. Make sure you turn your phone off before you get in the class. She is strict about phones and also tardiness. COME TO CLASS ON TIME. Ended the semester with an A :)
Class is incredibly boring, but easy. She gives you a ton of extra credit, and it is added to your average. SHe is very strict, do not use your phone in class or she takes 15 points off your average. There are 3 tests, all of them come with study guides with about 300 definitions, more or less.
Good teacher. class is easy to follow and entertaining at times. She provides real life stories/ examples to accompany her lectures. I was bored sometimes but overall it is an easy class. All multiple choice tests. If you know the definition to everything on the study guides you will get an A. Never leave during class! She WILL confront you.
As many have said before, she is strict. If you know how to behave yourself,then you will be fine. We need more strict professors like her. She is helpful, funny, and understanding. The class, itself, is not hard. There is no reason to fail the class due to the opportunity to get 20 extra bonus points. She requires a book, but it is for clarity.
This class is so boring. I once daydreamed the whole entire hour and a half class and did not miss a thing. She is extremely boring and I lose focus quickly.
Dr. Oliver is an amazing professor, and she really prepared me for college in general. I was a first semester freshman in her class, and she really helped to get my mindset right for being an adult and a good student. GREAT professor. Not so easy class, but totally worth the effort.
Teacher name: Blackmore, Mark
School name: Portland State University

Teacher comments: 
Helps you the best he can to get you to pass the class. Will even call and email if you are doing poorly to see what is up. Hates the current system of teachers who don't care about student success ($). Homework wasn't too hard. Quizzes each week were based upon notes taken in class. Final was also based upon lecture notes. All-star teacher.
If I could take all my classes with Prof. Blackmore I would. Not only is he super interesting but he is great at teaching. I have never been a fan of anything with Stats but Blackmore changed that. If you take his class and actually put in an effort you will enjoy it and you will pass.
He sets up the class so you get an easy A. You are no required to attend class but if you go to his lectures you will not need to read the textbook. He sets the class up easy and wants you to pass!
He made a traditionally hard class, BA303, easy to understand and did an amazing job of relating finance to the real world. I would definitely take a class taught by him again!
I am almost done with his 303 class. He is one the best there is. Follow what he says and you will pass.  I call him wolf on wall street. Great class lots of fun.
Mark Blackmore is ultimately the best professor I have ever had. He genuinely cares for his students and their success. His lectures are very fun and exciting. Mark makes sure the notes he gives in class are accessible to all students  for studying purposes, and they are great notes!
Best prof ever!
Best teacher I have ever had. Most valuable class I've ever taken.
I'm not even half way done with course and I already love this professor. I was really nervous about taking statistics, but he makes it so easy to comprehend. His lectures are great because he's always so enthusiastic. He really cares about his students , and overall just wants you to do well. By the way, his fashion sense is impeccable . 10/10
Mark Blackmore is an incredible professor! He truly cares about his students and wants everyone to receive an A in his class. His weekly quizzes are super easy if you invest your time and study notes from the class. Homework is easy and he goes over the homework problems in class, so basically you have to attend a class  to know the information!
By far one of the best teachers I have ever encountered. It's clear he's passionate about his subject matter and wants every student to succeed. His lectures are designed so you walk away from the class having a clear understanding of the material, while still being light-hearted and engaging. I thought I would hate taking statistics and I didn't.
GOOD PRO
Professor Blackmore really cares about his students. He wants everyone to be successful in life and in class. This is my 3rd time taking this class, the first two times with different instructors, and I finally passed with a A-. Pay attention, take good notes, do your homework, and follow instructions, you will pass the class!
he is a very nice professor. always thinking about students and helping students pass the class get a higher score.
This was my fourth time registering for the course (dropped before the midterm every other time). Blackmore is GREAT. Reminds you of his expectations frequently and sets up class so you succeds. Offers extra credit and encourages meeting with him if you receive below 80 on anything. Fair and compassionate. Awesome sense of fashion too! Best prof!
I was afraid of stats, but Mark broke it down so that it was understandable. I really enjoyed this class and would recommend him to anyone. He truly cares about his students. There are quizzes weekly, but if you don't do well you can retake them. The same goes for the mid-term.
Pro. Blackmore is a really nice person, and his class is so great that you must take! Your grade would be great if you listen to his lecture and care about quiz and homework.
Inspiring lectures. Material clearly explained in class. Professor cares about students and gives prompt feedback. In class quizzes, midterm and final are solely based on class lectures, therefore if you pay attention in class you are going to get an A, easy!
Cared greatly about the success of the students
Prof Blackmore clearly cares about the success of his students. He also offers insight from years of experience into how what he teaches applies in the real world. I enjoyed his lectures and the class curriculum.
Teacher name: Teuscher, Christof
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Coursework: Presentations, group projects,group discussions, papers All work has an assignment sheet with all requirements for full credit. Just have to read, must be hard for people here. If there is any confusion it is very easy to email or set up an appointment to seek help. Attendance Don't go to college if you don't want to show up for class.
Though I do agree that he's a tough grader and his class is very assignment heavy, if you're participating in class he'll do what he can to see you succeed. Beware of his attendance policy though, he marks you down for being late so try not to have his class be your first of the day. (Especially if you're commuting) Enjoyed his class though!
This freshmen course is ridiculously hard. His expectation is not clear and he would tell you do what you want (but then takes points off because that's not what he wants). Many group projects, and they suck because if your partners screw up, you will receive the penalty too.  A writing class with both final exams and final essays.
This is the worst experience I have ever had in my life. This class is hell and this man will do anything he can to not take responsibility for his awful set up. He is rude and a tough grader, you take pointless quizzes, and have to work hard for a C. Being stuck in this class all year has made me STRONGLY consider transferring schools.
I wouldn't recommend him for any class. He is moody and unpredictable. If you cannot avoid him, don't bother with office hours or lecture. Read any books or watch anything on-line if you can.
Projects are challenging and at the same time they are not crystal clear.
The class assignments helped me in doing comprehensive research on novel topics related to subject. The regular class quizzes enabled me to study regularly and stay on top of the subject preparation. The final class project was challenging and I got an opportunity to implement my theoretical knowledge to a real world problem.
The classes are interactive and be ready to learn and read a lot. The journey will be amazing!!
The courses I took under Teuscher were really challenging and hard . He is really strict when it comes to his code of conduct and a tough grader but he treats everyone equally. His projects, though vague at start eventually helped to clear many of my concepts which also helped in final exams.
Took ECE585, but really liked ECE586. Challenging final project, yet a great learning experience. Teuscher helped me a lot with feedback on the final project report. He also set up Slack for quick questions. Compare to many faculty, he does reply to e-mail quickly. Ask for help and you'll get it. Tough tests and grader, yet treats everyone equally.
Moody, unpredictable. Changes coursework  in the middle of the night via email, just hours before due. Do the reading on your own before lecture. Lectures are dry, and he mumbles. Don't bother with office hours, he will tell you to leave.  Keep your head down and don't ask for help.
Lots of homework and the criteria is unclear. Try to start the assignment way ahead of time so you can ask him to give feedback on it beforehand.
really moody
I had Christof for Life Unlimited and I think that most people would say he isn't a good teacher but I have to completely disagree. He is well overqualified  and has done AMAZING things in his professional career. Most didn't like him because he actually challenged them intellectually. His class changed my life and I would recommend him to anyone.
Christof fails when it comes to helping students and understanding expectations of projects. It is clear he needs to perform better and have a more professional attitude as an advisor.
This is a very interesting class. The course load is pretty heavy, so make sure you know how to manage your time. Be prepared to discuss major topics frequently.
He's pretty unsympathetic in grades.
he is a great teacher to take for a frinq class!
Very down to business in class, often times humerus however. Is willing to further clarify, help, and improve students learning if they took the initiative to ask for help.
The expectations of assignments are sometimes confusing and hard to follow.
Teacher name: Jones, Jason
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I appreciate the timely feedback on every assignment we submitted for his class. He is passionate about his work, student success, and the field of criminal justice. Lots of respect for his work.
Professor Jones is in law enforcement and is also very active in the community, so he really cares about what he's teaching. I enjoyed taking this class online, and would've taken it in person if I could. Not a stressful class; read the material, listen to the lectures, and the class will be interesting while also being easy. DEFINITELY TAKE IT!
Professor Jones does an excellent job of laying out exactly what is expected of you through the term. As long as you pay attention to due dates and make sure you submit all assignments, it shouldn't be hard to get an A. And if for some reason you can't meet the assignment date, just email him - super understanding and will work with you on it!
Everything was awesome for me because it was my first experience in whole my life and I had a chance I going to get other courses with Mr. Jason. so respectful.
As long as you read the lecture and book notes, you'll pass no problem.
I really enjoyed the class. Mr. Jones has a wealth of knowledge that he shares with the students. The scenarios and interactions allow you to practice the techniques that have been taught through reading and lecture. I gained practical skills I can use in my job and everyday life. Thank you.
Jason is an incredible professor. His lectures help to explain and outline much of the reading in the textbook as well as offer real-life examples. He is easy to listen to and I never get bored. There is a lot of reading, and the content can be a bit difficult to comprehend if you don't have any previous experience with criminal justice.
Amazing
Jason Jones has made a career out of Criminal Justice and that comes through in his teachings. He cares about what he is putting into his coursework and it shows. I feel like his passion inspired me to want to not only do well in the course but absorb as much information on the topic I could.
I took this class in the Summer, worst choice. I though this class would be inspirational, but it turned out to be quite boring. This class is about memorizing ethical terms. There are many quizzes mostly on terminology.
thank you great work
Mr. Jones brings lots of experience to his teaching. This real world application of the subject matter helps students connect with the material. His policies are strict but he sets clear parameters. Plan your time wisely, read, study, and you should do fine in the class. He allows some extra credit and was very responsive to questions.
Qualified and passionate to course material, I would recommend not taking the condensed summer term.
This was a great class! Very clear expectations and grading rubric. The professor is experienced and knowledgeable. He doesn't impose his views, rather, lets students come to their own conclusions by exercising the use of ethical frameworks. I would recommend this course to others.
I took CCJ 350 online over the summer which is 4 weeks long vs 10 weeks and it was a heavy load but it was not too much to handle, he made it very clear what had to be done for the week and was very organized. He gives feedback on discussions and lets you know why you missed points. Great teacher
I liked the class. It isn't an easy class, but I took this summer term with a shortened curriculum. It was one of the more challenging but well put together. Ethics is not a subject that deals with morals and common sense like I thought it would be. I think there are many valuable ideals to be learned for future career as well as life in general.
thank you for great class.
I appreciated that he was willing to hear my arguments about why a quiz question was graded incorrectly. He gave me points back and even gave me extra credit for challenging him. He is a fair grader, and he has a lot of experience to back up what he teaches. I recommend him.
Gives good feedback, is respected, and gives great lectures
I LOVED this class! Prof Jones makes the class insanely interesting and fun! We learn so much, make sure you don't skip ANY weekly discussions! The class isn't super difficult, but as long as you do what is asked of you and read the material, you'll do very well! His feedback is also very useful. Definitely would take a class from him again!
Teacher name: Fant, Karla
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Challenging class, but a great intro to programming. She is a master at politely stopping freshmen from hijacking the entire lecture for their own personal circle-jerk. She really really cares about making a difference at PSU and will work with students if they're willing to also put in the work. Allow at least 20hrs/week for those programs though
Her test is so difficult! Also, if you take her lecture, you will get a most difficult demoes! You will not pass it!
Intimidating 1st class. There's lots of opportunities to fail. That said, if you go to class and do the work it's easy. She sets up the material in a way that's easy to consume. She doesn't grade the homework though and her graders do NOT look at it that hard. I got 105% on a project w/mem leaks,a broken destructor, and improperly allocated arrays.
Karla is an institution at PSU, most/all CS students will have her. Great teacher, knows not just what to teach, but when to teach it. She has a planned path for students from 162 to 202, so follow along and you'll be fine. Extremely responsive to emails. That said, if you have previous/outside experience, it will feel slow and boring a lot of time
Took a while to get into the groove of her class structure but once I did it was pretty smooth sailing. Karla's a hilarious lecturer and really passionate about the material and her students. Assignments often have confusing requirements. Tests are challenging but she's a very fair grader.
Karla is an amazing, caring lecturer. There were 5 programs: 3 in C++ using vi/vim/emacs, 2 in Java using IntelliJs IDEA IDE. Midterm and final worth 25 and 35%, two pass/fail coding tests, and two quizzes. Study the Prata chapter reviews and lab manual self-check quizzes. She makes exams by scratch and told us she uses both to choose questions
Assignments written by her tend to have unclear criteria, but she's responsive to e-mail. She's the type of teacher to obfuscate information you don't need to know about only to pull the veil back later (think the 1st-grade teacher who insists there's nothing less than 0 until it's time to learn about negative numbers.)
Karla is phenomenal at designing a class to get you prepared for learning and understanding C++. Her tests are difficult to understand. Read the book. Just do it. Like seriously, half the exam comes from the wording of the book, and no one does it, but it really helps to study for the final and midterm.
When I transferred I sucked at coding and thought maybe I'd chosen the wrong field. Turned out I just hadn't had the right teacher yet. Karla's passion, hilarity and unprecedented enthusiasm for CS transformed me. The demos are tough, but if she fails you, shes honestly trying to help because she thinks you'll struggle in upper division.
If you want to take CS at PDX, you'll have to go through Karla. If you have prior knowledge you will love the 4 hours a week of browsing reddit and hacker news, because attendance is mandatory. Assignments are not difficult if you have any level of prior knowledge, just very time consuming.
A lot of people say this class is extremely difficult. It is not hard; it is time consuming. Expect every assignment to take anywhere from 20-40 hours to complete. It is not that they are hard to do, there is just so much to do with them. They are large programs. Make sure to start your program as soon as you can and you'll be fine.
Karla knows the material very well. She responds to emails almost instantly and gives plenty of opportunities for clarification, questions and extra help. Her courses are hard, but not too hard(except 202 is very difficult/time consuming). Her grading is clear and tests are easy if you review the Lab manuals. Use the TA's and tutors often.
For 10 weeks I received all As, but got an 81% on the final and ended up getting a B in the class. The final is definitely the toughest part of the whole class and is worth 40% of your final grade. Read the textbook on trees and learn some basic BigO on all the data structures.
You dont need the "required" textbooks. You can learn everything from the Labs. I got an A and personally thought the class was easy. I was usually lost when I first got to the lab, but asked lots of questions and was able to pick everything up. People that struggle do not ask enough questions. Do not be embarrassed to ask multiple questions in lab
Lectures were very fast, does not explain things too well to students who don't understand instantly. She is a very good teacher, however I see her as an upper-division teacher instead of an introduction teacher. Having a very intimidating teaching style and being so homework heavy I think scares some people away from continuing at PSU.
Much of the class is learned through labs and homework, I didn't find the lectures particularly useful. The tutors and homework recitations are fantastic when you become stuck. I would strongly suggest skipping CS161 prior to CS162, I didn't take it and had no prior knowledge of programming, seems like a waste of time for an optional class.
While her lectures are very detailed (I recommend using note-taking with audio recordings), the fact that your entire grade can go down the toilet due to her proficiency demo questions being completely random is completely unacceptable. I get this is to mirror an interview, but my entire GPA shouldn't be held hostage because of a random question.
If you're taking CS at Portland State, you don't really have any other options for the freshman sequence. Karla is a fine teacher, though you will be treated like a bit of a baby in 162 and 163.
Karla is not bad but her style never really worked for me. To be fair, I didn't much care for the topic and will not be continuing CS classes. She is responsive to e-mails and nice, overall. There was an incredible amount of work, though, which is apparently the case for the rest of her classes.
I learned far more from the home work then I did from the lecture or the lab. I would have been better off practicing on my own.
Teacher name: Sheagley, Eric
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Not enough time on very math heavy tests. You're allowed a full 8.5x11 note sheet for the exams but no matter what you put on them, that material is never on the test (I've been through 5 of his exams and no one I've spoken to has been successful in prepping a good note sheet for him). Attendance optional, but graded questions each session so....
Dr. Sheagley is a great instructor. He is concise during lectures and wants you to do well. As long as you go through powerpoints, read the textbook, and have a good understanding of the material, you will pass the class. Chemistry is a difficult subject, so make sure to put in a study time to understand concepts/equations. He usually curves tests.
Took CH221 last term and CH222 this term. Its a chemistry class its going to be hard but he is the best chemistry teacher Ive ever had. He is very accessible outside of class and truly wants to help his students. The only downside is the limited amount of time on the tests but he does round grades pretty often.
I only participated in class and took the workshop class too. Didnt do Mastering Chemistry and I didnt read the textbook ever. Still was able to get an A. Tests dont give you enough time, but fairly easy content. Just pay attention in class and take notes. He suggests you do the exercises in the textbook to be successful as well.
Dr. Sheagley is a great instructor; he makes it clear that he will not give you a grade, you have to earn it. Lectures are fun and intriguing, tests are challenging (a page of notes is allowed); he gives good feedback and readily corrects any errors found on tests/slides. Participation is necessary through clicker questions and group worksheets.
Tough teacher. Read the book. Did all mastering chemistry. Got an A in lab. Studied the exam prep sheet and still didnt do well on exams. For once I wish an exam prep sheet was actually useful towards the tests.
He's made a few mistakes in the powerpoints, but has thus far always been amiable and thanked whoever pointed it out. Often does random experiments in class for no other reason than for the hell of it.
Beware taking this terror class, YOU WILL GET SWAMPED. After the first week, you'll be knee deep in work that the Shaggy will bamboozle you with by solving the problems a different way everytime. When it comes to the exams, you are toast. Get used to running marathons, cuz that's what it feels like with his time limits. Your life will only be chem
It's a chemistry class, it's hard. Sheagley has hard tests, but if you practice outside of class an A isn't impossible. He's extremely accessible outside of class and his office hours are splendid. If you don't take his class serious, he probably won't take you serious
Sheagley made me very interested in chemistry, he is passionate. But even after reading the book, getting an A in lab, going to the workshop, getting an online tutor, studying, nothing prepared me for the exams. Nothing I learned translated into a good grade. It was maddening. The POGIL method is a joke, teach your students.
i recommend reading the textbook and reworking a ton of practice problems from the end of the chapter because he moves super fast. sometimes the exams require you to combine equations so you really have to understand / be able to integrate the concepts.
Entertaining lecturer, he gives a lot of extra credit in the class and sometimes curves the course. He puts up old exams to help you study and usually they're the same with different numbers or elements. I took him for the whole year of gen chem, very encouraging and answers to e-mails in a timely manner. The textbook is also helpful if you read it
It's a hit or miss with this guy. Sometimes he gives out random long-story problems on the exams that you have absolutely no idea how to do. He also asks questions about POGIL activities on the exams which is usually a wild guess for me. He often makes mistakes on the exam and you get some free points for it. Would not recommend if you hate math.
Prepare to get BLASTED on the exams because the problems are not even close to the ones he asks in class. Exams are often long and never given enough time to complete. Only way you do good in this class is to have prior knowledge of the materials or study HARD. The only savior is you get a note sheet for every exam but that rarely even helps.
He says from the get-go, he does not give you a grade, you earn it. This is college people, no one is going to hold your hand and give you a participation trophy. Work really hard and you'll do well. This is a science class to prepare you for the realities of STEM. Sheagley gives you the tools to succeed if you are willing to utilize them.
Exam questions are NOTHING like the questions he gives in class or handouts. Exams are often worded in a confusing way. Only way you do good in this class is study day and night. Teacher is cool and down-to-earth but doesn't know how to teach. Exam questions are often long worded problems that you've never seen in your life! Beware and study hard!
This class is the most boring class I've ever taken at PSU, and I think it is all due to the professor's style. He makes you purchase a $40 iClicker so he can grade you on participation, and his lecture is just him reading off of the powerpoint slides. He livens it up with a few examples though. I got an A, but you should take it at PCC instead.
Obviously knows his chemistry but expects everyone to keep up with his often ridiculous pace. Test questions do not match book problems or handouts and if you don't get help outside of class, you will likely struggle.
he knows chemistry but he does not know how to teach it. And he almost always makes mistakes when trying to teach us something new
Sheagley is humble, personable and accessible to students. He has a true desire for students to learn the material.

Teacher comments: 
If you have a choice between any professor and Andrew Flight, choose Flight. I was completely blown away. He is the best mathematics professor I have ever seen (and I've taken a lot of math classes). He explains things in a way that really help you to understand the material and is fair when it comes to grading. You won't find anyone better.
Amazing professor and explains everything very well. Notes are very clear, but if you don't attend lecture, learning the material through his notes can be sometimes difficult due to the material in this class. One issue I have with him is that he is very bad with emails and the best way to contact him is to go to his office hours or lecture.
Andy is a very animated and engaging professor! He has a deep knowledge of statistics. Considering it was an applied class he gave enough theory and background to satisfy people who like to know why it works. I HIGHLY recommend doing the "suggested" problems since the concepts appear on exams but not always on graded homework.
I failed stats with another professor. I took this professor the very next term and got an A+. The professor makes all the difference. I am literally writing this review 5 years after graduation. I still remember this class and its lessons and use them frequently. Not only does Prof. Flight make stats easy and fun, but the lessons stay with you.
Great teacher, let's you use one page of notes for both midterms and then two pages for the final. He tells you what is going to be on the midterm/final. He has old tests to help you prepare. Didn't use the textbook much, he's a funny guy. Class is super easy, if you've taken statistics before, easiest A, if you haven't, it's still easy.
Started this class pretty bad, didnt do the homework which caused me to do very bad on my midterm. After doing my homework working on other tasks and getting help when needed I got 100/100 on my final and brang my grade up by a whole letter. You just have to really do the homework and youll be good. Really good proff.

AMAZING professor &amp; one of the best I've had at PSU. His intentions are to set you up for success in his class. He is also open to suggestions. You need a study guide? Ask &amp; he'll make you one. You will not be shocked when it comes around to a test because he will EFFECTIVELY prepare you for it. There is a clear grading criteria.
Professor Flight is awesome! He really wants you to understand the concepts he is teaching! I really like the way he explains the material. It is clear that he is very familiar with all the material. He is very funny and helpful!
Andy is an amazing professor. He repeats himself often which would be my only complaint. However, he is hilarious and amazing at explanations. He also cares so much about his students it's amazing. 100% would recommend!!
I LOVE my professor Andrew Flight! He is the coolest guy I have ever seen! The lectures that he gave was very understandable and easy to follow. He cares about his students a lot, so he always moved due dates of homework for those who have not completed yet. I really want to take another class that he teaches. Thanks!
Stats 244 with Andy was, dare I say, easy. He breaks everything down, paces himself well, posts all of his notes for you, and makes all of this statistics stuff seem like a walk in the park. He tests you on the information you need to know and doesn't trouble with the nuanced details. I will honestly miss getting up for his 8am class.
Andy is a great teacher and I would definitely recommend taking his classes. I am currently in his Stats 241 class and I have done great thanks to him. He is always available to help students and gives great lectures. There is homework, projects and quizzes aside from exams, but he is very flexible about due dates. Also very quirky and fun.
Andy is an amazing professor especially for statistics which can be a difficult class. There are weekly quizzes and homework which is assigned for you to practice but not graded. He is really laid back and explains the concepts clearly, he answers any questions you have without making you feel like an idiot for asking. HIGHLY recommended.
Andrew Flight is the nicest person I have ever seen! He cares about his students  and try not to fail them.  I skipped other classes sometimes but I never skipped his class because it is super fun and helpful. Before I met him, I just memorized all. But after I met him, I became to try to understand how the formula works.  Thank you!
Very difficult to understand. The lectures and the homework did not even correspond.
Andy was amazing. He had an awesome positive attitude @ 8:15 in the morning and made you happy that you came to class. His note style was awesome and  clearly explained how to do things. If you didn't catch something you could just ask your awesome recitation teacher! Take this class with Andy! He makes it interesting rather than grueling. :)
Andy is a really nice guy, who tries very hard to make the dry logical side of math more interesting. Your graded based off of 2 tests and homework in even thirds, so make sure you are paying attention and doing the homework. As long as your mind is logic driven, this class is not difficult, but can get somewhat confusing with all the notation.
Flight is amazing! i took him after i dropped out of Webbs class. he made stats so easy to understand. math/stats have never been my strong suit but with him i ended up with a 98% in the class. if you go to lectures and pay attention you will do fine. look online for calculator stuff cause he does not always cover that in class.
He has great energy and enthusiasm for his subject, even at 8:15 AM. Embodies what a college professor should be like: understanding, witty, knowledgeable in many disciplines, fair, and well respected. Four graded homeworks, two midterms, and a final.  Attend ALL classes and recitations. Best 8:15 class at PSU.
Teacher name: Webb, Rachel
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Rachel is a great teacher, the class was pretty easy with a small workload. I got nearly 100% on both midterms and I'm sure I will do well on the final. I really enjoyed the online homework system we used (Realizeit). Her textbook was free, helpful and, easy to read, but you could get away without reading it. Optional problem sessions twice a week.
I would not take her again.
Rachel is a wonderful instructor, I've taken her for both 243/244. She does not give you a grade, you earn your grade by staying on top of the workload. She gives partial credit on tests, offers extra credit, and is always available during office hours. Highly recommend for self-starters and those that are disciplined enough to put in the effort.
I have never cried so much in my entire life, and my significant other is very upset as well. Ms. Webb is the worst "math" instructor that I have ever had. She does not provide lecture notes or videos, so be prepared to instruct yourself. Please do yourself a favor and take statistics in person if you struggle with math whatsoever.
The material is DENSE! Get ready to load up a ton of information. Also, keep in mind, this professor WILL NOT pass you if you get a failing grade on the final. It's written in her syllabus. You have to have a proctor staring at you during the midterm and final which is very uncomfortable. The class is hard, simply said. It's statistics...
Professor Webb was literally the worst instructor I think I've ever had. She was rude, dismissive and condescending to say the least. She sent out multiple emails encouraging students to drop her class because of the difficulty. Her syllabus was contradictive, as was she in her email correspondences. Her assignment load was unrealistic.
She is great!
Rachel is great. Lots of extra credit opportunities. 4 Labs that are step by step (easy A), 2 in person quizzes, homework and online quiz due every Sunday. All work is to prepare you for Final(35% of grade) and Midterm(30% of grade). She is a great professor. She cares how you do. Do the work and you will get an A. Best option for non-stats majors!
Fast pace test and homework due every sunday and everything is done online
There's a lot of work to do, but if you keep up then it's easy. The midterm and final are taken in person. You are allowed a full page of notes plus a packet that really helps. I think Rachel understands that statistics is very much about the application, not memorizing calculator short-cuts. She also offered a 5% extra credit!!
AWFUL. I really don't know why there are so many amazing reviews because I had to take stats again this term and many of my fellow students said she was just as horrible as I thought. She's rude, condescending and does NOT know how to teach an online course. AVOID HER.
Refuses to post calucator tutorial Questions are treated with little regard Makes you feel stupid Does everything to make sure you don't pass  I made it to week 8...
She is a fantastic teacher. Her lectures are clear, and well organized. I would definitely take her again!
Rachel Webb is fantastic. I took an online course so I didn't see her in person alot, but she often would send reminders about when things are due and was quick to reply to questions. The study review is  helpful and similar to her tests. You are given more than enough time to finish tests and allowed a page of notes. Great extra credit opportunity
I appreciated her giving the students plenty of extra credit opportunities throughout the term. Her grading criteria is very clear. She comes off as a straight-to-the-point person. Textbook is not needed for this class but if you like practice problems then take advantage of the free book. Help is there when you need it. Overall, not a bad class.
I despise STATS and had a terrible 243 instructor. With that said, Rachel's class was better. She has more class resources than all my instructors had this term so the help and extra work is always there. 5 Quizzes (one is dropped), 4 labs, recitation attendance required, difficult exams, and plenty of extra credit available.
Professor Webb is a  wonderful professor. Her classes are tough but if you pass you will certainly know the material. Her lectures are very comprehensible and she has a great no-nonsense style.
She's a good professor. She may not be exciting or funny, but if you pay attention &amp; care about your grade, you'll do fine. She gives clear examples, drops lowest quiz score, allows full page of notes on quizzes/exams. HW not required, but is good practice. She uploads lectures but don't skip class unless you can teach it to yourself. Free textbook
Rachel is crystal clear about what is expected. If anyone is giving her a bad review it's because they didn't show up to class or do the assigned reading and practice problems. She doesn't collect homework, she spells out the lab assignments, and she's very clear about what she expects from her students from day one. She gives tons of extra credit.
Rachel is an amazing professor, she is very clear with expectations, if you skip any lecture or recitation you run the risk of failing quickly. She is always there to help during office hours. Quizzes and tests are easy if you study and put effort in each week, she allows tons of materials to be used on quizzes and tests. Definitely recommend.
Teacher name: Bass, Joshua
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Bass is amazing, highly recommend! He does a great job of making theory interesting and easy to follow. He is funny and cares about students. In 301 &amp; 302 there are 4 small papers, midterm and a final. He hands out the essay exam questions in advance so you can prep. I hope to take more classes with Prof. Bass.
Class is not mandatory but he gives really great lectures. There is weekly work, which is pretty easy as long as you put some effort in. He gives out a study for the midterms. Pretty quick at emailing back, but not really indepth conversation. I would definitely recommend and would take him again.
I took this class online so most of our learning was from the textbook. Thankfully the reading is easy, but can be time consuming. No homework or projects, only weekly tests for each chapter read. In the midst of finals panic I somehow missed the final for this class which is required to pass, prof still let me take it with no hit to my grade.
Great professor. His lectures are fantastic, interesting, easy to digest, and informative. Definitely recommend not skipping many classes. His class is not too paper heavy. I have taken a couple lecture classes from him and is one of my absolute favorite professors at Portland State U.
Instructor Bass is an awesome teacher and is laid back and caring individual. I learned alot of information that I can take to the real world.
This teacher was one of the best sociology teachers I've had. He knows theory like no other and I enjoyed his lectures and his humor. He kept me interested in the topic. There are a few papers and essay exams -- come to class and you'll do well. A week before midterms and finals he gives out the essay questions that will be asked so you can study.
The best professor in this university by far. Brilliant, hilarious, amazing all around. People forget that you can be incredibly smart, kind, and thoughtful and still be a terrible professor. He doesn't use stupid powerpoint slides or the computer at all. He drafts the notes on the boards as he goes through class, with highly interesting lectures.
I love Professor Bass!!! He is super funny and cool. I love the way he does his lectures, as long as you take good notes you will do fine. He is kind of sarcastic but explains everything really well. I love his sociology classes.
Joshua Bass is overall one of my favorite SOC teachers. He does a really great job and really encourages people asking questions that usually leads to great class discussions. The tests were a bit difficult, but if you study they shouldn't be too hard. Would totally recommend, especially for Intro to Soc.
Josh is a great professor! His lectures are amazing, grading criteria is clear, he offers extra credit and makes sure all his students understand a concept before he moves on. He's really funny too which keeps you engaged.
He gives really clear notes that he writes out and explains as he's going. Takes the time to answer questions and put them into the discussion. The class is fun to be in and listen to and the only homework is a weekly 2 page paper on what is being discussed but it is really easy to get done. Easy class to study for, overall a very competent teacher
His an amazing teacher, love his lectures he gives examples and amazing lectures .
Honestly, the best professor I've ever had. He engages us in his lectures and is so passionate about Sociology that it gave me goosebumps the first week I was in his class. He's funny, self-critical, descriptive, and a master of his craft. The in-class notes are difficult to look back through and comprehend so make sure to read the book as well.
Dr. Bass is open to questions and flexible. We didn't get through all the material in the syllabus, but he didn't force us to cram on our own. Attend class, take notes, and read the textbook! Also, jot examples down when he talks. Tests were hard, but the tests were curved and participation points help. The writing assignments were easy if you try
Professor Bass is an amazing lecturer, he outlines the key points very clearly. He writes down the main ideas on the board which is a huge help but definitely write your own notes because you probably won't remember what he said specifically later. The way he gives the text information flows so well together but definitely go to his lectures.
Josh's lectures highlight the key points, and the textbook goes in-depth with the details. Attending class helps grasp the theories and concepts. As an instructor, he is blunt, sarcastic, and stays focused on the subject at hand. He gives out the study guide, so the essay exams are easy if you study/review.
Took this class with around 130 other people. Nice writing assignments every week. Very helpful feedback and concise teaching!
Bass was engaging and had a sense of humor. He has two kick ass essay quizzes, so get ready to read and stretch your brain. Theory is boring in nature be he keeps your attention. He says does that make sense a million times. Bring your "A" game.
This is the professor you want to take if you're interested in studying sociology. He is balanced, fair, honest, engaging; everything you want in a professor. I have learned far more in one of his classes than I've learned in all other classes not taught by him. For Sociology at PSU, do all you can to get into HIS class.
If you go to class, take notes on his lectures, and read or even skim most of the chapters you will get a good grade :)
Teacher name: Loney, Jennifer
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I felt stressed and burnt out even being in this class. Love BA 205 material but please don't take this class with Jennifer. This is a 200 level class with 400 level assignments. Lots of unnecessary and time confusing busy work, lots of tests and readings. And she finds the smallest errors to mark you down. First C ever in my life despite hard work
The class has a lot going on! Its tough but the syllabus, overviews, and study guides are all difficult to read/understand. Its an online class and she wont get back to you in a timly manner for questions. Reading is often confusing and information doesnt line up with tested material. She actually is unprofessional.
Honestly, one of the worst online courses I've ever taken. There is so much unnecessary and repetitive work. She is also a harsh grader and will grade you down for the smallest of mistakes. She also takes a very, very long time to reply to email. I had to email her three separate times before she replied to me. Would not recommend this professor.
This Professor grades you and says there is feedback when there is none. She also likes to give you the lowest grade possible. In week 3 or 4 she says it's an easy week when there are 2-3 projects to complete and 2-3 exams for the week and also the learnsmart there are 3-4 assignments in one week. She likes to leave her students in the dark.
Very harsh and gives a lot of work. Do not Recommend!!
Hardest course I have ever taken. Not because the course is complicated but because she give way too much work, most of it is unnecessary and repetitive. Tough grader and sometimes unfair. However she replies quickly to mail and is available most of the time if you have questions. I dont recommend
Not my most favorite professor. There's tons of unnecessary work in my opinion. She's very particular (nice way of saying it) in the way she grades. She'll grade you down for the smallest of things. The final exam is web-cam-proctored, closed book, no notes, no anything, and very difficult. I wouldn't want to take this professor again.
Jennifer is okay. Lectures are long because you cover a lot of information but she made them engaging by talking about real life situations and encouraging group discussions. She gives you a study guide for the midterm and final at the beginning of the term. Just study for the tests and you'll be fine
Jennifer is a good teacher, although she does have her definite favorites which I find unprofessional. Tests are difficult but doable if you get a good group for the group project you'll be fine, but she, unfortunately, chooses the groups for you.
There is a group project (including a final paper), a midterm, and a final. Besides that, there isn't much place to earn points. She grades pretty harsh on the paper, so be prepared to make sure your paper is written well and formatted correctly. The midterm and final aren't easy but you can get an A if you study. Lectures are long.
Great &amp; passionate. The tests cover everything on the study guide so if you study well you'll be fine. Don't wait until the day before to fill out the study guide, do it as you go over chapters in class. I bought the book access, but the lectures/slides covered everything you need to know for exams. Choose groups wisely.
Do not take the 4 hour night class. You will die. She is a goof teacher that provides good study guides but her tests are hard and if you don't study well you will fail.
I got an A in her class but it wasn't easy. She gives you VERY clear expectations and even tells you exactly what will be on the test. However, you have to study hard and remember a lot. MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE A GOOD GROUP! It will make ALL the difference in class. Bottom line is her class is challenging but absolutely worth taking because of her.
Jennifer is very knowledgeable in the material she teaches! Excessive homework, she expects a lot which can strain other classes if you have a family or need to work. No midterm, just one comprehensive final. She did teach valuable business writing skills. Expect A LOT of work, not an easy A!!
OK. She is a good instructor, and she expects a lot. Tests are hard if you don't study, easy if you follow the provided study guide. Not a fan of the minus next to my A for almost a 93%. After learning about motivation tactics all term this seems like quite the opposite of motivation. She loves to teach and gets very into it.
I've had Jennifer for the past couple of terms and I have loved her. She is very knowledgeable about what she is teaching. Although she is a tough grader, and expects a lot, you'll get the most out of it and gain some experience for the real world. It's not an easy A, but with hard work comes results. She is very helpful and accommodation.
Unintelligent
Jennifer is a great instructor. She is passionate about the subject, and helps students when necessary. She does class exercises, but mostly lectures. She is a tough grader. You have to work hard for the grade that you want. Exams have short AND lengthy essay questions. Will definitely take her again.
This class is a nightmare. I feel like I can never stay on top of everything I need to get done because there is just so much. It's not hard but it is extremely time consuming. The group project has zero guidance on what exactly you are doing or what she wants. Oh and to top it off lectures are incredibly boring. Take a different prof if you can.
Exceptionally unorganized.  Deliberately difficult.  Unclear content expectations.   Lectures are useless.  WARNING, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS/PROFESSOR!
Teacher name: Tierney, Gisele
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Way too much information crammed into this class! VERY homework/reading heavy- fine if it's the only class you're taking. Instructions alone are lengthy! I took it online and am wondering if maybe it's just a class that should be taken in person. Interesting material and straight forward mid-term and final (multiple choice and true/false).
I am very disappointed in PSU for this one. First off, I have taken two years worth of online classes and this was the most confusing class I've EVER taken. Be prepared for a different style of teaching. She also hasn't replied to 3 emails I sent her WEEKS ago. The material is easy, it is the setup that is annoying. Also, she uses D2L email..
Worst professor I have ever had. Doesn't respond to emails and complicated instructions. Nothing made sense. No one learned anything. Mainly online course and everyone is doing poorly. Don't bother with this professor its a guaranteed F!
Gisele gives work and homework out like her class is the only class that you take. I read and re read through pages of disorganized lecture, followed her "guidelines" and still never got better than a B. This is the first class I've taken that I have gotten less than an A. I am a Junior. Now my GPA lowered, Awful.
I have had Gisele for 4 different classes, and TA'd for her twice. Anyone who says her classes are hard isn't paying attention. There are weekly posts, there is reading... do you work and follow her instructions and you will pass. It's a comm class, if you can't follow her very basic instructions then what are you doing here?
Don't take this class. I spent at least 3 hours every night trying to figure out what the discussion question is asking. She is extremely disorganized, and you must read over the lectures (14 pages long) at least 4 times to understand them. The TA's grade your posts, so expect no more than a C or B on the discussions that took 5 hours to finish.
Prof doesn't care much about the class or students. Numerous grammatical errors in lectures and on tests (both midterm and final). Formatting of D2L page makes it hard to navigate. Formatting of lectures and readings are difficult to read. All of this makes the class hard to understand. Material doesn't seem current to topic and other COMM classes.
Her classes are confusing. I don't understand how PSU can keep for so long, someone with such little teaching skills. Her lectures are confusing and hard to follow. If you attempt to challenge her views,  you ought to be ready to become her enemy. She has weekly 500-word assignments and will mark you down if you do one more or less word. Stay away!
None of this class makes sense. If you do not have the same opinions as her, be ready for a tough time. As well, the class format is incredibly confusing- I am not sure if that is because its online, or just how she does it... but it makes it very difficult &amp; hard to follow. I would definitely not recommend taking this class online.
Wow where do I start. Don't take her for any class. The terms and vocab that she uses are unique to well, the world apparently. Words that have no meaning outside of PSU like, Throughput Variables, Groupness, Groupflow, and many more words and phrases that you will not be able to find on the web. It's all nonsense and PSU needs to look into ths
This course has some interesting info, but the lectures are so convoluted that one is unable to discern actual lessons from the writing. Weekly posts and 2 exams per term are difficult as the material covered is muddled/ TLDR. Clear structured material would go a long way to help this course.  All  around I would suggest not taking this course.
Avoid.  She doesn't teach anything.  She is rude and unavailable.  Her assignments are time consuming and not valuable.
COMM313U  This was the hardest online class I've ever taken. A workload equivalent to my three other classes this term. All of it was fluff writing. Word count  grade. Graded by TA's, no teacher contact. Unclear instructions; it's like Word had a seizure of italicize, bold, and underline. Do not take the class. Drop the class. You've been warned
Workload for this class is super heavy. Instructions are often unclear and test questions are vague &amp; hard to interpret. I spent 4 hours yesterday staring at my computer just trying to decide how to start my discussion post. This week alone was 65 pgs of reading, min. 900 words discussion (no responses this week, thankfully), +long, hard quiz.
crazy long discussion posts due every week (twice a week). Wouldn't suggest this course at all, she doesn't even grade your work she has a teaching assistant due all her work. Never even communicated with our class.
This class is ridiculous. Way too much work for an online class, her lecture are a jumbled mess, and her directions are the opposite of cohesive. SO much reading. You have to write like 800 words in discussion posts two times a week, weekly quizzes, but thankfully the tests are easy. Boring and feels like busy work.
She is one of the worst teachers i have ever taken. Her classes are just her talking the entire time. And a total waste of time.
Comm 337 was the hardest online class I have ever taken. The weekly posts (2 posts a week) are time consuming, difficult to write for her specific specifications, and pointless. She marks you down if you say your opinion in posts and her lectures and mini lectures are pages long with only paragraphs where she just runs on. Don't take this class.
I don't normally write these, but, I am taking both COMM and gender and COMM and groups with Gisel, both online. And I feel like I am being torchured. This is the worst online class I've ever taken. The information is not organized, she does not return emails until it is too late. There is a huge amount of fluff writing. NOT A GOOD PROOF OR CLASS.
I'm taking an online class with her, and I'm just over it really. She assigns novels to read when she could much easily compact the things we need to know into bullet points, she grades tough, and assigns long ass writing assignments that take up more time than my four other classes. She expects you to meet a ridiculous word count without fluff.
Teacher name: Boghossian, Peter
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
the first professor I have ever just gone to his office hours just to sit and chat. amazing prof. interesting person, and not a radical leftist. I cannot be anymore excited that I found him even though his classes are not a part of my major I will take all the classes with him I can.
If you're a radical leftist, it is vital to take a class with this professor. He will teach you how to dissect your own beliefs and determine if they're true. He is a bit intense and offensive at times, but not to the point where it's emotionally damaging - it's a cathartic offensiveness that will help you question your grasp on "reality." Vital.
His lectures bore me to death. He's always going on rants and goes off topic frequently. He doesn't provide a lot of opportunities for a balanced grade. You can't mess up in this class or you'll get a bad grade. Thankfully, I've paid attention and done well on exams. He sometimes has guest lecturers when he's off in LA to be on the radio. Annoying.
Peter is incredible at breaking down complex graduate level concepts and explaining them in a way that anyone could understand. His tests reflect what is learned in class and what is learned in class is helpful in understanding how to think critically and filter the fallacies out of your life.
Peter is one of the best professors I've had at PSU. His lectures are incredibly engaging. Attendance is taken, so it affects your grade if you skip class, but his lectures are awesome. Grade is based on 2 exams and attendance. His tests are pretty straightforward, typically a couple essay questions and multiple choice. Extra credit is offered.
I truly respect this professor and he is among the few at PSU who cares. Boghossian is transparent, honest, and is down to earth with his students. Unlike 98 percent of those who teach philosophy at PSU, he wants you to question authority. Because of this, I cannot reccomend him enough.
BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! He is astoundingly transparent and and honest with all of the knowledge he shares. He teaches with his heart and with his head and I would take every course he offers if I could.
Peter was very knowledgeable and into this subject. As I did learn I would say of you don't go to class you wont learn. His midterm and final does not come solely from the readings and videos. He could say something in class and it be on the exam. Id take him again but only if I had a light load.
Great class, great lectures, and great discussions. One of the best professors at PSU-- take his courses while you can!
There's a reason why when a class of over 50 people could skip but most of them still show up to class. His lectures are truly inspiring and thought-provoking, his ideas will entertain you and lead you to focus attentively without having to force yourself to "stay awake". He CT class will make you open up your mind and challenge your own beliefs.
Hands down one of the best class you can take at PSU. He's also one of the most genuine, inspiring, and knowledge enriched professor that I've had. His Critical Thinking class will make you challenge your beliefs, become aware logical fallacies around you, and will change your mind about how you think of the modern society. DEF would take again.
Hes a really good teacher. He really makes you open up your beliefs and tells you why he thinks what he thinks. tests are straightforward. You can only email his T.A. which I find is annoying. His lectures are amazing I wish he could talk to the whole world about his ideas. You should definitely take his class! you wont regret it. Only 2 tests.
Great lectures. A bit tangential, but really interesting, and he always tries to come back to his point. Very open for student questions (a little too open sometimes). Doesn't answer email or his office phone. If you want to talk to him instead of TA, go to office hours. Very well read. Sensitive subject matter. Expect to have values challenged.
Come to any of his classes to hear thought provoking lectures and amazing guest speakers- even the general class discussions that arise organically are wonderful; he is fair, respectful, and gives everyone a voice.
It's an ethics class and he's not afraid to speak about the truth surrounding ethics and that's what most professors lack nowadays. The point is to educate the students and he does that. It's an easy class that will make you think and he'll challenge your beliefs. Although I wish he could be more consistent in his beliefs.
I wish I could take all of Boghossian's classes. Atheism was great: informative and entertaining lectures and videos, only mid-term and final (no homework!), inexpensive text book (that he wrote) that fully complemented the class. The time flew by every class. As he says, the whole class is a 'trigger warning'. I highly recommend this professor.
This guy is fantastic. His lectures are beyond interesting, thought-provoking, and intelligent. He brings up controversial subjects and encourages people to think critically about them, so easily triggered students stay clear. There's no homework. Just attendance and tests. If you just show up and don't take notes, you could easily get a B.
Not much to say about this instructor, he's simply amazing. 2 tests that were somewhat easy. Its what I learned from this class that is amazing. Very good speaker, great insight and he lets students discuss things in class that are relevant with relevant answers. HIGHLY recommend this instructor. Listen to the knowledge bombs he drops.
Amazing lecturer, he opened with magic tricks and it was a great hook. Difficult subject to wrap your head around so read and watch everything, it's pretty entertaining stuff. Come with an open mind and don't be afraid to ask questions, it is a difficult subject to put into your own words on exams. All his stuff is in Dropbox online and Youtube.
The business ethics final was in essay format about 13 pages long. If you are great at bsing and can write in length then you will breeze through this class. Also make sure to attend every class.
Teacher name: Eichelberger, Brenda
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I enjoyed Brenda's class much more than I expected to! She's one of the most engaged professors I've ever had for an online class. While the concepts were a bit elementary, I still found myself learning A LOT in this class that can be applied to real life. The homework can be time consuming, but it was also fun and interesting so not too bad.
Brenda was amazing!! I took her for BA385 business environment and learned so much! She is passionate and truly cares about her students. I would highly recommend taking a class with her!
Brenda is a fantastic professor and really cares about her students. Class is mainly midterm(20%), final(20%), daily quizzes(36%), 4 cases(hw: 20%) discussions( 4%) Need to show up each class for the quizzes, but very easy class. Gives extra credit chances, and goes above and beyond to help you in class, and life. Take her!!
Brenda is a great professor. Need to show up for daily quizzes which are 36% of grade but easy. Midterm and final are both 20% of grade, 4 cases 20% also, discussions are 4%. She really knows her material and its all relevant. My only negative is she is very liberal, pushes agenda a little far for me. But if you show up and try, its an easy class
Brenda is not a good college professor. Her teaching style would be better fit for freshman in HIGH SCHOOL. She gives daily quizzes and you get a point for writing your name. She spends the entire class preaching her personal opinions and spends little to no time on the slides. GOOD LUCK taking notes. If you don't follow directions you fail
On the final the hand written case MUST conform to her word count specifications. She spends 90% of class lectures about her personal opinions in 10% teaching. Extra credit may not be fully available to everyone or possible for those with busy schedules. Refuses to adjust teaching if students are confused. Office hours limited and inconvenient.
Meant for Freshman students. She makes you complete assignments according to her standards for full credit which is not helpful at all. You re-write your entire resume to fit her template, and MUST come up with like 12 financial goals (even if they absolutely do not apply to you or you don't have that many) to get full credit.
As a finance major, the course felt very elementary in my opinion. I felt like the instructor wasn't as personable as she could have been. Everything was generalized towards a naive student audience. If you're a more mature adult returning back to school and already have credit cards and know about interest and stuff, this class will be a breeze.
Brenda is a solid teacher. Cares about what she teaches, has a huge emphasis on class participation, and allows us to discuss controversial topics in current events that are unethical.
Course covers old cases and I don't see that she has experience in presenting real cases. The professor doesn't know about foreign businesses when she brings examples. Be ready for taking quizzes, tough grader, and reading other materials.
Clear agenda for course. Read the textbook and prep for weekly quizzes. Participate in class. 3 cases, one MT, one final. Great lectures. Cares for students so much. If you are stuck as her for help and she will happily help. Learned so much. Great class.
Brenda is hands down the best instructor I have ever had. Class structure is very clear and you must attend and engage in lectures to do well. She understands how to tie concepts from material to every area of real life and truly wants to see her students succeed. She'll go the extra mile with you. You will invest in your future with this class.
She lacks respect for students and treats you like a 5 year old. Her instructions do not match between d2l, the assignment itself or a rubric so it's a wild guess. She speeds through lectures and then gives you a quiz at the end like you retained anything she said in the last five minutes. So read the 30pg chapters every day and you might be okay.
An Ok teacher, but a little condescending. Seems to think that her students are freshmen and treats everyone that way.
People are very divided on Brenda, but I adored her teaching. She is an amazing person with so much experience to share. If you are a good student and put in effort, you will be recognized and rewarded for it. There is a lot of work, BUT it is designed with a purpose in mind. Trust in Brenda, she knows what she's doing!
Brenda is an amazing and a caring professor. The debates and cases is my favorite part of the class. If you attend all her classes, engage in class, and follow her guidelines, you will do well.
Homework must be handed in in-person, not through email - if turned in after class starts, there will be a point deducted; following break it will not be accepted. Team case debate didn't have 100% clear instructions and she adds rules after the fact. You spend more time watching debates over cases than learning the material that you get tested on.
I really enjoyed this class. It seemed to be one of the more useful business core classes. I really liked Brenda, she had the class very well organized and I would love if other classes I still have to take would be offered by her.
The key facters I like, is she was very clear on what she wanted. What she wanted ,is you to see all sides of a issue and to understand the issue from all sides not just one side!  She help you  be a better person and stakeholder! I would say for 385 class she  hit mark and goes past it!!!
Brenda is one of my least favorite professors at PSU. She is unorganized and unclear. Grading is harsh and assignments aren't fully described. At the beginning of the term she said she welcomes questions and clarity, however when a student asks a question she is disrespectful and makes other people answer it. I don't recommend her.
Teacher name: Degrauw, Ed
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
My favorite professor at Portland State.
He's hot. I bet every girl secretly has/had a crush on him. The man with the brain��
Ed is an amazing teacher who cares about his students success. His tests are hard! But I felt like they me to keep pushing myself to really understand the material. Everything you need to know is what he says and whats on the slides. I stopped reading the book after the first exam. I just started re-watching and transcribing his lectures.
Ed was a good teacher. Hes kinda out there but he goes over everything in class that you need for the exams and he will prepare you for whatever program youre going in to. His tests werent easy but I definitely wouldnt say theyre the hardest tests ever like many people have said. I did change this class to P/NP because it was difficult.
I took the summer Human A&amp;P course and completely loved Ed. Although his exams were difficult, I did not find them barbaric. I really appreciated that he asked questions to the class/students and utilized multiple learning styles throughout each lecture. He says everything on the exam is based off of lecture but I would recommend reading the text.
Ed is a really nice guy.  His lecture style is engaging and informative but he writes the most detailed, difficult exams I've ever experienced.  If you're a detail person who doesn't mind reading, you'll do fine.  If you're a big-picture thinker, or if you can't remember what you read, expect this to be the hardest class you ever take.
I took summer herpetology with Ed and it was amazing. I recommend everyone take this 6 credit summer course if you can. There's also a summer field trip you can participate in if you want. Sometimes he's a little inappropriate but overall he's a legend and the best professor I've ever had! Wish PSU had him for more classes.
This guy is the Herpetology master! He is passionate about biology and herpetology and that carries over to the subject matter.  He does go on tangents, but they are still relevant and contribute to the peripheral knowledge needed to be a truly analytical scientist of any kind.
I love Ed! Come to class and take notes on all recorded lectures with slides as well. Rarely used textbook. I love how Ed always gives an explanation for why processes work. For example, instead of passing a statement "women bloat during menstrual cycle," he'll also explain WHY. Respect:) Aced the whole year, highly recommend!
He  is very knowledgeable and great for auditory learners. As a visual learner, I often struggled to fully process topics he was explaining in class. His lectures and powerpoints usually cover "everything" on the test, but this course takes a lot of outside effort (his video lectures, online videos, flashcards/diagrams). He is considered a bio god.
I understand why Ed has a cult following, he's hilarious, however, being dynamic and entertaining does not translate into being effective. He often goes on rants which take away from the actual lecture. 3 exams per term, heavy curve. Not my style of teaching, but I am sure works out  for most. Bummed I stuck around for all 3 terms, honestly.
You do not need the book he records and posts all lectures. Never thought I would be able to learn for lecture recordingsbut seriously only lectures from what is said in class. Study by listening to lectures while looking at slides and passed with an A. He curves his exams. His lectures are interesting and engaging.
I have taken many science courses prior to anatomy, so that helped tremendously to have that background. For the first exam, I tried reading the textbook and doing notecards but found that to be unhelpful. Go to lecture, as well as listen and take notes on all recorded lecture he send outs. Barely used the textbook after 2nd exam.
His tests and lectures and tests are geared towards pre-med students, and students who have nothing else to do but study. Material is presented very quickly, and he often goes on meaningless tangents that have nothing to do with what will be on the tests. His study guides are vague, if you are not a confident test taker then do not take his class.
Best teacher I've ever had, hands down no question; also the hardest class I've ever taken. Deeply cares for students who give their best. The immense knowledge he has taught me will stay with me forever, and I know what he's taught me will save lives one day.  More knowledgeable than any teacher I've encountered at OHSU; smartest person I've met.
Ed is a great teacher, he really wants students to learn and understand the material. i had him for 301 and 303 but had to take Hancock for 302 (i preferred Ed). Don't get the book, just study using the  recorded lectures.
Ed is hands down the best professor I've had. His tests are difficult, but they challenge you. His curve is beyond generous. Great for anyone who will be taking the MCAT, DAT, OAT etc. Goes out of his way to help students and provide mentorship. He will put you on the spot during lecture. I wish he utilized D2L for grades.
Not an easy class at all. However, lectures are actually engaging and everything from his tests are straight out of lecture or his powerpoint slides. Very brutal exams but generous curves for all three of them (he will throw out the outliers) Funny guy, highly recommend!
Lectures are interesting, but get ready to study, study, study. His testing is out of this world, felt like I knew good amount going in to test and would leave feeling like it was so so hard and I didn't know that much after all. Read the lecture chapter before lectures and study and ASK questions. He's very helpful.
Ed is not hilarious, he tries to be funny but it is very annoying. He constantly picks on students in class and sometimes he can be very inappropriate. He is distracting to take lecture with because he rocks back and forth  and also constantly makes an annoying grunting sound to clear his throat.  Would not take again. Very annoying to listen to.
Teacher name: Arante, Jacqueline
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Jacqueline was one of the best professors I had at PSU. Her grading was fair, expectation were clear and I became a much better writer after taking this class. She doesn't have page limit on papers and just lets you write as much or as little as you choose as long as your ideas are expressed.
Yes, she's tough, but it's not unreasonable to expect adult-level writing from college students. (Didn't you learn the basics in high school?) Those who expect to be coddled will be disappointed. If you're ready for a challenge that will help you improve your writing and expand your mind, she's one of the best teachers you could have. Go for it.
She's definitely doing everything she can to make students write better, but you have to get passed her strong opinions. She scares some students out of taking a class with her as the professor and she knows it. The grading is vague and often harsh (but fair). Learn and show you're making progress. She gives better grades to the students she likes.
tough but worth it
The best professor I've had at PSU. If you're not serious about getting better, of course you'll complain. She's a very strong woman and I also think that, unfortunately, throws people off. Not only did my writing improve dramatically, but I was rejuvenated after her trial by fire. Take her class if you can, and emerge tempered from the crucible.
She is difficult but extremely knowledgeable. She tries to chase away those who want an easy grade, in the first week or so more than a third of the class quit. She is a hard grader but not terrible. It was worth it to get to know her and I took another class from her the following semester. She even helped me write my MSW essay.
I have taken two classes with her. She is tough but wants her students to learn and be challenged. Her deadlines are pretty lax as long as you talk to her. She would rather have good writing then on time writing. She is one of my favorites at PSU.
All the whiners on here complain because this is the first teacher who didn't let them breeze by without a flinch. The reading is difficult &amp; volumous, but deadlines are lax. All students are encouraged to speak, but only  five to ten of us do. The silent, you're probably the ones who troll &amp; lash out here. Guess what? You're not ENTITLED.
As a non-traditional student I was surprised to find this type of of professor still teaching. She is rude and often violated the FERPA rules. This sort of behavior might fly in a high school filled with troubled students, but it has no place in a contemporary university.
She teaches class her way, so be prepared to listen to every word she says, and sort it out yourself. In other words, be an adult about it. She did improve my writing; now it's up to me to apply it. She seems to appreciate the older students in the class. The younger the student, the higher the offense taken to her style.
She is terrible, mean, abrasive, unclear, interrupt's before you can even make a point making you feel dumb. Do not take this class. She thinks only her personal stories count.
This prof. Is very frustrating. She spends too much time preaching her political and religious opinions. She had some interesting ideas about Shakespeare but because of her teaching style and her overbearing opinions, I dread going to this class. She is often kind of mean and puts students down so it is hard to contribute to the discussion. Avoid!
She can be funny, but her humor can also be offensive and distracting. I think this might have had something to do with students being hesitant to participate in discussion. The textbook was just awful, and her grading standards are utterly vague, leading me to believe that she might base her grading on how much she likes students. Avoid!
Beware this professor if you are religious and especially if you are Catholic!  She turns EVERY lecture into a left-est rant or just a rant against Catholics.  Also If you are a student who values clarity also beware her, she is extremely vague when telling her students what to expect on tests and assignments.
I greatly appreciated her class. I was challenging of course, but she forced me to approach writing in an academic level that truly set me up for success at the end of the day. She doesn't try to screw around, but she does have a witty sense of humor. I was very pleased with my accomplishments in the end.
This professor needs to go back to highschool, she has clearly does not understand how college classrooms are supposed to run.  She's arrogant, full of herself, and doesn't know the subject that well.
expects too much in too little time, w/poor coverage of all. unless you dazzle her with brilliance, best to stick to a format (she has lists of do's and don'ts, including no-no words) and just follow it &amp; muddle through. admitted she kept no track of our grades. syllabus is useless to determine what's next, leaving students lost &amp; unfocused.
I've had several classes with this professor. However, she is one of the worst teachers you could pick. She is full of herself, her opinions, and not above putting students down on personal levels in front of class. I would recommend NEVER taking a class from her, unless you can handle not being allowed to learn with your own opinions.
Very full of herself. You hardly know what the content of the class is because it is covered my her opinion. To make thinks worse she gets unprofessionally angry when someone tries to respond to her opinion. She also flat out told the class that she is only prepared for class every other day. She also doesn't follow the syllabus.
I really did not find her that bad. She seems to like talking about herself but most of the anecdotes are enjoyable though not always relevant. I found the intro to fiction class very easy though I know others didn't do as well. She sets you up to get an A by explaining the concepts for you. What's nice is she wants you to think for yourself.
Teacher name: Lockwood, Richard
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Prof. Lockwood seems like an okay professor during the first few weeks. He turns into a conceited, biased, unavailable professor by the halfway point of the term. Thought I was doing okay through the whole course but ended up failing. Ridiculously hard grader, but his critiques arent rational. Rather, he seems to grade based on his mood.
Dr. Lockwood is entertaining, engaging and knowledgable. He has wonderful stories about reading brain wave patterns too! Great format, great lectures and fun to participate in. Projects and testing is reasonable and fairly graded. His expectations are clear and so is his grading. Fantastic professor!
Lockwood can seem like you are about to have a good class at the beginning. Then as the weeks go on his egocentric attitude will make you borderline insane. He makes a film and health class very difficult and admits it. If you want a super hard cluster class, with a guy who is in complete love with who he is, take it. If not, look elsewhere.
He is conceited and makes a fuss over small details. He does this thing where it takes him a while to finish a though which gets annoying over time. He makes a "film" class WAY too serious. For the love of God were watching films.
I really enjoyed Dr. Lockwood's class. He's funny, smart and engaging. The screenplay project ends up being pretty cool because it's different than your usual report style essay in other classes. A lot of the class participated in discussions and the movies are great. Expectations are clear when it comes to assignments.
Really great instructor overall. He is a tough grader, so don't expect the class to be easy. Apply yourself and he will recognize you. Group project at end of term isn't too bad, but be warned, he will drill your group when you present.
A sociologist professor who studies health care; this was the greatest gift PSU gave to my education. This class is designed to prepare you for graduate school. Get ready to work hard and read the textbook cover to cover several times. Sit in the front! Email him! Utilize him as a resource and as a mentor.
Easiest Lockwood class of the three. Watch a movie every week, write 2 pages on it. It gets easier as you go.  He sneaks questions onto the midterm/final from the book and slides that most people don't expect.  Screenplay group project in second half of the term - write an episode of a tv show with a health spin.  Sounds way harder than it is.
Professor Lockwood has a good sense of humor and is clear on his assignments. Class never got out late and it even got out early sometimes if the movie was short. I would definitely take this professor again, he makes class fun and enjoyable.
Has no empathy. Only gives you good grades if he likes you. I disagreed with a grade he gave me and since then he gave me low grades. Not professional. He is passionate about his teaching, but he is a researcher.. not a teacher and does not understand how students learn best. I got straight A's  in PHE classes until now...
Super intriguing, big and broad concepts that Lockwood will make your work for.  He is clearly very passionate, which makes the seemingly boring context quite interesting.
Lockwood managed to make a class mostly about health insurance interesting. Best teacher, huge nerd. Midterm and Final are both essays but are mostly taken from the homework. He doesn't talk about the book much but likes to sneak in a question from in into tests. It's not difficult if you put in the work.  Take him!
Amazing professor, very helpful when I went to his office hours and his lectures were very engaging. He loves discussion and when you have something to say he really makes you feel acknowledged. End of the term group presentation on a country requires a lot of effort and understanding of the subject.
DR. Lockwood is  great.
Professor Lockwood is awesome, he really makes you work for it, if you don't know what you're talking about you're not going to get an A.  He has a unique way of being able to detect BS essay responses and is an unforgiving grader.  Anyone who complains about him simply didn't put the time and effort into his class.  Its not easy but it's worth it!
Film and Health: loved it. Most movies were good. Weekly response papers mean a lot of writing. He's a tough grader (follow all directions!), but he's a great professor. His lectures are interesting, engaging, and often funny. I'm taking him for Health Systems, and I don't regret it. In-class, handwritten essays are his 'thing'. Easy on the eyes
Go to class, take good notes and you will do just fine. Attendance is mandatory and he does not post his lecture notes online. His exams are essay format. However they're not too bad because you don't have to answer every essay. He gives you a variety of questions so you can answer the one you studied best.
Captivating professor but your grade is subject to his mood and preconceived notions about you. He''s given full credit when I was wrong and less than half when I quoted lecture with supporting statements. I found it disconcerting that he asked me to coffee to nerd out after class. Lacks professionalism. ''A'' grades in PHE until this course.
He knows everything about the subject, but he grades with no empathy. Two test, essay style, you get 7 questions, you get to choose 5 from them, all page essay answers, the more you write, the more you get points. 5 homework during the term..
Fantastic professor. He is extremely knowledgeable  and really knows his stuff.I feel like I learned more from him than anyone else. Just make sure to attend class and take good notes, as he does not post his lectures online.
Teacher name: Holdt, Carol
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
While there are 1-2 chapters of reading from the online textbook each week, the content is easy to comprehend and follow. The quizzes are based on the reading, and the questions can be tough if you haven't read the chapter.
The way she grades is ridiculous. The average score of our midterm was a C-, and she didn't question why we didn't do well on an OPEN BOOK midterm for an online class, she just said she'd "like to see scores higher."
NEVER TAKE A CLASS WITH HER.... she is the worst. Extremely rude whenever you email about specifics. Treats an Intro level class like its a 400 level. Her grading is horrible. I was thinking about minoring is SOC but she easily made me hate the topic (which sucks) and she really ruined my excitement for anything soc related. worst, teacher ever...
I wish someone would have warned about the academic cliff I was about to jump off of. Like any a decent human being who cares about humanity, here's my chance to warn you. 1. You're on your own. 2. Lots of homework 3. Lots of reading The professor doesn't really provide good feedback, so get ready to learn it all your self.
Well, the only thing I can really say is YOUR ON YOUR OWN literally. Really stick to deadlines, and remember you had a chance to change your fate, but you didn't. Good luck, you're going to need a whole lot of it.
Easily the worst prof I've had at PSU. The syllabus is super vague and the grading policy doesn't make sense. The prof is also not understanding at all- so good luck if you have a dispute over grades or an assignment bc she'll just immediately shut you down. Overall, just the worst. Do not take this class.
Mostly reading and quizzes/tests supplemented by weekly participation scores for discussion board posts. Expectations clearly expressed in syllabus. Instructor was available by email and prompt to reply. Relies heavily on test bank questions for exams. I successfully disputed answers on 2 occasions and the instructor was receptive to feedback.
Strangely nit-picky when it comes to grading your writing. Is mysteriously focused on students not plagiarizing. Many test questions are worded in such a way that you must analyze the way things are phrased in order to answer correctly. Some test questions seem like trick questions. Would not take this prof again, even tho I rec'd a decent grade.
Good luck with getting a grade back!! I calculated my grade and was supposed to get an A in her class but she said she curved my Exams grades therefore I got at B+ in her class. Since when do curves made to lower your grade. Also when I tried to speak to her about it, she was very rude!
Clearly, this professor does not want her students to succeed. She has a history of accusing students of plagiarism and directly reports them to the dean for "fun." Her questions are not clear and this class is not even worth it. PLEASE AVOID
Very poor explanation on grading and calculation too difficult to follow. Grades are not given back timely, 3 weeks for our first assignment grade, AND has TWO TAs that do all of grading. The feed back is very nit picky, need to go beyond her instructions to get full credit. Does not want her students to succeed. Terrible professor!!! DO NOT TAKE!
This teacher says, if you follow the instructions and do what is expected you will be doing C work. If you want a higher grade you have to go above and beyond. This is stupid, if I understood the subject expertly I wouldn't need the class. You have no clues what to do to get a good grade out of this class. I am a 4.0 student, I have no idea
I am an A student and I cannot for the life of me get a good grade in this class. Somehow, every post/quiz I do, there is always something that she marks wrong. Quizzes are very confusing, and she gives no feedback. I would not recommend taking this class with her.
This teacher doesn't care about their students. She accused half of my class of plagiarism and made us all go through the Dean of Student Life to deal with it. Every email response I received was mean and she never seemed like she cared. She also only has her TA's grade everything and you can almost never receive an A.
Be prepared to work hard for little reward.
Professor seemed fine and responsive to questions.  Quizzes were difficult considering there was very little lecture material given, solely based on the reading and questions were tricky and took time to find the right answer.  Many questions were multiple-multiple choice which made quizzes hard, and grade was almost entirely weekly quizzes.
This was honestly the worst class I have EVER taken. I do not like the prof. I am a pretty good student and have taken many online classes. I have gotten good grades in all of them except this one. I have had to take this class twice! The first time I took this class I was shocked at how little she cared, she has her TAs do all the grading.
Dont take this class! She doesn't care if students succeed. Changes grading requirements as the weeks go along.
Even if students follow along with assigned instructors they are knit picked for something else not in the grading criteria. Small chances to succeed. Terrible feedback on assignments. The class averages currrently are 40% and lower..... this is probably a problem.
She is a tough grader but if you read the syllabus and pay attention you will pass no problem.

Teacher comments: 
Grades on an extreme curve so its not hard to do well. Still, his method of testing is incredibly confusing. You have to figure out which questions have multiple answers, as theres never a Both A and B are correct option. Doesnt seem to care that his handwriting is illegible and his markers are out of ink. Overall an unnecessary headache.
You'll get a short (2-3 questions) quiz every class, covering previous materials and these quizzes are very helpful to study for midterms and final exam. Professor's handwriting is atrocious and it may be hard to understand new concepts without being able to read what he writes on the board. However, he can answer your question promptly on Slack.
Great teacher. Clear with everything. Exams are easy.
Wouldn't take for any intro course with. Speaks with lots of jargon and lecture slides are like refrigerator poetry and not very explanatory, Math problems not practiced or taught in class, but are assigned for homework. Would be better to take with more knowledge in subject area. Nice funny guy, just not the best professor in my opinion.
Smart guy - not a very good teacher. His 'teaching' style is having confusing information on some slides talking about it for a couple minutes, showing the answer, no explanation on how he got there, and then some long story about he was on a board of some sort and how he is the smartest. I wish I would have checked RMP before taking this class.
Attendance is mandatory for the many pop quizzes. Professor Woods is very knowledgeable of the subject but caters to engineering students, as this is a economic engineering course. I would not recommend taking his class if you are an economics major.
I was one of the few econ majors in a sea of engineers so maybe I was just more familiar with the material, but I didn't find this course too difficult. I enjoyed Jamie's lectures and examples he would use from his life to illustrate concepts. If you don't know anything about accounting or finance, get familiar with it beforehand.
Checks attendance by giving random pop quizzes in class. He is a very great professor, knows what he's teaching, and has interesting lectures. He does not grade on a traditional scale, but gives grade based on class standing. The content is a lot of math and accounting, tests average 50% because it is hard material but he teaches well.
Avoids answering students questions, structures the class so the majority of the students fail. The quizzes online wont help you with the exams in class.
Jamie is a great lecturer and he prefaces the class by saying that it is "like drinking from a fire hose" and he is right. There is a tremendous quantity of subject matter to master and you must be overly attentive to survive. Overall it just seems like it is must more difficult that a university studies (no prereq.) course should be.
Tough grader, hands not held but resources are available for you to be successful.  This class simplifies problems for the purpose of the engineering exams. Lectures are fast but he's an expert.
Professor Woods makes you study a lot. Since this class covers lots of materials,  preview well and use his class to review materials. If you study online quizzes and sample exams multiple times, you will do fine for exam.
I'm not sure why this class is part of a university studies cluster.  Woods said "none of these techniques are useful outside of the PE exam", which was basically a middle finger to those students not on an engineering track.  A a finance major, other classes use much easier techniques for similar stuff.  Stay away if not an engineer. Awful class.
Best teacher at PSU. Very engaging and really prepares you for the final. The grading system is very different then what you'll be used to as you basically compete against your classmates but it'll make you work hard. Very funny and super energetic guy. I would take his class again
As a finance major, I can tell you that the material you learn from this class encompasses all the intro level accounting and finance courses (BA211, 303, and some from FIN 319 and ACTG 381). That being said, it would normally take a BA student 2 full terms to learn the same material and this class (a university study class, ironically) covers all
Dr. Woods is a smart economist. That being said, he's a terrible teacher. His lectures are all over the place and if you ask him questions he consistently dodges them or flat out refuses to answer them. His quizzes are a nightmare, almost like he's trying to make you fail. Test averages for the class float around 50%. Worst class I've taken.
You have no other choice but him for EC 314U.  All the comments below are legit. Unfortunately for engineers you have no choice but deal with him.
A large class with assignments and quizzes online. The lectures were not clear.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS WASTE OF MONEY AND WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING.
DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. 1. The course is poorly organized - he created his own wiki that is confusing and outdated. 2. Quizzes are difficult - lots of trick questions, worth 80% of your grade. 3. Limited feedback - on one quiz the class average was 25%, so he accused students of cheating, and then refused to provide help on the difficult topic.
Teacher name: Blazak, Randy
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is an amazing teacher and comes highly recommended.
Mr. blazak is the man talk about so much knowledge a mountain full and its difficult to get to the top but that's a good thing. the man has done alot for this world he will open your eyes even more.
I loved Randy! He made the lectures interesting, funny, and easy to understand. We had to do quite a bit of reading because he said we would discuss it in class, but he tends to get sidetracked with some of his stories and we didn't really end up discussing the readings. All in all, he has a great teaching style and I would 100% take him again.
Randy is a great guy. He's really professional but feels like you are cracking a cold one with the boys in a Friday morning. Truly adds great value to your life and changes your ways of thinking about issues.
Professor Blazak is very inspirational, very knowledgeable on the subject., and very involved in sociological issues outside the classroom. I really enjoyed his lectures, definitely learned to see things with a new perceptive. Offers opportunity for extra credit, and also emails sample questions that you might see on quiz's or tests.
I took a 1 credit Pass/No Pass class with him. He doesn't post his slides and the final was way too extensive for a class that isn't even graded. Not to mention I'm sure 30 mins of the lecture could have been cut out if he didn't go off on tangents every 10 minutes.
I only took a two-week P/NP course with Randy which was one weekend lecture, some reading, and an exam, so I don't know what a graded full-term class would look like with him, but I fully enjoyed his lectures. I appreciated his passion, candor, and how he was able to be real while at the same time maintaining objectivity and "giving the facts".
I have taken 3 SAPP classes with Randy at the University of Oregon, and he has got to be one of my favorite professors to take a class with. He made five hour lectures fly by. He is so knowledgeable and inspired me to learn about criminology. Seriously changed my perspective on a lot of things in the world. Great teacher, definitely recommend.
One of the best professors at PSU. You will have to work hard but you will want to and you will walk away actually absorbing a lot of quality information and sociological understanding. This was my favorite class of all time even with a 30 page paper.
I took SOC Hate Crimes with Randy, and I actually looked forward to going to class in the morning. The class was really tough, though. But, he was very energetic and funny, and constantly kept everyone's attention. He's an expert in the field and gives his students a lot of important information. I wish more professors were as knowledgable as him!
I love this class so much! I wish he would teach all of my teachers!
Where do I start?!  The guy is awesome!  Took 2 classes and would take more if my schedule allowed.  Only issue I found was that he does grade a little tough.  Other than that, he is very funny and very knowledgeable.  I loved his classes!
If you do all the readings and study his review sheet for exams and quizzes you will be fine. He offered some extra credit. But if you are religous don't take this class he is always mocking and offending religous views. Especially christianity. It's disrespectful.
Prof Blazak has a different method to his teaching than most professors do. He does swear quite a bit in class while giving his lecture. He does beat to his own drum so be prepared. There's a lot of work to do. If you do the work, you should be fine. If you need help, he does provide it for you. I'm not sure I would take him again. Not my fav prof.
I liked Randy's style of teaching and although it is a challenging class, if you do the work you will do fine.
He is a very fun professor! He's engaging, funny and overall very helpful if you speak up. This class is A LOT of work, with new assignments almost every class. However, I'm so glad that I took the class because I feel better prepared for grad school. Show up, take good notes, and don't procrastinate on your project and you'll do well.
Dr. Blazak has a solid command of sociological theory and, despite a relatively informal demeanor as a lecturer, has relatively difficult requirements for a top grade. I assume some of the other students putting up questionable reviews might have performed poorly in this regard. For anyone truly interested in theory, he is among the best.
Prof Blazak is fantastic at provoking well rounded thought processes. Everyone should have get to take a class from Blazak. He is very helpful and sincere in his passion to bring knowledge to so many of us. The guys in the back row loved Blazak this term!!!
This is a great class and a perfect reflection as to why online classes are not good always and that you need the professor interaction. He is an amazing teacher and I highly recommend him to anyone. Would definitely take another one of his classes!!
This class is why online educiation is the next big thing. Randy"likes to do things old school," while proving daily whilst talking about himself that he is a narcissists and a hypocrite, constantly contradicting his self-proclaimed feminism with off the cuff sexual humor and innuendos + Randy loves the giggling girls in the front row-Dont ya,Randy
Teacher name: Wallek, Ben
School name: Portland State University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I'd like to respond to the one negative review someone posted about this instructor. Ben does give credit if you attempted the homework but he reviews it in depth the following class so that everybody understands it. He is always available to give feedback on problems when asked. Your effort in this class will determine your grade as with any class
during the entirety of the term Ben gave credit for homework but did not actually review it. i could have just drawn a stickfigure for each problem and i probably would have still received full credit. which i regret not doing. to put it simply you will not learn as much and will be far less prepared for future courses if you choose this teacher.
a great teacher
Ben was an amazing teacher and I really did enjoy his class. Ben taught at a good pace for everybody to understand what was happening. As long as you turn something in for the homework you will get full credit. Ben also assigns test-prep problems and if you do them you should have no problem on the test. He is very clear about what he wants
He is helpful, respectful, kind, cares about his students understanding. The most part I liked about him is that he gives you what is expected in all his exams so no need to be under pressure. If you have any questions he opens his office to you. In my opinion, if every teacher does his way, students can understand the course &amp; get great grades
Ben is a great and funny professor for a very difficult and math-savy course. If you want to do well in Calc III, I would definitely recommend taking this course with him. He is a very fair grader but it might take awhile to get back your test grades due to being very busy and grading for a big class. ATTENDANCE is mandatory for his class.
This is one of the best math classes I've ever taken. Ben speaks clearly and his notes on the board are easy to follow. He is not afraid to answer questions about the material in and out of class. The homework is not awful and we spend time each week going over problems from the homework. Over all he is a nice guy who can give an engaging lecture.
He was an engaging and amusing professor. Made the course material understandable and interesting. Was patient and easy to talk to or ask questions of.
Ben is super caring and helpful. He spends a lot of energy making sure everyone in the class understands the material- as long as your vocal about it when you need to go over something again. As long as you are willing to participate in class, it's he's a great person to learn Calculus from.
I took Mth 253 - Calc III with this instructor. If you do the homework problems and attend class you will do really well in this course. The exams pull material from homework and lectures and are problems you've had opportunities to work through. The instructor allows a note sheet on exams which takes the pressure off of memorization.
Ben is wonderful educator. He works hard for his students and expects the same from them. He is funny, unassuming, and very knowledgeable. His lecture are inspired and delivered with his natural charm. He is well-loved.
Ben is a nice man.
Ben was a good fair teacher. He expected all to participate, be present in class, and know your material for his tests. He was a good grader and if you tried in his class you will do well.
He's a good teacher. The exams reviews before the tests are very clear and if you study them you will for sure pass. Would take future classes with this teacher. Attendance is required and a big part of the grade, so you just have to show up.
Ben is a great guy, cares for each and every student and makes that clear from day one. Very accessible. He is a very funny guy.
Ben rules. He cares deeply about the progress of his students. He's kind of awkward and is always making hilarious jokes and encouraging a back and forth between students. I think it would be good to get more feedback on homework, but his study guides are really detailed so that kind of makes up for it.
Ben is awesome. Great guy, knows his calculus. Extremely reasonable. Treats students like human beings. Tests are easy, homework is graded on completion. Go to class, do the homework, study the review problems for the test, you'll do fine.
I've been at PSU for a few years now and I've never came across an instructor as good as Ben. He cares enough to know everyone's name by the first week of the class and he makes sure that everyone understands the material that he is teaching. This is the 1st time I genuinely enjoyed a math class lol. If you get the chance to take him then do it!
Ben is a calming presence in a sea of chaos. I feel lecture was more concept based and didn't get into enough detail. This leaves you having to do extra work outside of class. That said, this course is where the book wanders in coverage. He has a VERY dry sense of humor and is someone who helps you get comfortable with Calculus. Try Ben!
He is a fair and pretty laid back professor!

Teacher comments: 
Great teacher. Presents material in a clear and concise way so you know whats going on at all times. HW was 50% of grade, midterm and final were 25%. Cant really go wrong with that grading scheme.
Such a great professor who knows how to deliver the desired information briefly and clearly without useless things. A do-able and reasonable amount of HW every week worth 50% of total score. no textbook required. 1 midterm + 1 final, or 2 midterm (50%). Understand the main concepts easily and clearly. He Posts the lecture notes as well. take him!
clear and concise. He assigns very little homework, but expect the homework to show up on the exams. Exams 50%, homework 50% so it's pretty easy to get an A if you just do the few problems he asks you to do. He doesn't make you purchase a textbook and any concepts you need learn you can just Google it. Posts lecture notes online.
The best professor I've ever had! He makes statistic a fun course! He teaches in such a way that everybody understand the material!
Dr. Fountain is the best professor I've had in PSU! He has deep knowledge in the field. He makes the statistic so easy to understand.
Dr. Fountain is an incredible math professor. He is very clear and concise in his lectures and the quizzes are straight forward. You are allowed to use a sheet of notes on every quiz &amp; midterm. Use the sheet! Put homework questions and practice problems on it. The midterm and final are similar to quiz problems. If you hate math take stats with him!
He speaks fast in his lectures. The material he goes over is so detailed that you pray no one makes a sound for fear of missing pertinent information. Bring your Texas Instrument from high school and leave room for the free tutors on the second floor of the library - after 4pm most days  Take notes and write small bc you can use a sheet on quizzes.
Homework is graded very fair. Lectures are very straightforward and give you a good idea of the material. The assigned book was only used for homework, but was a good reference at times. Tests 50%, HW 50%. Tests not too hard.
Math has not been my strong suit for as long as I can remember. Professor Fountain truly made me understand math way more than I ever have before. He is very clear with his notes and explains what he is going over very thoroughly and precisely. Whether math is your strong suit or not, I would strongly recommend taking a math class with him.
He is great, although it is hard to reach him because the TAs are the ones you can directly ask questions. It was also very hard to know what my current grade was, because he didnt post up the grade and the TAs didnt too.
The best professor ever! He give you link to access for textbook so u dont have spent your money on it. His instruction and lecturer are clear and you will happy to be in his class.
One of the best professors i've ever had the pleasure of being one of their students. He was very clear and straight forward. He explains everything by writing down notes that he later on posts online, he also sent us a link to the book so that no one has to buy anything. There is weekly quizes, a midterm, a final, and 4 labs total in the term.
Robert fountain is the best math professor I've had so far while in college. I'm the worse at math!! His teaching style is what made me succeed. He's very organized, clear, simple and gets straight to the point. He writes his notes as he goes. He doesn't overload you with too much info. Weekly quizzes (short&amp;easy) and two exams (short&amp;easy).
By far the best math professor I have ever had. He explains everything in class and creates his notes as he goes, instead of having a powerpoint and just reading it to you. He puts his notes on his website right after class, which is really helpful if you miss some classes. Lets you out early every class. Midterm and final are cake, you get notes.
Dr. Fountain is the best math professor I have ever encountered. He has great lectures and will stop for questions even in a 200+ student lecture hall. The exact notes from lecture are posted online promptly. The exams are very similar to the notes and study guide. Go to class even though it isn't mandatory or you'll fall behind.
Great teacher! His lectures and notes were very helpful. I would absolutely recommend! One of the best instructors.
I had Dr. Fountain for Stats 244 lecture. He is very clear, very helpful, and to the point. Class will get out early every day, which allows you to absorb the material. He takes notes as he teaches and posts them on his website. The workload is very balanced. If you understand the material you'll do fine. Take him over the other math professors.
I had Dr. Fountain for STAT 243 and 244, and he's great. Super clear lectures, always doing at least two example problems that he walks you through for each new topic. All notes are posted online. He's very polite and helpful. He always only goes as long as the material needs, so you'll get out of class early a lot (sometimes like 50 minutes).
He had very clear lectures and the tests weren't too hard and we very short and multiple choice. Very helpful and gives extra credit so its hard not to pass this class. One of the best math teachers I've had and I would recommend him to any student.
Dr. Fountain is definitely one of the best professors I've ever had. Lectures are spent working through examples and the notes are always posted online. Quizzes and exams are exactly what he teaches in class. Answers all questions and really makes the content easy to understand for anyone. Take 243-244 with Dr. Fountain!
Teacher name: Kasius, Peter
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Incredible prof! He will help you understand it in office hours if you need help. Exceptionally glad that he is so reachable and explains things so well. Every step is clear, and if you need help he will spend as much time on the sticking points as you need until you get it.
Statistics with Kasius is pretty easy. He doesn't curve his exams but they're basically the same problems from the homework without any curveballs so if you go over the homework before the exams you'll do well. He's one of the nicest people ever so if you're having trouble definitely talk to him.
Professor Kasius class is solely lectures. If you already know the material it can be boring, but he goes step by step, and is very thorough in answering questions which is helpful for new material. Sad to say I never got to hear the famous sneeze :(
Very lecture heavy. You need to have good note taking skills, but don't stress too much. He has office hours and his TAs do problem sessions, so there's plenty of time to get help. I like to be more engaged during class, which isn't offered here. However, for lower level math classes engagement isn't terribly necessary.
Each class consisted of long-winded lectures and hardly any openings to think about or ask questions. Any homework assignments or practice problems did not reflect the difficulty of test questions, and going to office hours felt awkward. When I asked for more difficult practice problems, I was told textbook problems would suffice, but they did not.
He came off as an incredibly unapproachable teacher. I honestly think you should only take his class if you love math because he is so lecture heavy. Nice handwriting though, weird sneezes.
It is all lectures and his teaching style is not for everybody. Be prepared to work hard.
Don't take this class unless it is absolutely necessary. All lectures, no leniency with grading. Sneezes like a kitten.
He has a very clear, systematic form of lecture that is great for Math -- it's very step-by-step. He is a pleasant person, too, which is great. He is accessible after class and has very long office hours.
Dr. Kasius is clear and organized, but moves pretty fast. His lectures are pretty dull. He gives a pretty fair amount of homework, and has a decent amount of office hours. Not bad, not great.
Reading is required and it comes from the textbook. Prof. Kasius will go over the terms and definitions in class with some examples, from easy ones to hard ones. The lecture is easy to follow, and the homework is not hard. Also, professor Kasius is super accessible outside of class. Office hour for three whole days and he is always online.
Good professor who knows his stuff but he goes very quickly sometimes. Exams are extremely hard and the homework does not prepare you for them.
Sweet prof! Lectures can be a bit dull, but he really cares about the material and his students. Assignments are frequent but manageable, reasonable tests.
The class and the material themselves are very hard. He is a fairly good professor, though very dry.
He's a very nice and helpful professor. Easily accessible, because of his ample amount of office hours. The homework are pretty straightforward and easy to understand if you listen to his lectures. When I was still searching for classes at the academic fair, a professor teaching the same course even suggested that I take him instead of herself.
His lectures are really boring. His voice is very soft. His handwriting is neat. He assigns homework almost every class (only even problems without answers in the back of the text) and he gives 2 midterms &amp; a final that were extremely difficult. Office hours are really helpful. I heard Myers was easier for this class
Prof really knows his stuff, but lecture can be really dry. He has a lot of available office hours, but they are not always helpful because he only explains in words and not writing. He's very nice, and eased my anxieties about the course. Assigns homework almost every class period. Exams make up 80% of the grade and are tough.
He does problems in class but his explainations aren't always clear. Alternatives to his methods are not encouraged, save through the textbook
Kasius is so patient and nice. He dedicates a lot of his time to office hours which is really nice. He doesn't go too quickly through examples in class and is even pretty funny.
Boring and difficult
Teacher name: Davis, Tamara
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Very passionate professor and clearly wants to teach. She is really good at explaining topics and takes time to make sure her students understand her. Exams are straightforward.
Davis isn't the best, but she's much better than the other bio110 prof. Her ppts have the bare minimum, so you NEED to pay attention to her lectures in order to get the material. I would recommend recording her lectures just in case you miss something. Her exams seem to include a lot of material you don't cover in class, but she's a fair grader.
Most people really enjoy Dr. Davis as she doesn't just read from lectures. Unfortunately, if you are not paying attention for even a second, you have lost vital information that will definitely be on the test. Going back and looking at the powerpoints will not help as they are mostly blank and she fills them in during class. Great teacher though.
She is clear about what she wants from students on tests and gives good tests. puts in the effort so that you succeed. Over all great prof.
Tamara is wonderful! She is super accessible, very friendly, super inspirational, and really wants students to succeed. Her tests are challenging, but doable. Honestly one of the best professors I have ever had.
If you are interested in taking introduction to biology without much previous experience, I highly recommend to look through the syllabus and ask around before taking this class. This class was extremely difficult and very demanding. The exams are nothing like the powerpoint or what she really talks about in class.
Brilliant lecturer. It's possibly to get a 4.0 in this class if you attend every lecture and ensure you understand the material as the course progresses. Her exams are no joke but they're also curved so you don't have to freak out. Take this course if you want to be fascinated. Davis couldn't have taught the material better.
Tamara is the sweetest, most enthusiastic bio professor you will every meet. Her class is popular, however, only 3/50 students will get a 3.3+ gpa, and these 3 are most likely sophomores or juniors. VERY difficult course unless you passed AP Bio with a 5. Keeping up with her material and courses is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT IMPORTANT.
She is amazing and very good at explaining concepts. Do not be deceived for her exams appear to be simple and straight forward but there are many tricks and twists in the exam wording. Be sure to visit her in office hours and participate as much as you possibly can!
Awesome and really enthusiastic; she teaches her subject really well.  Her tests are difficult and you must study thoroughly for them.  Otherwise the homework load is pretty light.  But you need to sit for lectures because she explains everything clearly in class; the textbook is hard to understand
Dr. Davis is an amazing professor. Her lectures are amazing, and she really wants each student to understand the material. She is open to questions and the entire class time is very interactive. You will get the most out the class if you participate because her exams are not easy A's.
Dr. Davis teaches genetics in a confusing way.  Her homework is doable and in fact easy, but her tests are ridiculously hard and long.  She does not give partial credit and does not care if you fail her class.
SHE IS AMAZING! I loved her class, however her tests are difficult.
Dr. Davis is incredibly smart and makes the material interesting. She's there if you seek her out, but she won't come to you without you asking. Few tests mean they count for a lot, so make sure to study. Material is expectedly difficult, but Dr. Davis is the best person to teach it.
Professor Davis is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She is so enthusiastic and great at explaining things. Really loved her course!
Tamara Davis is the definition of a great professor. She is sweet, dedicated, and is quite sane although she repeatedly denies it ; ) She's very direct and clear and her exams reflect only what we've learned, practiced, and discussed in class (no random craziness). She's down to earth and practical. She has high expectations but they are reachable.
Very dedicated - tries really hard to make sure we understand the material. Good overall.
Dr. Davis was the best professor I ever had!!!  I am now in graduate school and I miss her everyday.
Intro Bio is really just an incredibly easy class. Chander uses power point based lectures but you still have to go to class because the power points can be ambiguous without her commentary. She knows a lot about her subject but doesn't have a hard time breaking it down for intro material.
I LOVED Prof. Davis!!! I took bio to fulfill the lab requirement because it seemed better than any of the options. she made me fall in love with biology, and even though i don't need to, i'm taking bio 102, and will probably even take more advanced courses. Her tests are a little hard, but she's great about answering questions.
Teacher name: Rescorla, Leslie
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She is so kind and so brilliant. There's a lot of work in her class, but it's so organized that if you follow her instructions you'll pass the class with no problem. The final exam is hard and long and you should definitely NOT cram for this test the day before. Many do not show up to the lectures, but she gives helpful examples so make sure to go!
Very specific grading criteria, hard class but definitely worth the work, very knowledgeable professor - if you pay attention, you'll learn to keep up with her intelligence.
Leslie's class are not for everyone. Her lecture class is in a packed auditorium, more than 70 people, some even sitting on the ground... She also talks *EXTREMELY* fast, and covers SO MUCH in one class. She's a nice and respected professor, though, if you get to know her. Talk to her outside of class, so she actually knows you.
Wonderful professor! If you're interested in psych, you honestly wouldn't find a better intro to psych class. I loved all the components of the class, including lectures, labs, and written assignments. However, if you're just looking for an easy science class, this one is definitely not for you. Lots of work. Moderate to sometimes tough grading.
Good class, interesting material. Lots of work but clear deadlines, and she gives a lot of second chances to make up quizzes, turn in labs, etc.
Intelligent, enthusiastic professor who really cares and is accessible outside of class, but do not take this class if you are just seeking your science requirement. It's so hard. The final is 45% of your grade. Quiz every week, 3 papers, and 5 labs. HUGE amount of work. Get ready to work hard or fail.
Hard class, but worth the work.
LOTS OF MATERIAL. Regurgitate exactly what she specifies in her instructions for the writing assignments. Weekly quizzes on lectures &amp; lab reports on stats, monthly article response papers (the hardest part of the class). Final consists of a selection of the past quiz questions &amp; a few essays. Lectures aren't mandatory, but they're a good idea.
You have to participate and be into the material. The examspapers do take time and effort, but I didn't find them too challenging. As long as you show her you care about learning about the subject, you'll do fine. She is intimidatingly smart, but also very approachable and clearly cares about her students. Very sweet lady.
Dr. Rescorla is an absolutely amazing professor. She has extensive knowledge of psychological theories, and her clinical fieldwork in developmental psychology adds to her lectures and makes for very interesting anecdotal teaching. The assignments are challenging (15-20 pg papermidtermfinal), but if you're willing to engage, you will learn a lot!
Prof. Rescorla is interested in psych and a good teacher, but I just wasn't that into it. The class is big enough that you don't have to participate and the labs are fairly easy too.
Loved the examples she gave in her lectures. She gave weekly quizzes online but they were super easy and you could just review the slides from the week before you took the quiz. Plus they factored into your grade which was an awesome way to pull up your average.
Tough class. TONS of material. But, she wants you to succeed. She'll email you if she thinks you're struggling. Make sure to space out the work. You CAN'T write a lab report the day before. Final is 45% of the grade, so keep that in mind when studying.
Prof. Rescorla is great! She's a smart, engaging, personable woman and I loved the classes I took with her. However, attendance is super important. Participate a lot! It'll only help you in the long run.
I honestly loved her. She gives about fifty examples for everything and if you have a question, all you need to do is ask and she will explain it until it makes sense. She made the material really interesting and relatable. You definitely need to participate, if you do she will remember your name! My advice? Participate, participate, participate.
I regret taking my intro class with her. She favors students that are familiar with the material already. Not a fan.
She is a really great professor! She is a tough grader but she teaches you all the things you need to know for an intro class ;)
The lectures were awful. She read off from the powerpoint presentations, and then she'd post them on the internet. I stopped going to class after the first few. Awful, awful. The labs were fun, I had fun with the lab with the TA.
She's amazing!  She knows so much about Psychology, has a true passion for teaching and psychology.  She is easy to talk to, extremely helpful, but expects a lot out of her students.
Not a huge fan of her. Hard to talk to and unsympathetic.
Teacher name: Greif, Karen
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She is nice to talk to as a person and is available for office hours and over email very consistently but she is a pretty hard grader and is pretty boring . Yet all of her material in lecture are very well outlined on her powerpoints so if you miss lecture then you at least have that.
Greif's classes are all based on her powerpoints and the only thing she really does is read off of them the entire class time. Her powerpoints don't even cover that much material, the textbook is better. Really unhelpful in giving back feedback and is a harsh grader to the point where it seems just unreasonable. Will avoid her for life if I can.
Grief grades in ridiculous and mysterious ways. Lecture did NOT correlate to tests. Reads from her slides but at least the slides are nice for catching up or if you fall asleep (easily). The only positive.
She's not a very good teacher and most of what she says during lecture isn't on the slides, so you definitely have to take good notes. She's a very harsh grader and answers on her exams are more about mind reading than the material. If you're struggling, do the analysis questions in the textbook, those are pretty similar.
Avoid her if you can. She's honestly both a terrible professor and person. She lectures the bare minimum and just reads off of her ppt. Her exam questions seem pretty broad, but she will only accept a specific type of answer, and she gives little to no feedback. She's the reason I'm no longer a bio/biochem major.
Dr. Greif does read mostly from her powerpoints, but her powerpoints are very informative and directly correlate to the test. She is good at answering questions, and very kind -- though a tough grader.
She writes very vague test questions, it is difficult to tell what she wants from students. She cares more about how you articulate the answer to a question than what you actually say. She is a very strict and picky grader, but is vague about how she wants questions to be answered.
The WORST teacher I have ever had. So boring, is not intellectually challenging, and relies on her slideshow for every class. My dean told me not to take her class and that many students had filed complaints about this teacher and her policies. Would NOT recommend.
Professor Greif's course was one of the most challenging courses I have ever taken. Her class is basically ppt slides every single day, a worksheet every now and then. Then two in class exam which are so broad and short answered and she's so tough on the grading. She's the reason I'm not a bio major anymore.
While it is true that she lectures from slides, Dr. Greif was a great lecturer, and very thorough.  Her tests were not too hard, but get ready to study and do the reading!  I also found her friendly and approachable when answering questions outside of class.  She also made her topic, cancer, really cool.  The perfect class for intro biology.
Avoid like the plague.
Professor Greif's class has a basic format. She lectures straight off of ppt slides and then gives tests that are about 10 short answer questions. Some people found the tests very challenging because they are ALL short answer, so you have to pull info straight from your head. All I can say is MEMORIZE THOSE PPT SLIDES, and you will be fine.
not really a fan. Dr. Greif is nice but as a prof, she just reads off slides for an hour.
She is an incredibly hard grader. However, if you meet with her before your exams and ask her what she expects of you and you do it...I guarantee you will do well. She comes off as incredibly intelligent and intimidating, but in one on one encounters she is sweet and helpful. Meet with her!!
I really like her, but you definitely have to put in time and effort. The test questions are pretty open-ended, but if you are more of a conceptual learner instead of someone who is able to memorize minutia then you will do well. She's super nice if you reach out to her and is understanding.
Her lectures are not interesting and she is monotonous, so it is often very difficult to pay attention. She claims her tests are based off of her powerpoints, which often lead to the "I'm not going to class" attitude. Her tests are not "normal" bio exams, they are unclear&amp; open ended. Not very encouraging either. Turned me away from the bio major.
Greif is really smart and crystal clear in lecture. Only problem is u don't get any practice or hint before exam. If u don't review lecture material or work on ur own, the exam will make u die. Average is about 50-60%. But if u work hard enough, u'll easily be the top5-10%.
She is extremely helpful and inspirational if you approach her during office hours, though she is not very good at lecturing. Her exam questions is well-developed and really require a deep understanding of the course material, which is kind of challenging but beneficial in the long term. Also, she is not a gpa killer as rumoured.
It's so easy to fall asleep in her class because she turns the light off while reading off a her slides. I don't think she know how to teach, yet she grades very harshly. She insisted that attendance is important because this is a discussion class, yet no one really talks in her class because there is just not much to say.
At first I did not like this class and did not like this professor at all.  However, after a talk with the professor, this class went much more smoothly, and I understood a lot more.  Yes, she reads from slides, but she also has interesting segways as well.  She grades hard, but it means you earn your grade, and it's not just a fluff class.
Teacher name: Harte, Tim
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Loud and nasal but in a good way. Smart, friendly, chill, good looking, disorganized but very passionate
Tim is friendly and easy to work with. He wants you to do well. He is not afraid to put you on the spot, but he is light-hearted about it and will work through whatever you need. He can be a little messy, (sometimes disorganized and doesn't really know how to use technology) but it doesn't hinder your learning and it's what makes him fun.
Hilarious, class is always a blast!
Tim is very understanding and helpful during office hours and conversation sections. Great for First Year Russian.
Tim is the cultural and conversational professor for 1st year Russian. Sometimes the cultural lectures are disorganized, but he's overall very good: passionate, responsive, and willing to discuss things.
Tim is an amazing professor. He is high energy and gives fantastic lectures. He perfectly fosters a lot of student involvement, which contributes to how interesting his lectures are. He gives a lot of reading, but it is interesting. He is also super helpful in addressing any questions.
This was, quite possibly, the most pointless class I had ever taken. I did not learn anything useful in this class and half the time Harte didn't know what he was talking about.
Tim Harte is an amazing teacher. While some lectures can be hard to follow, overall the amount of knowledge I've gained from him is vast. If you are confused, you can easily contact him and he is there to help. Would recommend all Russian literature classes he teaches
Mediocre professor. Nabokov class wasn't my best experience at BMC.
Tim is a helpful and supportive teacher! He supervised my independent study.
Tim Harte gets a bad rep, mostly due to his somewhat awkward personality and disorganized lectures, but for the most part, he is a passionate and interesting instructor. If you put effort into the reading and class discussions, you will learn a lot, and his class is graded in a pretty reasonable manner.
He is friendly and engaging, if a bit awkward. A lot of class discussion is student-led, so if you come prepared, you'll learn a lot. Overall a nice guy and a decent teacher.
He's got no sense of humor and his analytical skills are really weak for a PH.D. I liked Chekhov before I took his class. He effectively killed my interest. Too dry.
If you're willing to apply yourself, Tim is an incredible teacher. Funny, smart, and willing to spend as much time helping you as you need. If you're not willing to put in the effort, his classes might not be the best, as he doesn't spoon feed the material.
Prof Harte appears to be unassertive. But I think if u really know ur stuff well and ask him specific questions, u often can get a lot out of him. It seems his primary goal is to help students HAVE FUN learning about arts  - as for assignments, I think as long as ur writing is clear and u support ur thesis well, he will give u very good grades.
Tim Harte is not a good teacher. He was very vague, never labeled slides for this class which was annoying and his feedback wasn't helpful at all. Nobody else teaches Russian Literature or Art classes in Bryn Mawr. So you're stuck with Tim Harte if you're interested in these subjects (monopoly).
Dr. harte is passionate about Nabokov and knows his stuff, but he has inflexible specific expectancy for his assignments he is never  clear about. I wish we had more writing assignments and more clarity.
Harte is a great professor hands down. He is incredibly passionate about what he teaches and his Russian Avant Garde class was very informative. I learned a lot, and the movies we watched and artworks we discussed were fascinating. Additionally, his feedback on essays was super helpful and he's really funny.
I didn't like the class. Harte was very vague about what he expected. It's kind of mean to be harsh in grading when you don't make it clear what you expect. He is definitely very unassertive and insecure. The more insecure he gets, the louder he gets.
Tim was a wonderful professor. I took his Silent Film course and it was very evident how much he loves the subject. I am now taking another class with him mainly because he is the professor.
Teacher name: Arribas, Ines
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
There is a lot of content to go over in this class, but it is manageable. It is very easy to fall behind if you are not used to regularly doing homework on a set schedule. It's also important to go to EVERY class, she will know if you're not there and your attendance grade will suffer.
Professor Arribas is very kind and is always willing to give you extra help if you need it. There is homework every day but it is manageable.
She is amazing! She is great at teaching and engaging.
She cares about her students, but she definitely reduced my interest in Spanish last semester. She wants all of her students to do well in her class and learn the language, but she does not want to adapt her assignments to people with learning disabilities. Sometimes, she'll be pretty rude. Other times, she'll be nice.
Profesora Arribas is an amazing professor! She is very passionate about teaching Spanish and is very active during class. You actually learn so much from going to her class! Spanish is definitely one of my favorite subjects now. She is available for office hours and goes out of her way to make sure her students understand the material. Recommended!
Professor Arribas was a great teacher but it was definitely tough. You get homework every night, you have a writing homework due once a week along with a mini quiz, there are chapter tests and midterms! The class is engaging but make sure you are on top of your work because she calls on people. All of this allows you to learn better spanish!
Profesora Arribas is unbelievably supportive. She's challenging-even demanding- but she will always go above and beyond for students who are struggling, but engaged. Do the work, and she returns your effort ten fold. Also, just an incredibly warm human being.
Very engaging and exuberant teacher. She can be a bit disorganized (posting the wrong homework, writing quizzes last minute), but in general she cares about her students and will teach you a lot. Expect a lot of homework though!
Señora Arribas has the most beautiful, clear voice. She's accessible to both beginners and advanced students, and makes even the most basic Spanish students feel excited about their capabilities. She's exceedingly helpful, both in and out of class. She's down to earth, and though she definitely makes you work, she'll always meet you half way.
Dr. Arribas is quite a bit scary and intimidating. She teaches well and is very passionate, but you have to work hard to get on her good side. I would definitely take her class again (I learned a lot!) but I'm pretty she doesn't like me : Definitely show up to classes, do the readings, participate, hand in assignments on time, etc.
She is awesome!!!!
I absolutely love Profesora Arribas. She has so much energy, and really devotes her time to helping her students out. She is also easy to talk to. She won't just give you easy A's, but almost every grade you get, you can redo/edit the assignment and improve the grade.
Prof. Arribas is amazing! She does pick on people in class but it is expected you have already completed your homework. She gives a lot of quizzes and exams but makes sure you understand the materials and format. I came in this class with zero knowledge of Spanish but I am now able to have a short conversation in Spanish at least!
I loved Arribas, she makes the class come to life. She teaches as though she were dancing the whole time, its like watching a performance -definetely a work of art. Do the work and study hard, don't miss class, and you'll do great. She's also a brilliant humanitarian. She is the woman I'd like to be -confident, sassy, compassionate, &amp; so gorgeous.
AMAZING professor! She is so sweet and kind. You will learn A TON in her class. She is the reason I continued to take spanish classes even after I fulfilled the language requirement.
this class is definitely hard. you have to show up everyday and know your stuff, because it's guaranteed that she's be asking you for answers the whole time. it's not an option to be quite. still, she's lots of fun and an amazing prof
very good professor, engaging and really helpful.
Pretty hard....you must come to class! Can't 'get by' with just knowing the bare minimum....she LOVES to call on people in class and ask them questions....do not take if you're looking for an easy spanish class!
She knows her stuff, but is very intimidating at times.  She demands a lot but if you are really into the subject, it is worth the effort because you learn a lot.

I love Matt Ruben. He is so funny and caring and is always available to help. take his classes!!!!!!
Ruben is fantastic! I have him for the Poverty and Affluence ESEM, which is the best class I've taken yet. He's very engaged with students, incredibly knowledgable about his subject, and gives helpful and constructive feedback. He's also hilarious and class discussions with him are always enjoyable, especially since the readings are so interesting.
Matt is honestly the best professor I've had during my time at Bryn Mawr.  I had him for his American Poverty &amp; Affluence Esem, and it was by far my most interesting class. He's a tough but fair grader, and he gives plenty of feedback on your paper drafts.  He worked a lot with me because I had personal problems during his class, wish I did better.
PROFESSOR RUBEN IS SIMPLY AWESOME! OUTSTANDING PROFESSOR!
A really understanding professor. It was definitely a class I looked forward to. Readings were also quite enjoyable.
I loved this class and Prof. Ruben. He cares so much about his students and clearly wants you to succeed. I never found any of the assignments too hard at all, the workload was very manageable. He likes discussion, whether it's about the homework or not. He wants to make the class laugh. I'll jump at the chance to take a class with him again.
Matt is a helpful and inspiring professor. He listens to students' ideas and leads good discussions in class. The readings materials are also very selective and informative. AND, he is smart and fun and one of the best prof ever!
"Poverty, Affluence, and American Culture" is one of the sections for ESEM, BMC's required writing class for all first yeartransfer students.  It was my favorite class. The readings were amazing and the seminar was primarily student directed. Ruben gives constructive feedback and is incredibly supportive both academically and on a human level.
Matt Ruben for president!
I took Prof Ruben's ESEM, Poverty, Affluence, and American Culture. It was my favorite class. The readings were interesting and class was largely discussion based. Prof Ruben gives good feedback on assignments and really cares about his students. I had trouble at the beginning of the semester and he helped me work things out and get back on track.
matt is funny, nice, and has confidence in everyone. i'm in his writing sem, a kinder way of saying "remedial academic writing" - i'm a creative writer. his notes on drafts are ridiculously helpful, and meeting with him or workshopping in class always sparks new ideas. he truly believes we can write well, and teaches simple ways to get  us there.
Great readings, great professor.  One of the best I've ever encountered...and you'll learn a lot too. Take this class!
I have my ESEM Poverty, Affluence and American Culture with him. HE IS SO GREAT. He is quite sarcastic and has a sense of humor which makes his class so interesting and fun to be in. Such a nice and sympathy person. Very clear about what he wants you to do in your paper. Very helpful when discussing the drafts in general. I LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM.
An excellent professor who facilitates class discussions well, has a sense of humor, and is respectful. His feedback on writing was thorough and helpful. Class in interesting through use of a variety of media types.
Wonderful professor. Thoughtful, kind, and very entertaining. Creates a great classroom atmosphere.
Professor Ruben is a respectful, thoughtful and engaging person who is passionate about his work.  His criticisms of my writing were some of the most helpful I've ever received.  Classes are lively and discussion-based.  You will never want to miss class.
prof. ruben is a great professor and a cool guy. he makes his expectations clear, and class discussions are always really interesting. i really recommend his seminar on culture/poverty!
Matt is a great teacher. Our class (intro to writitng, with a focus on Poverty in the U.S.) was very discussion-based. He likes to hear people talk a lot in class. Not too hard a grader, and his feedback is very helpful (especially during tutorials). His class really opened my eyes to something I knew very little about. I recommend him!

Teacher comments: 
yeah
He was my introduction to college and for that I am so lucky. He changed my writing with his amazing feedback and helpful office hours. His reading is interesting and not too heavy and he really allows for amazing class discussion. He is the kindest man and it radiates through his class. He is interesting and engaging and a great professor.
Prof. Briggs is  the sweetest and he will help you if you need it!
His classes are conducted mainly in a lecture format (though comments are very much welcome). He is the most brilliant man I have ever met, and has a way of explaining authors, books and poetry in a way few others know how. HIGHLY recommend this (or any other) class with him. I highly doubt you will regret.
The sweetest professor ever!
Brigss is such a sweet prof. Just make sure you figure out the writing style he prefers early on and don't deviate from it in your papers. He's super kind and so relaxed. Class was very relaxing as we just sat there and talked for 1.5 hours about various books. He likes it when students make connections to their own lives.
Professor Briggs is definitely the best English professor I've ever had.  He's such a sweet man and is so open to all students' ideas and opinions about the reading.  His class is such a great environment because of this. I really enjoyed his class and I can't wait to take another class with him!
incredibly knowledgable, passionate, kind professor. gives great feedback on written work and is always willing to help you with the material. take a class with him!
AWESOME!!! He's so sweet and genuinely loves what he teaches. He will inspire you no matter what level your interest in English. Must take one of his courses!
The words "adorable old man" come to mind. Really nice guy, gave me a HUGE boost in confidence with my writing. Interesting, engaging, mentally challenging and stimulating. Take one of his classes if you at all can.
Very helpful and accomadating!
caring and has a sincere interest in his students.  always willing to give positive feedback.  MUST TAKE ONE OF HIS CLAsSES!

The man is the GREATEST english prof. I've had all of my four years here. You HAVE to take his class/es at least ONCE while you're at Bryn Mawr.
No matter what you said he'd find some genius in it. Really great at boosting student's belief in their thoughts...
Best English teacher ever.  Nicest and most helpful too.  Cannot rate highly enough.  Super!!

Great lady! amusing outfits hehe!
She is a wonderful professor, very helpful, very kind, takes a keen interest in students' well-being, and funny to boot!
She is nice, but I struggle at calc and had a better teacher in high school. I don't know why everyone thinks she is so wonderful... She also moves way too fast.
Love her, hated math. Her teaching made me think about majoring in math. But I realized that All of my courses would not be taught by her. Fantastic teacher. I got a 4.0 in her class and I hate math. She's just a great teacher. Thank you, Cookson!
I loved cookson!! She's amazing and a great teacher!!!!
This woman is amazing....   **so much fun to be in her class during hell week**
The only person on Earth who could ever make me love math... Thank god for teachers like her.
Cookson is a math goddess!  I swear, she can teach math to a rock.  She taught it to me and I hate math.
Cookson is a math goddess!  I swear, she can teach math to a rock.  She taught it to me and I hate math.
COOKSON ROCKS!!!
I LOVE Prof Cookson - what a wonderful lady!!
BEST math prof ever.  eneregetic, fun and interested in her own material.  her stories are the best and she is very good at clearly explaining concepts.  she is always willing to chat with you if you need help.  beware she moves quickly!
The best math teacher/prof I've *ever* had.  Talks (and writes fast), gives incredibly clear explanations of how to do problems, makes class *fun*.  If I could have her as a prof for 4 years, I would seriously consider majoring in mathematics.
I love this woman! Not only is she funny, but helpful and intelligent. It's a shame she's on leave for Calc 102 next semester!
AMAZING!  She makes calculus seem so easy.  I highly recommend taking any of her classes!
I had to take Calc for my quantitative requirement...Prof Cookson is amazing, she has SO much energy that its hard to hate math.  SHe is very clear, and explains all concepts from the beginning rather than assuming a lot of prior knowledge.  Awesome!!!!
Amazing. She made class fun, but more importantly, taught extremely well. Her lectures were concise, clear and wonderful.
Teacher name: Truitt, Elly
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
SHE IS HAAARD, and expects a lot out of her students.
Truitt takes her subject and her students really seriously, and is definitely not interested in any nonsense from her students. But if you come prepared you'll learn a ton. Also, she loves tv, which humanizes her.
Professor Truitt really (really) scared me for the first part of the semester, but she grew on me in a major way. I feel that I have learned the material thoroughly, and she makes it interesting. She is really good about answering questions.
Professor Truitt exemplifies the most difficult Professor. Not only is her coursework difficult, but she teaches her material in such a way that it is very difficult to comprehend. Moreover, she is extremely flighty about her tests and quizzes and requires you to write really short papers. Only plus is that she'll let you rewrite papers.
Elly Truitt is one the the most knowledgeable professors at BMC. Her classes are engaging and you never once doubt that she loves what she does. E.T. definitely cares about her students and strives for a sense of community in her classes. She gives dense readings and will expect you to have done them. Take her classes, but come ready to work for em
Charming, intelligent, helpful and responsible. A fair grader.
She is very intelligent, but her teaching skills are weak. Her grading is inconsistent and unclear. She does not give criticisms that allow you to improve, simply gives you a bad grade with no explanation (even if asked in office hours for explanation of what was wrong with the paper).
Elly Truitt is a stone cold fox. A doppelganger for Stacy from What Not To Wear. Do not take this class if you plan to slack off and not do the readings.
She focuses on writing and would make a great ESEM/Thesis prof. You will receive a below average grade on a paper that she gives an "Excellent" for content and grasp of material if you don't use good writing skills, which is ridiculous for a History class.  She also doesn't have a great grasp on the content she teaches compared to other professors.
Prof. Truitt is a tough cookie. She is honest and direct at all times. She truly helps with your quality of writing and is tactful with her assignments. She brought homemade muffins some mornings. It was always fun to try and impress her and so her class can be motivating even if the material seems dull.
Professor Truitt is definitely a challenging professor and expects a lot out of her students, making them work hard and do their very best.  It is clear that she is passionate about her discipline and even though she may seem intense in the classroom, she is such an understanding professor outside of the classroom.
She's a hard grader and expect a lot from you - but this is how you learn. She's ridiculously smart but very approachable. She has very high standards but is always clear about what she wants from you! She brings bagels to us in morning classes. She says your American Apparel outfit is awesome. She gossips stuff in an intellectual way.. I love her!
Really smart, really enthusiastic, really clear, really helpful, really hard. Her classes are fun and also rigorous.
Amazing professor - very clear and shows a passion for the subject. She is a harsh grader though, especially on essays, but makes you aware of her high expectations.
Very, very hard professor. Can be quite condescending and discouraging at times. Assigns a lot of homework, and is a particularly tough grader of essays.
Amazing, amazing professor. She expects a lot but is very clear on what exactly she wants. She makes you want to work hard and really understand the material.
Has high expectations, but makes them clear.  Gives good lectures and is clearly enthusiastic about the subject matter. Class is tough, but enjoyable, and I learned a ton.
Teacher name: Grobstein, Paul
School name: Bryn Mawr College

Teacher comments: 
Paul was amazing. He was so helpful in and out of class. I learned so much in his class because we talked about EVERYTHING. I wish I could thank him for everything he did for me.
Professor Grobstein was an incredibly engaging and downright lovely professor. I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to share stories with him. He will be greatly missed.  -Rebekah
This is not a traditional science class by any means, in fact, it's a great class for non sciencey people who need a science credit. But it is definitely Grobstein's element. Other people complain about his philosophizing but that is exactly what this class is about so it was perfect. Fun, interesting class.
Paul is an amazing professor. He was able to take very complex principles and fully explain them to the class. I left the class with more than I would have every hoped for. He teaches science with a philosophy twist, and although I started the class completely perplexed by the natural sciences, I now feel passion for them. Great experience!
he is great for none science majors who want to learn some science, but if you are a science major i would suggest you find a different professor.  he spends the whole class talking about his idea of science, but he doesn't actually teach it.  When he does, he dumbs it down to an insulting level.
No Comments
I don't know what people are talking about. Prof. Grobstein is one of the best professors I've ever had in my life. If you really want to learn something, take his class. He really makes you think critically about issues instead of taking them at face value. How many teachers make you do that?
He was WONDERFUL!  My favorite teacher thus far.
this guy can talk his butt off. half the time i think i'm philosophy class instead. hardly any use of any text.  all discussions which i guess is good for a liberal arts school to a point but he's out of hand.
Paul needs to teach the science before he can philosophize about the principles of science.  Frankly, you are wasting money by taking this class.

Teacher name: Brena, Dina
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I had Professor Brena for Span001, 002 and 102 and she's one of my favorite professors. She's very helpful and really cares about students' learnings. She always encourages me and help me with my spanish pronunciation. In addition, I can see that she tried very hard to organize different class activities thus making the class more interesting.
I had Prof. Brena for Span 001, 002, 101, and 102 at Bryn Mawr College. She was one of the best professors I had at Bryn Mawr and she made the material very accessible and interesting. She engaged students both in and outside the classroom and really encouraged everyone to explore all different areas of interest.
BreÃ±a was such a caring professor and was always super helpful when I visited her during office hours. At times during class, I had a hard time understand her expectations, but she was always open to clarification. She was kind and I found her very dedicated to her students and what she taught!
Profesora Brena was absolutely wonderful! She is engaged in the class, and is genuinely interested in educating us about Latin America and Spain beyond simply learning grammar points and vocab. I learned a lot, and it was a class I never regretted attending, she always makes class interesting and fun. Overall, excellent course, highly recommend it!
Enthusiastic about teaching, very approachable and dedicated to her students. She is also always willing to help.
Dina Brena was by far my favorite Spanish professor in terms of teaching style and personability. She is extremely willing to offer assistance to students, and she is truly invested in helping each person do well. She manages to challenge students while offering a fun and stimulating classroom experience! I highly recommend her classes!
Professora Brena was one of the best professors I've had in college. While the lectures sometimes confused me, she was EXTREMELY helpful in office hours and spent a lot of additional time helping myself and others with things we didnt understand. If one is willing to put in the time and effort, they will absolutley LOVE Dina Brena.
I personally had a great experience with Profesora BreÃ±a. She was hilarious and really engaged with her students. She was always willing to meet with me and was always very professional in class. Hands down one of the best Spanish professors I have ever had.
Very easy and entertaining.
she's irritating and doesn't explain anything properly.
On the whole, she is a good professor.
Like another person complained- there are periods of miscommunication with Breña in which it will always be the student's fault. The syllabus homework was difficult to understand and project dates were changed on a whim. This teacher isn't for everyone and can be more than a little frustrating.
She Brates her students. I don't think she likes to teach.
enthusiastic teacher  compassionate person  speaks something like four or five languages fluently  willing to help in any way approachable
English is her second language--she can be difficult to understand, and when she is confusing, she will often blame it on the students.  Although she does not grade too harshly, her class can be a headache, because you have to work hard to figure out what the homework is.
Teacher name: Blank, Douglas
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
There were assignments every week and required a lot of work. But the homework allowed me to be creative. It was hard but actually pretty fun.
Doug is a good teacher and always willing to help. I found his lectures to be understandable and the homework reasonable.
I took the intro cs course, not knowing what cs was! I wasn't sure I would like it but it was great! There were lab assignments due every week. I'm thinking about majoring in cs
good, solid course. i liked it
The class cs206 was a good introduction to cs. Prof was available outside of class. I learned alot!!
Good course and good introduction to cs.
Doug is a really nice, well-meaning guy, but not a great professor. He is scatterbrained, disorganized, and is a horrible introduction into computer science. Students who have prior experience find it way too easy, and students who have little to no experience (the target audience of the class) have not grasped the basic concepts by the end.
Doug is one of the best professors I've met. Always crystal clear in his instructions and willing to go over the concepts patiently with you in class if you don't understand. He's there for you when you have questions and really cares about students' learning.
I came to the college ready to be a computer science major, but both his intro class and data structures class left me feeling incompetent in upcoming cs courses. I recommend taking your cs courses as haverford if you can!!!
This class was very boring and very dry. To be fair it was a writing class and not his forte BUT that's the point. He was not helpful at writing at all and quite frankly the class was a pain. It also didn't help that we didn't get any feedback until the last week of classes.
AWFUL Professor. RUN FAR AWAY FROM DOUG unless you are already a computer whiz. Then you will be fine.
CS 206 and 245: He went over the same few concepts again and again and again and... He wraps everything in nice metaphors and avoids using "scary" CS terminology whenever possible, leaving us inadequately prepared to take classes with other professors. Doesn't have time to meet with students, reply to e-mails or grade homework.
No Comments
He abused a mandatory core class to make us work on his research project. Also "forgot" to teach any material that was not directly relevant to his project (e.g. 2 of the 3 languages the course was supposed to cover). Avoid him if you can!
He assigns hardly any HW in higher-level classes. After a few weeks he realizes that no one remembers anything from the beginning of the course, and then you will spend most of the semester reviewing the first few weeks of class. Does he know that we invest less than 30 min/week into his classes? ... His robot intro course is fun though!

Teacher comments: 
Irina is a really bad lecturer, constantly gets way off topic. She is very arrogant and looks down at you. Classes are a big waste time, not engaging and not interesting. I am very surprised to see some positive reviews of Irina's work. I have a poor opinion of this class, low quality classes.
Everyone who has taken Irina's class absolutely adores her. If you don't love Irina, you haven't taken her class. Her classes are engaging, her workload is manageable, and you learn a lot. She is more than happy to help with anything and will work to find a time that works for you.
Irina's class is really engaging and she is very helpful in and outside of class. She really cares about all of her students. I don't understand how her rating isn't 5/5. EVERYONE should take her class!
Irina is the best professor of all time! She cares about her students so deeply. She is beyond knowledgable about all of her subjects and it shows. Irina is the most helpful professor. She makes sure she is very accessible outside of class for all of her students. She is a clear grader and she is so engaging. She inspires everyone she teaches!
Irina is not a caring professor at all. She didn't strike me as being knowledgeable either. When she doesn't know how to answer your question she would answer anyway, even if it's incorrect. It wasn't helpful. She can be arrogant and abrasive too.
Irina is the type of professor who will move heaven and earth in order to make you feel supported and ensure that you learn the material, even outside of class. She's a fantastic professor who generally makes her subject matter very clear, however. She brings an infectious positive energy to every class and fosters a positive learning environment.
Irina is one of my favorite people on the planet! Her class was approachable, and she saw I was struggling and actively tried to help me succeed and understand what she was saying. She genuinely CARES about her students. Yes, there is work, but that is to be expected in a class that focuses on language proficiency
Irina seems to want her students to learn and truly understand the course material. I learned an incredible amount in her class and felt inspired to continue learning Russian. She always opened her door to students who needed any help with work. Irina always came to class prepared to teach and answer questions. She the bomb and helllaa smart
She talks down to you. She's self-righteous, unyielding  to reason. I did okay in that class, but didn't want to take any more classes with this teacher again. Not so great!
Irina is not my kind of instructor. She doesn't explain things well and although she likes to give you a big smile and tries to be funny, you see she's a disciplinarian when you work with her long enough. Strict and can be abrasive.
Irina expects a lot from her students, but it is clear that she is always there to help. She's always positive and in a good mood and comes to class no matter what. You will have to work in her class, but you will learn so much.
I really like how Irina incorporates various materials, often poetry and movies, to accentuate what we're learning and to provide some cultural context. She's always happy to answer any questions. The only downside of her classes is if you're taking more than one class with her she often schedules all her tests in the same week.
It is evident that Irina cares about her students. She is very personable and knowing that she wants you to succeed, makes you work harder.   She keeps class interesting by utilizing different different materials (clips/poems/films). Her great sense of humor makes class a joy.  The work load comes in waves and a little, then a lot.
Overly confident. She didn't address grammar that well. If you don't get her answer to your question, she doesn't explain it any other way and thinks most of the things are elementary. She always speaks like she knows it all.
Irina is a new instructor. She grew up in the Soviet Union, but her English is very good. I wouldn't recommend her for an everyday class. She has a different teaching style and can be overbearing. Although she's nice, her voice was in my head 247.

Teacher comments: 
I usually lurk on this site, but I HAD to write a great review, because Dr. Lukacs deserves it. She does a lot of extra behind-the-scenes work to make sure that the material is fully grasped by her students. And SERIOUSLY if you encounter any problems, just go to her. But you have to be prepared to give it your all, too.
Dr. Lukacs is AMAZING. She is always available to help and her labs help you understand the course material!
I suggest you get on her good side asap by being magically brilliant at Chem and be one of the few kids that finishes in 50% of the time because otherwise, you will not get any special treatment and she probably won't like you. Make sure you do ALL the work and if you are confused, don't ask her, ask your TA. Lab is only worth 30% so focus on Lec
extremely helpful. get back to students ASAP and really good explanation for things
103/104 Krynn was AMAZING, the best lab professor I've had thus far. She's always sooo helpful and she never makes you feel stupid for asking ANY question. Plus, she gets back to you ASAP for any questions (as in I've gotten literally instant replies from her before, which is great)
she is AMAZING.  so fantastic. she teaches things incredibly clearly.   the labs she designs beautifully complement what we are learning in class but pushing the student a little bit farther
Great prof.

She talks like the textbook
Teacher name: Beard, Linda-Susan
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She's a really nice person and is always happy to talk with you about your ideas/rough draft. She is definitely a tough grader - so I would recommend talking to her before you write up your essays. You'll learn a lot but you have to already be a pretty strong writer IMO. If you're worried about your grade definitely talk to her, she's flexible.
Professor Beard is amazing. She's a tough grader, but if you prove yourself, her classes get easier and easier.
She is an awesome professor. She is very serious about giving feedback and pushing students to think critically. She only steps in to clarify a point or to add her two cents. She is very receptive to criticism and she is loved by many.
I loved taking Black Bards with her this past semester.  There  was a lot of writing and reading, however it was all worth it.  The writing was two one page single space responses every week.  It sounds like a lot, but you get used to it and then you feel so accomplished like FOR REAL
Beard is the most unique and wonderful professor I've had at Bryn Mawr. If you can pause to understand her style of teaching- she can guide you to becoming a more critical writer and thinker! Plus she rapped in class!
Professor Beard is incredible. She is informed and open to all students and opinions in discussion. She is very accommodating. I learned a lot from this class.
If she doesn't like you, you're screwed.
morally sound.
She was my senior thesis advisor.  Her former advisees and I concurr that as an advisor, she is as effective as a slab of haddock: she is lovely and encouraging to talk to, but just nods and smiles instead of actually advising.

This is an excellent course for all interested in African Lit.  The discussions are provocative and I would never ever skip a class.  She's great when she gets into the higher level courses--  I had her for english 250 and despised her.  I love her now, though!

She's a whack-a-doodle. Very  in touch with her feelings and her god.  Gotta love the nun who wears sparkly sweaters one year and her habit the next. I disagree with her that Toni Morrison is a literary genius.

Teacher comments: 
DK is a wonderful prof who cares about making connections with students. He was always encouraging us to meet with him in his office not only for academic help, but to get to know us better. He was very engaging and is one of the better professors I've had at Bryn Mawr.
Assigns like 300 pages of reading a class but only 20 pages of it is mandatory. Makes you do reading responses that are pretty easy to BS. Easy enough to get by in his classes but they're kind of a waste of time. He might have known what he was talking about back in the 80s, but times have changed for sociology and DK has not.
Hes an idealistic man and very knowledgeable. However, the amount of reading that he requires is over the top for a 200 level class.
good
DK is extremely arrogant! He will twist your words and ideas to make it into his own!
He just drones on during lecture. His lectures feel like an eternity, he is a tough grader and can never seem to clarify anything. He's all about office hours, I prob would have done better if I went to them
He is a great professor and got me interested in sociology. He is a tough grader because he partially expects you to read his mind, but if you talk with him and ask questions about your assignments you will do well. He knows what he is talking about and encourages class discussion.
Sometimes his idealism got in the way of practicality. Good course, good man, you will learn a lot. However, he just sometimes had grand plans and ideas that didn't work out so well in practice and he got mad when they didn't work well.
love professor karen. he asks a lot, but the readings are always right on, the memos are always thoughtfully read, and he's always up for a good argument.
Love it or hate it, Karen's classes are truly democratic. If you know what you want to get out of a class, he's more than happy to oblige.
David Karen sold me on soc. before I'd ever taken a class.  If ever there was a guy in love with his field! I envy the '08 soc majors who get to have him as their major advisor. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more understanding and helpful professor- definitely worth the effort to make it to office hours.

Teacher name: Nerz-Stormes, Maryellen
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Nerz is a really great teacher. She's available for office hours pretty much all the time. It's not an easy class, but she curves the tests heavily. If you put in the work you shouldn't get lower than a B/B+. She suggests reading Klein but I would just use that as a starting place. The problems in Klein are MUCH easier than her exams.
A gem of not just the department, but the school. It was a blessing to take orgo with her! You'll still have to put in work because it is orgo after all, but she will help you every step of the way. Above and beyond. A superhero. Make sure you go to lectures(!), recitation, and office hours!
Most talented organic chemistry professor. Very clear &amp; fair about grading, expectations are clear, open and supportive to different study methods. Made organic chemistry fun.
Absolutely one of the kindest professors I've had thus far. She's very accessible outside of class (she even has office hours on Saturdays!) and very understanding about illness/personal emergency. There's also not a lot of homework for the class. Her tests are curved, and she offers extra credit. However, her syllabus is a little hard to read
Dr. Nerz is amazing. I never found myself bored in lectures; time flew by. She really cares about all of her students and she's pretty much always in her office ready to help when not teaching (even some Saturdays!!) Dr. Nerz is an incredible woman and she made orgo fun!
Amazing woman, yes, but her personality goes into her teaching. She's not afraid to be a little kooky,  can be disorganized at times but will really try for you to understand the concepts. And coach you through the course so that you do  well. She is extremely devoted to students, and we love her.
She spends so much time in her office, and is always glad to help students out with any questions. Her tests are very long, but she is a fair grader and gives a lot of partial credit. Overall an amazing teacher, would recommend.
Though she tends to get off-track often, and the class ends up being behind, Dr. Nerz is always trying her best to help students learn the material. She has a ridiculous amount of office hours - some are even on Saturday. She provides lots of materials for students to work with. And, she is very generous with grading.
Dr. Nerz is a wonderful and supportive teacher. Organic Chemistry is seldom easy, but she made it engaging and understandable. If you get lost or stuck, she has TONS of office hours, and is ready to help you however she can.
Dr. Nerz teaches Orgo, which is obviously a very hard subject. But she wants every student to pass/get good grades and will help you. She even has office hours on Saturdays! She is encouraging, she even sent us "words of encouragement" after our first exam telling us that it gets better and it's only the first test!
She is a passionate and engaging teacher. It's hard to make organic chemistry easy, but she makes it 10x more bearable! I cannot recommend her enough.
I have watched her videos on online and she does such a better job in teaching NMR spectra. Best and better than my professor who CANNOT teach organic chem!
She is one of the greatest professors i haver had. She loves organic chemistry and goes above and beyond to help everyone in the class.
Dr. Nerz-Stormes is seriously the best professor I have ever encountered. We are so lucky to have her as part of the chem department. She has copious office hours, is the sweetest lady you'll ever meet, and truly understands organic chemistry and wants you to too. She really encourages students to come and see her and provides very clear coverage o

watch out, he'll be great in the classroom, but kill you on grading.
I wasn't prepared for this class. The courses I took before made me feel like knew something about L-A lit. Then I learned I needed to relearn. Amazing experience.
Great guy. Emailed when I was sick to send me assignments.
Amazing! Great lectures, intense, be prepared to work. Will be easier on exams than you'd think. He's generous though he looks tough.
I don't know why Penn has to borrow local talent from Bryn Mawr. This was hands down the best course I've taken yet at Penn and will bite the bullet to get into his class next year.
ok, i don't know what prof you guys had but he responded to emails days later, never showed up on time for meetings that we scheduled, and when he was there, he would be there with another student and look at me like i was intruding on something when we had SCEDULED an appointment.  never checked up on me and he was my thesis advisor!
Best teacher I've had yet!!
No Comments
omg! responds to email within the hour and calls me when i'm not well to make sure i keep up with material. is he for real?
whew! got into lima's lit 310! had him for 110 and he's intimidating but super smart and really cares in my experience. if you are lazy he will figure you out so watch out.
No Comments
Lima will waste your time with unorganized class discussion and impossible readings.  Then he will give you tests that make no sense and grade them at random based on how he feels at the time.
Lima was one of the worst professors I have ever had.  He's so arrogant he doesn't he can't even admit that he's an inefficient teacher.  I hate the fact that he was tenured.  He doesn't deserve it.
Teacher name: Wright, Nathaniel
School name: Bryn Mawr College
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I'm not sure where all of these reviews about fangirl problems are coming from--it's never been a problem in any class I've taken with him. Nate is a great professor. His lectures are excellent, but beyond his teaching skills, he responds to emails very quickly, makes himself available for questions, and is generally very understanding/flexible.
Yes, Nate is hot. Yes, the fangirls are annoying. But Nate is also brilliant. Wade through the overwhelming waves of estrogen to get to the front of the class and ask some thoughtful questions, and you realize that he's there to lecture, and absolutely brings it, every single time.
He's so adored because he's brilliant, clear, and a genuinely wonderful person. If you're going to take this class, put the work in as I think he was disappointed with the lack of intellectual rigor from my class. It would have been great if everyone pulled their intellectual weight.
Pros: Fun classes, very interesting and informative, manageable work load. One of my favorite professors on campus.  
 Cons: I agree with the review complaining about the fangirls. The hype is there for a reason, but it gets to be a bit much at times. Wright just seems bemused by it all.
Good professor, good man, excellent classes, very clear. Unfortunately, his fan-girl base is very frustrating in class, and sometimes one can not heard the academia through the "omg! nate, i looooooveee you &lt;3"
Nathan Wright is GOD. He is the best prof ever. Even if you don't give a damn about sociology, you will after his class. If he wasn't married already, I'd propose to the man on the spot just for his mind.
Professor Wright is amazing!
I LOVE PROFESSOR NATHAN WRIGHT!! HE IS SO BORING YET SEXY IN ORANGE!!!!!!!!! By the way, my friend and I are his two biggest fans!!!!!!!! We're so crazy about him that we wrote an essay for him!!!!!!!!
Amazing. Got me interested in the sociology major.
i LOVE doc wright. he's AMAZING. EVERYONE should take a class of his. he assigns alot of reading, but i'm never bored in class. i'd marry the guy if he wasn't married already!
knows his stuff... and no one can pull off a rock concert tee and wrinkled blazer like nate
Oh my god, I love this class.
Nate is awesome, he's a great teacher, he's funny, and I've learned SO MUCH this semester. I wasn't even interested in the class (I enrolled to fill a hole in my schedule) but now I want to minor in sociology. The work isn't too hard either. Yay for Nate being here and not Northwestern!
Teacher name: Pinder, Jon
School name: Wake Forest University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
belittles you in office hours and makes you feel dumb
Jon is great. Polarizing, but great. He prepped me great for my summer internship and is a really great human.
He literally tanked my class, and was reprimanded by the university for it.  If he doesn't believe in what you're doing, he'll protest with indifference toward you and your grades.
Dr. Pinder is an awesome professor who is always smiling and really wants his students to succeed. The first half of the course is much easier than the second half so don't get too comfortable, but Dr. Pinder will help you with anything you need - just ask. I would definitely recommend taking his class. Also is excel skills are unmatchable.
Jon is one of the best teachers Wake has to offer. He can take a class of MBAs and make them experts in excel and stats. If you show interest in the class he will go to great lengths to help you out.
Easily one of the best professors I've ever had (no, didn't go to some small no-name; had undergrad at a large public T15).  I've had classes with both Quant professors, and you just can't go wrong with Jon.  He genuinely cares about the students in his own goofy way and does his best to make sure that every student learns something useful.
What I learned and applied is simply outstanding!! Jon is polarizing for many love/hate. At 5+ years removed, I still use these skills in healthcare and foreign assistance work. Most of all, use these skills for yourself!! Get ready for serious work, though. Life is more than living by numbers, and he tries to teach that too.
I graduated in 05; I can safely say Pinder teaches nothing you will use in the real world. He makes quant unnecessarily hard, sets you up to fail, then offers a helping hand (which was never very helpful). If you play his game, you'll do fine, but don't believe the 'pinder show' hype.  Boone is better...he teaches you what you really need.
Jon is a very tough professor and will not hesitate to call students out in class. His grading is strict but is rigiruous (he will re-read your papers 2 to 3 times). He is very helpful if you come to him with the "What did I do wrong?" attitude and a little defensive if you approach with the "My answer is really right!" method.
Very interesting personality - I can see how some students like him very much some not at all. He is very smart and knowledgeable and goes the extra mile for you if you show interest and commitment. What he teaches is hard stuff and you can't skip-read, you must work hard. I wish I could attend the class again.
fantastic
Jon's Quant Methods course is one of the few courses I remember enjoying in the FT MBA program.  It was hard, but the lessons have been extremely useful since I took it in 2001.  I would love to take it again as a refresher!
Whoever is disparaging this guy on here needs to get a clue.  I've been out of his class 5 years now and I use what he taught me every day.  People with Quant abilities get paid a helluvalot more than those who don't, so I'd say I owe him about $50K in thanks.  If you connect with him, you're set.  A great guy.
Jon is hard, class material is hard, but it is worth it.  This class will certainly help me earn addition 50K-100K.  I wish the pace was slower, but it is ok. The best thing about him - he loves what he teaches and definetely carries you to the world of quant methods with enthusiasm.
Very challenging, but you walk away with tools to succeed.  Material cannot be learned in one sitting, so prepare to struggle daily.  Difficult grader at times.
This guy is super smart but a total ****. In the end I got a lot out of his class but I'm not sure it was worth the daily beratings. When I heard this guy got Teacher of the Year I thought that they must have run out of professors to give it to. Arrogant and whiney. Spiteful at times and loves to make you look stupid. And is good at it.

Teacher comments: 
He was the worst professor at Wake Forest Law.  I think he got off on making students feel nauseated and incompetent.  [Tips: Outline dump on the exam and ignore him when he says to use the terms "reference above" for questions on the exams you have partially already answered in a previous question...you are better off retyping answer for each ques
Incomprehensible, but a nice guy.  Teach yourself the course, as he never talks about the crux of anything.  He's always on the margins, and NEVER addressing any meaningful concepts.
You have to teach the class to yourself because most of what he focuses on in lectures is not relevant to the subject matter.  Use supplements and OUTLINE DUMP on the exam.  Regardless of what the questions are, put everything you know about Civ Pro in the answers.  I cannot stress enough that you put everything you know about Civ Pro on the exam.
Love the person; Can't stand the professor.  Better off learning from a supplement.  Go to class to see where he is at, but don't use anything he says.
i couldn't imagine a worse teacher.  avoid like the plague.
Mad Dog can be hard to understand, here are some tips to survive:  if there is a paper option, take it!!! Then you won't have to figure out what it actual material and what is vintage Mad Dog conversation.  Don't let him scare you!! He expects a lot but as long as you're prepared for class and make a reasonable effort you'll be fine.
You guys are wimps.  This man is a  genius.  If you let him...he will teach you how to be great lawyers.  If you expect that practicing law will be easier...then you are mistaken.  I wish there were more like him.
Worst professor I had in all of law school.  He might as well have been speaking Greek in class, as nothing made any sense all semester.  I highly recommend anyone taking Civ Pro I from Walker to completely ignore class notes and purchase the Arthur Miller Sum &amp; Subtance CD's, which are the only reason I got an A in the class.
George K. Walker is the bane of my existence.  Tips to survive: At the beginning of the semester, get the Arthur Miller CDs (listen to them now! don't wait till Exams).  Get the High Court Case Summaries.  75% of what he says in class is useless; reading the cases also won't help unless you already have a fundamental understanding of the sub. G/L
Nice guy out of class, but for a subject as basic as Civil Procedure, I really think a professor who can give new students a good base in the subject would be a more effective use of my money.
He teaches a lot of material for his own benefit. The reality is the subject matter is difficult enough and he makes the obscure more obscure.
Very helpful. He really teaches you to think on your feet.
Very old professor who is very hard to understand in class.
Prof Walker is very hard to understand.  He does not speak clearly and uses the same outline from 20 years ago

She was amazing!  She is truly a Renaissance woman.  Professor Angelou often began class by speaking in Latin, French, or Arabic.  She often shared fascinating stories with the  class about her experiences.  Her point was simple -- education can come from more than just a college or textbook.  I highly recommend this professor.

Where exactly did she attend school? Does she have a degree? Or are we to assume that she is just a natural genius. I would also make an argument that she is a horribly redundant and insipid writer, not "inspirational"
Arrogant, spiteful, rude, boring - and possessing a thoroughly mediocre intellect.  The only thing that humanizes her is the supsicion that her incessant bullying stems from an awareness of just what a fraud she is.
Im sorry, great author or not she was a terribly unhelpful professor...she doesnt have a love of teaching..more of a love of self. It irritates me that Wake hired her just b/c of her fame..fame doesnt make you a great prof
Dr. Angelou is helpful towards all students who are serious about their studies.  At first, I was skeptical about her class but after a week or so, I saw Dr. Angelou to be the true inspirational professor she really is.  A fantastic motivator and I hope to have more of her classes in the future.
Very helpful, caring, and an inspiration to all!  Dr. Angelou is DEFINITELY a SHINING STAR for Wake Forest.
Very helpful and caring towards ALL her students, even though there are those who bad-mouth her because she takes no junk from these SLACKERS!!  If you want to learn, Dr. Angelou is the professor to have.
Inspirational!
Accessibility?  Yeah right-- you'll find that her on campus office is actually the bell tower!

Teacher name: Grebeldinger, Susan
School name: Wake Forest University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I had Grebeldinger for Civ Pro 1 and 2. She is a tough grader and sets high expectations, but she is very clear about what she wants. If you take notes, listen to the lectures, read, and apply feedback then you should have no issues in her class. Tip: She doesn't like stupid questions. Only ask a question if it is relevant. Best 1L professor.
Lets just say that when a professor sends out a 12 page email regarding her pet peeves, beware her grading.
If you follow her very specific instructions and pay attention, you can't go wrong.
Most straight forward professor ever.  Make sure you state things her way or else she'll take off points even though it was the right answer.  Anti social and a little crazy.
One of the best professors at Wake!
People skills are lacking. Not helpful.  The class is somewhat straight forward though.
A little odd, however she tells you exactly what she wants and does not hide the ball; refreshing in a law school prof.
If you don't understand what she is teaching you, you are the problem.
Very bad professor.  Very.  Throws information at you and you can't ask questions because it takes her out of her precious schedule.  Wake should save money by just taping her class and playing it back to students.
The class was not interesting, but Grebeldinger teaches in a very clear manner.  I also appreciated her system where only a portion of the class is on call each day, taking some of the stress out of the 1L experience.

This is her gig, and she shines.  Much better than Civ Pro.
She is anal-retentive and vague and just overall rude to everyone.  She expects certain things on exams but won't explain what she wants.

School name: Wake Forest University

Teacher comments: 
Ever wanted to cry in a class? After taking a class with her, you will.
Excellent class - not sure why there are all these negative reviews...she's fantastic
She is tough, but as long as you pay attention (read don't screw around on the internet all class) you will be fine.  Only problem is she is machine gun fast with some material and if you zone out you will miss something.  Seems unapproachable, but if you actually go to her office she is helpful.
It's a good class and she's a good teacher if you pay attention and do the work
Why is she teaching?  Acts pissed off all the time.  She just can't be bothered.  I think she really hates students, or is just painfully shy.
The one professor in my life that I have truly wanted to throw my computer at. I'm serious. She's the problem with tenure.
 
 On another note, hopefully one day she'll smack her forehead or bang it against the board hard enough to realize that she's supossed to teach.
While she may be challenging, Roberts' teaching style gives students an opportunity to learn and apply the law on her own- end the end it all comes together.  If you can't learn how to figure out the law independently in law school-good luck being a lawyer.
Talkes about her biking, expects you to learn the law.  Plays favorites
Could not care less about students.  Waste of time.

Teacher name: McMullen, Patrick
School name: Wake Forest University

Teacher comments: 
Humorous and amusing in class. Very difficult to work with outside of the classroom and does not offer additional support or assistance.  Grading appears subjective as there is no rubric, and little constructive feedback on assignments.
Pat is one of the most amazing and approachable professors @ WFU; he genuinely cares about student learning (not grades) and inspires students to take learnings beyond the classroom. He's a real asset to the facility of the University; I would definitely take him again if possible.
Nice guy.  Made class interesting.  Pay attention to the small tidbits &amp; asides as he finds a way to include them on the exams.
Good professor.  Went a little fast at times which was hard for us non=computer people but all in all a good class. WAY better than Quant 1!!!
Great teacher. Great class. Great tools.
I've heard this guy sucks via email but since I never tried I can't comment on that.  He told us he was brief, though-almost as to forewarn us.  I though he went out of his way to help us understand this stuff actually.  We had extra tutorial sessions that he absolutely didn't have to do--but did.  The final was tough but 4 the semester he was fine
Turned what could have been a great course into a trainwreck. Two-Faced, refused to answer students questions in class! At $300 a student hour he should be ashamed!
CB demos were very helpful.  His lectures were a little dry.  His grading was way too tough for a 1.5 credit graduate class.  He treated us like high school students.
Nice guy, but class amounts to nothing more than long drawn-out Crystal Ball demo's. He messes with the lighting in class constantly during these. Also he has different expectations for "performance levels" between his quizzes and tests - a tidbit he will not mention to you until after the fact.
Two personalities, a friendly face in class and nasty and mean comments through e-mail.

Do not take her class! She has no idea how to clarify anything. Students with prior experience with computer science are most likely to do well.
I don't think I've ever had a more dysfunctional or opaque teacher in my life. She doesn't have any clue how to communicate any information. I would give a 0 for clarity. Her labs are insufferably unclear as to what she wants you to do. She's still explaining in class what she actually wants THE DAY IT'S DUE. If possible, avoid her like the plague.
Unfortunately not the best professor. I had her for my FYS and she was basically incompetent. She's REALLY sweet, nice, and cares deeply about her students. She tries to explain fairly irrelevant things often, but at least she's nice.
Lots and LOTS of enthusiasm - perhaps too much - and a trivial class. Seems to have the most interest in bringing concepts to the classroom with cutesy little animations and getting students Excited and such. Lectures are information-sparse, quite a lot of trivial demonstration of mathematical operations (filter masks and such). We get the idea already!
agree with the last rating
Avoid. She really has a PhD in CSC?
Terrible teacher!  Avoid at all costs.  She's easy only because she's stupid-- the course has NO structure which makes it very difficult to learn from.  I can't believe we pay people like this to waste our time!!
She's a very nice person, but the course was way too easy.  Not her fault though.  She is very fair however, when you bring things to her attention.
Prof. Burg is very cool.  She will take the time to help anyone who is trying, and she explains the material well.

Pleasant, giving instructor.  Takes the time to ensure you learn the material.
Teacher name: Franco, Dean

Teacher comments: 
He honestly is my favorite professor. He genuinely cared about the success of each student. I'm so glad I had him my first semester here at Wake.
Prof. Franco is awesome. I went in to his office hours before every paper and he was super helpful. I am an science-y person, but I kept up with the readings and participated in class which really helped.
LOTS of reading. Not many grades besides the large papers, but he's extremely helpful and encourages students to see him before they turn it it. It's all discussion so be prepared to talk about the texts or it'll be awkward
One of the best professors I've ever had! He runs the class as a discussion/ seminar, which really forces everyone to read and prepare for class beforehand. He is an extremely tough grader of essays, but I improved my writing abilities 10-fold after taking Dr. Franco's class. He really got excited about the literature, which is also a strength!
He's a good teacher with good ideas. The class is very interesting and the texts are wonderful. Take it!
Excellent, I'm definitely not an "english person", but with a decent amount of time and interest, I learned a lot and truly enjoyed the class.
Great teacher
awesome teacher and a great guy who will do anything to see you succeed.  really inspired me to want to be an English major.
By far one of the best professors you're going to get here, he will literally jump through hoops to help his students.  A must take.
Hidden gem of Wake Forest faculty. Incredibly intelligent, very helpful, entertaining. I wish all professors at Wake were this inspiring.
Super sexy
Teacher name: Sternlieb, Lisa
School name: Wake Forest University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I think Lisa is a fantastic prof. She will challenge your pre-conceptions and she has high standards (neither of which are a bad thing). The only people I know who didn't like her or her class were those who either did not read the books or were not interested in learning anything new.
Boring and bad discussion.
I just couldn't get into this class.  Her approach to every novel was the same -- feminist, feminist, feminist -- and it just got old.  I just can't believe that's the only way to approach this stuff.  Plus I didn't find the professor to be very helpful or accomodating.
Best class I had at Wake. Lisa is a phenomenal prof, and she really makes you think. It's true that she's tough, but she's very helpful and always willing to help. She forces you to approach your ideas in new ways, and she's always willing to listen to what everyone in the class has to say.
too blinded by her own huge ego to be either fair or rational as a teacher.  the only views welcome are those which mirror her own.  never again.
abrasive + agressively opinionated + surly personality + ineffective teacher = STEER CLEAR!!!
Prof. Sternlieb was without a doubt the worst teacher I've ever had.  She is unhelpful, condescending, and extremely bigoted.  If you are a guy, don't take her--she hates men!
She was more interested in talking about how evil the Greek life at Wake is than discussing the books we were supposed to be reading.
A truly remarkable woman--she changed my life.
difficult and unhelpful.  What was that with the body comments below?
For some of us Lisa is more than just a great teacher: she's an inspiration.  I used to hide under layers of clothing, but Lisa's comfort with her own body, her willingness to wear red, changed my self-image completely.  Thank you, Professor Sternlieb.

Teacher comments: 
Better suited fr undergrad teaching. For a Masters course dealing with experienced professionals he came across as arrogant. He loves to explain the Algebra and Calculus. Not really required for an MBA -- a better use of time is this is how you use it in excel and this is how your interpret the data. I got more in study sessions with a tutor.
Can take very long time explaining a concept, preferred if he would let student get entire question out, before starting to respond.  otherwise seems genuinely interested in students success.  Just try to be a specific as possible in your questions, because if you don't know, "H' he will want to start all the way at "A' before moving forward.
Not sure a prior negative critique from another reviewer was deleted.  Explanations were lacking and confusing.  His examples were okay, but class discussions would have been better if he was more open-minded and listened to what students were saying/confused about.
stubborn. always took way to long to explain questions to class.
He is very good at giving you examples and projects that help you see the concepts at work in the real world. I found the Marketing Research class that I took with him to be extremelly relevant to the career for which I was preparing. Teacher is very nice and with good humour at times - it's a pleasure to attend his classes.
Good professor, a little arrogant, but made material easy to understand to someone without a math background
Very good teacher.  He explains the meaning of Quant and places emphasis on understanding methodology versus memorizing formulas.

Made quant really easy for me to understand.
If all professors were as helpful, clear, smart, and nice as Derrick, the world would be a better place.  Top 5 instructors of all time.  He actually makes math interesting and fun.
Teacher name: Whaples, Robert
School name: Wake Forest University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Whaples is a legend in the school.  From his daily quizzes to challenging test- he will make you work for your grade.  That being said, he curves his test grades and many people received good grades.  You will exit the class feeling as if you have a firm grasp of economics and will be ready for an Econ major or for the Business school.
Excellent professor! Makes economics relateable and incredibly interesting with humor and incredible teaching ability.  Oh, he's hot!
TAKE WHAPLES!!! He is a fantastic teacher with a goofy sense of humor. You will learn the material and his lectures are clear, interesting and fly by. Easily one of my favorite professors at wake.
I took Whaples' Current Economic Issues class, which was great! The class was interesting, and much more reading-writing based than the traditional Econ class, meaning much less graph drawing and math to do (a big plus for me). There was a fair amount of homework, but if you actually do (most of) the reading, getting a good grade was not hard.
Very enthusiastic with an entertaining sense of humor..gives semi-daily quizzes and occasional readings but overall the class isn't too difficult. would definitely recommend
AWESOME teacher, good guy.  He actually wants people to get good grades and that's what I like about him.  I took the entrepreneur FYS class, be prepared to do A LOT of reading but if you are remotely interested, most of it isn't bad.  I typed 4-5 short papers total.
Extraordinarily good teacher. Explains things with a lot of very good examples, and will be incredibly helpful out of class. Wish he gave a little more time between homework assignments and their due dates, though.
Great class, very intersting, well structured, brief intro to micro econ and then mostly discussions.  Read 3 or 4 books and wrote papers, one long final paper and some group work but nothing that felt extreme.  Was supposed to read the NYtimes every day...never did, overall really enjoyed the class
Excellent. One of the top 3 I had at Wake Forest.

While I am terrified of her upcoming exam, Professor Parker is easily one of the best instructors I have ever had. She is obviously smart, but is also organized, approachable and funny. She made me actually look forward to learning Civil Procedure.
She is the best professor at Wake Forest.
She is an AMAZING professor! I had her for Civil Procedure and, while I don't care for civ pro, she made the class really fun and interesting. She is one of those professors who is really approachable and fun and it's not until you listen to her teach the you realize she's brilliant too. I recommend any class she teaches!
This is a very delayed review. I took professor Parker in the fall of 2008 and she was far and above the best professor I have had in my life. I am now an academic myself and aspire to reach the lofty bar she set in my mind for what defines truly exceptional teaching.
She tries to make class fun, and does a pretty good job.  She is also very organized and gives you the material in a straightforward way. However, it's very apparent that she really prefers male students over females.  She is just much nicer to them and more interactive.  This isn't a huge deal, but it bothers some people.
Great costumes. Drinks lots of seltzer.
Hard grader but excellent  professor.
Very organized; easy to outline.  She does however, use the same examples EVERY year; ie Monk.  And, she knows what an ATV is - don't fall for that.  Pretty straightfoward if you pay attention in class and write up a decent outline.
I love you Wendy Parker.  You are a great teacher.  Thanks for making my first year at law school so much fun in the mornings.
yow; she's good.
Teacher name: Boseovski, Janet
School name: Wake Forest University

Teacher comments: 
She is a pretty good professor. She is now at UNCG. The classes are based on powerpoints that you HAVE TO KNOW to do well on the tests, but you also should invest in reading the book. She offers extra credit in the form of outside lectures, and she makes your lowest grade count for less.
I had Prof B for Developmental.  She knows her stuff really well.  Mostly a powerpoint oriented class, tests are not easy, but not impossible.  There is also a 20-hour community service requirement for this class, which wasn't bad at all.  Good class, good teacher.
Class mostly consists of PowerPoints. Decent teacher, but major control freak. Sets a lot of very particular picky rules about the class - they aren't particularly burdensome, but they get to be extremely annoying. Respect is something earned, Ms. B, it's not something you can drag out of people with Rules.
Excellent class.  Doesn't give out A's, but tries her best for everyone to do well.  Highly recommend taking her...
Great professor, interesting class, drops your lowest exam grade which is always appreciated
Great prof. Great dresser. Go Yankees.

Favorite professor at wake! really entertaining and engaging classes. make sure to pay attention to all his analogies (and use them on exams/paper), even if they don't make sense the first time around. once you learn the material, it all clicks into place.
my favorite professor.
This guy has to be one of my favorite teachers at Wake. He's hilarious and smart at the same time. It was refreshing to not have a professor who takes everything so seriously all the time.
The most entertaining lecturer at Wake- Loved Con with him and found him extremely helpful outside of class-
Great professor...I really enjoyed his classes...though several people didn't like him....guess it depends on your personality
Entertaining, although I have no idea what I actually learned.
Had him for Con Law I and II, thought he was confusing and probably insane.  Took him for Comparative Con Law and Jurisprudence because the classes sounded good and found out that Parker's a lot of fun in smaller classes. Don't let Con Law scare you away!!  These classes were two of the best I took in law school.
Smart guy. Bad teacher.
Teacher name: Salam, Akbar
School name: Wake Forest University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Grades by only 4-5 tests. Does not give extra credit. Lectures aren't interactive.
Too smart to interact with the public. Doesn't know how to convey what he is trying to teach.
He can't interact with student  the only prof in our department that no research group. he is so rude
really arrogant he can't teach you any thing so rude and makes you feel stupid
Don't waste time with him.
Hard grader with very difficult tests
Professor Salam is very fast when giving his lectures, and although he is brilliant, his objective comes off as unclear to his students.  He doesn't use curves when grading his tests, and expects the average of the test to be around a 75.  If you have him, teach yourself the material through the book rather than relying on him to clarify.
Professor Salami teaches primary from power point slides with very little textbook usage. Outside class work is mainly optional, with only 5 homework assignments per year. However, tests are ridiculous. Often, he makes concepts more difficult to understand than they actually are. If stuck with Salam, learn from the book, it is clearer than he is
Teacher name: King, Angela
School name: Wake Forest University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. While tests are standardized amongst the Organic Chemistry II professors, 1/3 of your grade will be determined by her quizzes and final supplement. Gives pop quizzes and normal quizzes almost every other class and they are incredibly difficult and not curved. If she is the only option do not take it that semester.
Good lectures. Unfortunately unless you live, breathe, and bleed organic chemistry, these will do you no good. The exams are next to impossible and quite unreasonable for the amount of time allotted. On top of that, she usually coordinates lab, and it is a disaster. Just ask the poor TAs that have to work for her.
GRADE DEFATION. She takes joy in making test too long and difficult.
Wonderful teacher, puts a lot of effort and excitement into her teaching.
She does not keep up class discussion. She grades you ridiculously hard on research papers by grading you down and not having an explanation why. She devises a points system out of no where to justify giving you the grade you receive.
Dr. King really sparked my interest in Chemistry.  Her tests were hard, but fair.  You really have to learn the material to do well, but she is very understanding and helpful if you ask.

Very clear, very helpful, expects alot of students, but not unreasonable. Study and and do well on the homeworks and you'll soar.
Teacher name: Furmanek, Olga
School name: Wake Forest University

Teacher comments: 
ola furmanek is definitely the hardest professor i have ever had but by far the most influential. she expects effort and will not allow for anything other than your best. she pushes her students but it really just helps her students improve. she is wonderful and i have so much respect. take her class. highly recommended
She is a difficult professor. In our (interpreting) class the homework was vague, unclear and exceptionally random. The last presentation (an entire class period powerpoint) was very vague, and I remember one group had to redo their project because they didn't have what she was looking for. Many students did feel embarrassed at some point.
Professor Furmanek DOES talk down to students and she has laughed at serious answers students have given in class. Her notes are not comprehendable what-so-ever, she just writes random words in sloppy hand writing all over the board in every direction. She does not use powerpoints, over heads or blackboard nor does she prepare notes prior to class
It's been forever since I took this class, but I remember loving it.  Furmanek is a very brilliant, passionate teacher.  Talk philosophy in Spanish, she will love you forever!!!
What shocked me was Furmanek's treatment of her students. Some she embarassed in front of the class, others she held to unrealistic standards they couldn't meet &amp; then she'd get angry. She got snippy if you asked for help or clarification. But then she did let me reschedule my final Fall Semester.
This course was very demanding and you really have to know Spanish.  The class is conducted entirely in Spanish and is very challenging.  On another note, Professor Furmanek's notes are not always coherent and hard to follow.  Take her if you a SPA Major.
Furmanek was challenging for my honors 213 class, but our class learned a lot and I know I improved my spanish skills.  Participate in class and you will do well.  The funniest thing-she kind of joked some other Spanish profs once (giving us sched. advice
Teacher name: Robinson, Stephen
School name: Wake Forest University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is a really nice person and is clearly passionate about the subject he teaches. Sometimes, however, he does not explain the problem(s) or topic(s) as thoroughly as he should, which can cause some confusion. I would suggest doing as many of the bonus questions as you can and memorizing not only how to do certain problems, but the theorems.
Before I took this class, I really hated math. It confused me, and just didn't make sense. I can honestly say this professor has really changed my outlook on the whole thing. He doesn't start with high up theorems, but rather with a problem solving approach. His tests are very fair, and the homework he assigns really helps. Highly recommended!
Great teacher. Great class. Just keep up with all the homeworks and ask questions whenever you have them and you will be fine. Also make sure to do all the extra credit assignments.
Excellent and one of the best teachers - EVER!!!

Professor Robinson is easily the best teacher that I have had so far here at Wake.  He truly cares that his students learn the material and explains complicated math equations clearly enough to make them seem obvious.  Take him!!
This is the nicest guy you will ever meet.  Also, he knows his material and keeps you interested in what he is teaching.

awesome teacher. intro to hindu traditions was very interesting but not too much work. would definitely recommend taking a class with dr. whitaker, even if you're not interested in studying religion
He's a really cool guy, but be warned- his classes are RIGOROUS. A ton of dense reading. He rarely ever gives A's. He really likes to challenge his students, so if you're up for it, take Whitaker.
Absolutely amazing professor, his classes are hard to get into but if you've taken a class with him before or go to his office hours he gives it pois. Everyone should try out his classes, they supply good information but most importantly they make you think. Great professor.
good discussions, lets the students give input.
No one should graduate without taking this professor at least once.
Great prof. Interesting class discussions.

Teacher name: Loveless, Andrew
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He gives so much extra help and is super caring. Tests are easy enough that people mostly lose points for sign errors and silly stuff, which makes the curve a bit vicious.
Dr. Loveless is the best instructor I had so far. He is very responsible for students questions and spare a lot of time for review before midterms and final. He also provides a lot of useful materials for review and practices. Strongly recommended to take his class.
AMAZING teacher. He provides his students with every opportunity to succeed, and really cares about his students learning + doing well. He sent out weekly newsletters with helpful info, and provides everyone with old exams, practice problems, notes from lecture, and review sheets. He loves when students come to office hours. Cannot recommend enough
Loveless is the best, seriously made taking this class a breeze. He even did so well teaching the course that he was allowed to make the median grade .4 higher than what the department recommended. He was very thoughtful and encouraging with feedback about exams as well! Very fair and admittedly very easy class
Dr. Loveless is one of the best professors I have ever had! I did not have any pre-calc/calc background going into this class but his lectures made everything so easy to understand! Start the homework early and ask for help when you need it (very approachable and WANTS you to succeed)! 10/10 recommend but you have to put in the work on your end.
Loveless is an amazing teacher who really cares about his students and is very accessible for help. He does a wonderful job in lecture making methods clear and understandable. Only negative is grading system gives anyone at average grade a 2.9 GPA, and our class has had high exam percentages. Which makes it very difficult to get even close to a 4.0
Dr. Loveless is the best! He takes hard concepts and breaks them down into digestible segments. Not only that but he's easily the most likable and approachable professor I've had so far. I'll be taking 126 with him next quarter, and I'm actually looking forward to it!
He is really helpful and explains every detail in his lecture. Wanna boost your gpa? His class may not be the first choice for you. His test is pretty easy so you might fail to get a std above median just because you make some calculation mistakes.
He is really excellent and approachable. He does care about his students and is always willing to give you specific advice about how to improve your grades. He has his own website for almost every class he taught and you can always find lots of useful resources on it. In class, he can always make difficult concepts clear and understandable.
Web assign is $100? (most classes it's 20-60) AND assignments due 11pm instead of 11:59pm? First homework assignment is easy but VERY long. Other than that he's a nice professor.
Dr. Loveless is one of the best instructors I have ever had! He presents tough topics in a straightforward way that makes math accessible. If you can, go to his office hours. He truly cares that you understand the materials and gives students multiple opportunities to come to ask him questions, especially before exams.
Loveless is awesome!!! Come to his Calculus class and you will love math
Loveless gives very good lectures; he gives lots of examples and walks you through problems well. He is very clear in his expectations of you for midterms and the final. One thing to note: in my experience and from what I have heard from others his midterms are easier than other professor's, so be ready for the final. The textbook is terrible btw
This is a hard class, but if you go to lectures and do the homework it is almost impossible to fail. He provides lots of ways to get extra help and has a very well organized website. The only issue is, because he is a good lecturer, his averages are pretty high.
He is a phenomenal teacher who is very accessible outside of class, sent out weekly newsletters, and tips on how to manage the course load. The only critique I have is that while his online notes were helpful, difficult problems were hardly worked out. He emphasized doing homework for test but tests were actually a lot harder than the homework.
Loveless is awesome but since he is such a good professor the text averages were very high which made my grade suffer. He is one of the best calculus professors I have had here at UW. 10/10 recommend
Definitely one of the harder classes, but Loveless in a caring professor and his lectures are super clear. He also sends out weekly newsletters with tips to succeed and general encouragement that make you feel connected to him even though he has hundreds of students.
Consider yourself lucky if you get him: he's by far one of the best math teachers I've ever had. He is super thorough in his lectures and office hours, and often went through the hard problems from homework in class. His online notes are also top notch; you can use them even if you don't have him. Tests are difficult but graded fairly.
This man is by far the best math teacher or professor I have ever had. His lectures are extremely clear and he tries his best to make them interesting. Gives very specific tips and tricks to do well on exams. Take his class if you get the chance.
One word - RESPECT

Teacher comments: 
Bio 180 is probably the most well-run class I've taken at UW. The topics are well organized, the learning material is clear, and there is plenty of help available. The way the lectures are formatted is really interactive and interesting too. Great professor and class!
Dr. Freeman is an amazing professor! He knows how to handle a class of 600 freshmen and sophomores, and is able to get the facts and points across in a clear and concise way. Additionally, he is great with providing other ways to explain the topic, and is kind when someone may have a question wrong. Also, he his reading quizzes are definitely easy!
What a great class. Information was well organized, lectures were interesting, expectations were always clear. Polling in class was especially helpful because many misconceptions could be corrected right away. There was a lot of information to digest, but it worked because each piece was gone over multiple times, and help was always available.
By far my FAVORITE professor! He is an expert in his field, and really knows what he's talking about. Bio is not easy, but Freeman makes it interesting and doable- an added bonus that the class uses a textbook written by him, so his lectures go along with it perfectly. If you have the chance, TAKE HIS CLASS!
Lots of higher order thinking questions on exams, memorizing the textbook will NOT help you in this course. Get ready to read!! Very nice and accessible outside of class. Low tolerance for "stupid" question, ie the examples already discussed in class or lab. Overall, he is so awesome. 10/10 recommend!!
Do the homework, do the quizzes, do the study questions, and go to office hours. You'll be fine. Freeman shows a passion for teaching and the subject matter, which makes a huge difference. He encourages you to be proactive in your learning and community as well.
SUCH an amazing professor and made Intro Bio so easy to understand. Once you realize the contribution he's made to the field of Biology you understand how intelligent and inspiring this man is. He's really great at teaching and exams aren't that difficult. It's a weed-out class but it was enjoyable and interesting.
Great professor, makes a weed-out class actually fun. Go to office hours at least once a week, it makes a big difference when you're in a 500-person lecture.
BIOL 240 Intensive Introductory Biology: Human Health Emphasis It is 15 credits and all of intro biology in ONE 10 WEEK SUMMER QUARTER! It is not easy but doable. Freeman was one of three profs. His lectures were perfectly put together, his tests are at a very high level, but if you truly put in the work, follow the process you will do well.
He is amazing! So passionate and involved. He is my favorite professor at UW. Take his class and go to office hours!!!
Hard class, but Freeman is a nice and funny professor that genuinely seems to care about his students.
Freeman truly cares. He makes lectures interesting. Fave STEM prof at UW so far.
Dr. Freeman was one of the best teachers I've had at UW. He really cares about students and it shows in his lectures. He explains the material in great ways and always has examples to help. It's not an easy A class (obviously) but he really does make the material easier to understand versus other teachers. His office hours were super helpful too!
Lectures are so helpful and actually very interesting, time goes by fast. Always willing to help and very encouraging/motivational professor!
All I can say is heck yeah. My favorite science teacher ever, dr freeman is hilarious and inspirational, and he is also very obviously passionate about biology. That passion is easily transmitted to his students
The best professor at UW, in my opinion. He's caring, knowledgeable, and accessible. Go to office hours, volunteer in class, and make yourself stand out. The class is huge, and he's an important guy in the bio department. His lectures are perfect, and he has a passion that really makes the class exciting and gives you a sense of curiosity. Amazing!
I loved Dr. Freeman. He does a wonderful job of explaining topics and he is obviously very knowledgeable and excited about the subjects. You really do need to read if you want to do well on the exams. They aren't the same as the quizzes, simple memorization will not be enough to do well on the exam.
Dr. Freeman is the most engaging professor I've had at the UW. He has an intense passion for teaching and learning and you'll leave this class feeling that you've learned more thoroughly than any science class you've taken. He cares about students and their success, so attend office hours, they're amazing.
Enjoying the lecture and polling questions
Dr Freeman is pretty intimidating, since he wrote the textbook used in this class. But once you get to know him he is a really great guy and knows what he is talking about!

Teacher comments: 
HE GIVES NO PARTIAL CREDIT WHATSOEVER AVOID AT ALL COST I WILL HAVE TO RETAKE THIS CLASS NUT HOPEFULLY WITH A BETTER PROFESSOR STUDIED NON STOP SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE QUARTER JUST TO FAIL DROP IF POSSIBLE
Learned more in 1 quarter of college than in 1 year of calc in high school.
Really a nice teacher, you should not miss his class. Maybe hard, but it's really helpful and you can actually learn things. (Just go to lectures)
Koblitz is a nice guy but the worst teacher. He doesn't teach anything, he only uses lecture time to do examples of problems without actually teaching you the basic concepts or methods. I used to be good at math but was confused everyday in the class. I wasn't sure where to get help outside of class and did poorly on exams. This class tanked my gpa
He's awful. Didn't curve midterms that had an average of 48%. Gives negative points if you get something wrong on an exam. Just take it a different quarter, trust me.
Don't take his class, switch or wait for another quarter.
Gives T and F questions and all three exams. One wrong and you get -3, so basically with two questions wrong you get points off for the whole section
While the exams were actually okay once you got the hang of how he grabs topics for the exam, they made up a massive portion of your grade. Further, his lectures really tended to put me to sleep. His grading criteria is based on whether or not you get the correct answer throughout, i.e. if you missed a negative in part 1, you lost nearly all points
308 with Koblitz is the way to go. Two of my roommates took 308 at the same time as I, all with different teachers, and they really struggled with the proof-based tests. Koblitz just cares that you can solve it. If you go to lecture, it is very clear what Koblitz is excited about (what he will put on the tests), so the exams are predictable.
Brilliant guy. Doesn't know how to teach. Goes on long tangents during class. But when he is showing you something useful, he barely gives you enough time to write down what he's done. Also, his grading style is super harsh and inconsistent. Average for the first and second midterms was 65% and 48% respectively. Would not recommend
this class was 2ez
Dr. Koblitz doesn't mess around, especially with humor or making lectures interesting. He is one of the more challenging 124 profs and you will receive quiz and midterm 1 scores that you are not fond of but the learning curve is high. He will answer any questions promptly with enough of a proof to clear things up. He knows what he is doing.
He did not even make a website for his class. made students use the general math website for UW. steer clear.
Sometimes the content of the class goes irrelevant with the content that I intended to learn
Literally some old bum that was on some other stuff literally just talked all the time, horrible explaining, not that much help, gave horrible quizzes and homework that many struggled with
He's actually a really great professor, I would take him again, everyone who complains just didn't try and are petty leaving mean comments, this is a math class you have to put in effort.
I attended Professor Koblitz's office hours and it was really helpful. His review lectures are basically what he put in the exams. There are weekly quizzes and they have the big impact on your grades. He does not allow calculators for his exams except the final, which means you know you did your math wrong if you don't get nice, simplified answers.
Professor Koblitz gives hard tests and quizzes, which are weekly. He is not very helpful after class, and seemed to help STAR students more than others. I do not recommend taking his class unless you are one of these students. He is inconsistent in grading tests in my opinion, and too smart to "dumb down" lectures for his freshman students.
Best Math professor I ever had. Lecture is clear and give enough examples. Really nice during both office hour and lecture time. Quickly explain and solve problems student gave. A lot of quiz, but will not destroy your grade.
He is tough grader and he probably is the have weekly quiz. However he makes sense so it is worthy to go to lectures.

Teacher comments: 
This class was so interesting and eye opening that I ended up switching my major to Public Health. Sparke is so engaging and knowledgable about the material. The class is alot of work but it teaches useful skills. If i could take this class every quarter, I think I'd still learn something new each time. He is a great contribution to GH.
I really respect and enjoy the passion that he gives in lectures. He's also super accommodating, and overall I appreciate his existence. However, I do have to say that sections feel like an absolute waste of time, workload is heavy, and as great as the speaker itself is, the lecture topics can be really boring and difficult to sit thru for 2 hrs!!!
Was just watching an online lecture for GH101 where Sparks says he looks at these sometimes and is usually depressed after. Made me sad because I love his lectures and he is super awesome!! Wanted to put in a good word becuase I had him for a globalization and global health course and he is amazing! Super smart and fun to listen to!
Best teacher at UW. Britain English accent. Cares about students. Clear PPT, final exam review are useful.
Very interesting topics. Made me wish I would've been a global health major. This class took a lot of time, but the material made me WANT to put the effort in. There are participation activities for each lecture, but you don't have to attend lecture to do the activities (on Canvas). Great guy who is always looking for feedback on his teaching.
I did not have an easy time with this class. Sparke is a great guy and wants his students to succeed, but assumes we have previous knowledge about global health concepts that many don't. There are a lot of complicated topics that aren't explained in the best ways.
Sparks is fantastic! He's got a great background and a ton of knowledge, which I think makes it hard for new students to follow his lectures (very high diction). But he's super accessible and seems to genuinely enjoy working with students and unpacking topics. Great professor and person to network with.
Eye opening but takes a lot of work.  The nearly 2 hour lecture format is challenging, that said, Sparke makes real effort to be engaging throughout. There is a major project which runs throughout the quarter that requires a huge amount of time and effort. If you have passion for global health, I strongly recommend!!
He is one of the most interesting, amazing professors I've ever had. He is engaging and has so much experience. It is an absolute honor to take a class from him.
Global Health 101 with professor Sparke was just amazing, I would recommend everyone to take this class as it opens your eyes up to the issues and from where the issues started relating to Global Health. He is really passionate about this topic and will help you in any way possible. One of the best professors I have had so far!
Prof Sparke gives well-planned lectures full of interesting and relevant course content which help in assignments a great deal. He puts in considerable effort to make the two hour long classes bearable by offering a short break mid-class and encouraging discussion and participation.  His  humor and use of videos/visuals also make class enjoyable.
Prof Sparke gives well planned lectures covering a wide range of interesting course content. Sparke makes effort to make the 2hr long classes bearable offering a short break mid-class and encouraging discussion and participation. You can tell he is passionate about the subject and I think he is the best lecturer of all of mine this quarter.
Pretty funny &amp; awesome professor. Makes a real effort to explain concepts to students. To succeed in GH101 be prepared to pay attention in class, read, complete assignments, and review info off the slides. The workload is manageable! Just do the work + readings, ask questions and you'll be fine :)
Professor Sparke is passionate about global health. He is very knowledgeable,  caring, and hilarious during the lecture. The two main parts of the course are the global fund project and the tests.  For global fund project, you need to do a small section each week, it does involve research. There will be study guides provided before tests.
This class wasn't what I expected coming into it, but I love doing the coursework and getting to know my TA and Professor Sparke. The lectures can be long, but that's to be expected with an hour and 50 minute class and Professor Sparke tries to make it more interactive.
The lectures may cause you to doze off, but it is crucial to listen and understand the material presented in them. Sparke does an amazing job of trying to keep the audience's attention, however, it can be a bit dry.  If you plan on taking this class show up to each and every lecture!
Very interesting topics covered. Readings may seem daunting but once you start you'll find yourself much more interested than you started out. Use a lot of cool videos as well to explain concepts.
Although this class does require a quite a bit of work for the final project, the quizzes are all online, untimed &amp; allow two attempts. There is one midterm and one final, which is all multiple choice. There's also a lot of reading. Even so, the material is really interesting and the professors do a great job of keeping it interesting! I Recommend!
Major bro. Learned so much and it is clear he is very knowledgeable about the material. Funny and interesting lectures.
Whoever wrote him a bad review needs to suck it up and read the book. If you read the book like you are told to and then his lectures really work off of that and it all makes a lot more sense. He is a fantastic professor with so much experience and really speaks with passion about the content of the class.

Teacher comments: 
Easy class and interesting lecturer. Go to class for poll everywhere. Free textbook is a plus. Tests are easy and lecture is clear. Lots of points available. Quiz section was kind of a waste of time. I recommend the Psych writing center for finalizing the research paper.
Dr. Culligan was very inspirational. Was there a lot of reading? Yes. Was the lectures long? Yes. Boring? No. Was she stunning? Absolutely.
Ann is very clear about what assignments are due and how they will be graded. She might come off a bit blunt, but is a great lecturer. I learned so much and appreciated the annotations she gave during her lectures. As a class, PSYCH257 is super interesting and a good choice for an elective. DO THE READINGS!
2 midterms 1 non-cumulative final. PollEv for participation pts (need right answer) and free txtbook for the class. Content is boring but prof is fun, and records lectures. 1 outside paper due in increments throughout qtr, relatively simple. Quiz sections actually help teach content.
Awful
This Professor is ridiculous.
Dr. Culligan is a super fun professor. She's energetic (even at 8:30 in the morning) and she seems to really care about what she's teaching. She teaches kinda fast and in classes with a lot of material (psych 202) it can be kinda hard to keep up, but in general, if you study a decent amount, it's doable. I recommend her if you love psych!
The hardest class I ever took was psych202. I got lucky to find a great study group after the first exam. Professor cares about her students learning and is available outside of class
She does talk fast, but it's hard to blame her because there's a lot of material to cover. If you attend lectures, take notes and pay attention, you won't have trouble scoring well. The way she does poll ev is kinda annoying though because she doesn't give warning for when she locks the poll. Overall not bad though
She makes subject matter interesting and tries to really engage with it. She sometimes overdoes certain topics, but overall knows what she is doing. it's easy to get a good grade if you try to but also easy to do bad if you skip class
Very energetic, sometimes to the point where she moves too fast to keep up. Good news is the lectures are recorded, so you can go over anything you miss. Make sure to have thick skin, she can be very condescending if you don't get every poll question correct. Be sure to show up, poll EV participation makes up a huge portion of the overall grade
The worst teacher I had in UW. She didn't prepare for the classes, no logic, just scattered aroud. Funny tones, speaking fast. DON'T TAKE HER CLASSES.
The only thing that really sticks out to me is that Dr. Culligan talks SO FAST. It's so hard to catch what she says because she doesn't even stop to take a breath. I would definitely recommend taking this class with a different professor.
I initially took this class because everyone told me it was an interesting, easy A. Don't get me wrong, it was an easy A, but I just don't think Psychology is my cup of tea; at least, not the way Culligan teaches it. She drags ON and ON and makes you despise the content SO MUCH that you get sick of it. I suggest you take it with someone else.
Dr. Culligan is an amazing professor! Her lectures were filled with examples and even guest lecturers to enhance your understanding of the material. Let's you keep exam questions so you can study for the final! :D
I LOVED this woman. I've rarely had a professor that I respected so much. She knows how to teach the material and is super excited to teach it to her students. She is a little over the top, but that just made the lectures interesting and dynamic. Highly recommend!
Assigned over 250 pages worth of articles in the last two weeks that were going to be on the final. Doesn't respond to students in regards to grades received. Lectures are virtually obsolete but you get forced to go because of poll questions. Leaves poll questions open for two seconds so be careful on your bathroom breaks
She's amazing, one of the funniest professor I've met. Her lectures can get a little dry but she tries her best to make it fun and worth while. A lot of reading and midterms, but it's all ok if you study hard.
Lectures always went longer than needed, was dismissive to student questions, and she never gave us an adequate amount of time to finish our poll everywhere questions IN CLASS.
She would miss class contents, whereas the tests would still cover that.
Teacher name: Bekyel, Ebru

Teacher comments: 
Hardest math exam I ever took because of her. Beware of the first midterm where you have to know your graphs so don't skip over them. I think the hardest part about her class is visualising 3D graphs so while reading the textbook, pay attention. Avoid this professor at all costs.
She isn't good
don't.
the 2.7-3.1 curve is easier to achieve than expected, if you get 87% or higher in all 3 exams and actually do your homework (never heard of anyone who does no homework with those exam grades) you will get 3.8-4.0.
I took the online class after taking &amp; doing well in Calc AB during high school, thinking it would be a breeze. Like everyone else has been saying, the lectures &amp; hw were easy enough, but the test questions were sickening. It doesn't really matter if you get the concepts because the tests will ruin you. Don't take this class.
I took the online class. the lectures were easy to understand. The home works were harder compared to the lectures but still doable but they won't prepare you for the exam as it is much harder than the content of the lectures and the assignments. Also I bought the text book but didn't even use it for the whole quarter.
She's not the most fantastic teacher I've ever had, but she's a pretty solid choice for mathematics. As long as you go to class, you should understand the context fine. Did not record lectures. Study for the weekly quizzes, don't buy the textbook, and pay attention to the test review days in class. Easiest class in the calc series.
explain stuff in great detail and always being inspiring
Ebru Bekyel was amazing. I didn't think I was smart enough to pass the calculus series but having a female professor really inspired me. Her tests are difficult but the answers always collapse nicely if you do the correct process. She obviously cares for students and makes great jokes in lecture. Be prepared to work hard but also to be impressed.
It took her 124 online class the first quarter of my college career and I was lost. Unfortunately, I have her again for 126. I couldn't change my schedule already when I realized it would be her teaching the class. She has made my life much harder than it should've been.
too many notes in the lecture, and she often messed up the calculation process. she even posted wrong solutions to the class, and her exams involve to many graphs. i hate graphs
I am so regretful to take her class, there are 6 friends of mine who are also in her section, all of us think she does not know how to teach. I don't want to be so negative, but it is so annoying that you can only understand maybe 20% of her lectures, and there are no recordings. By the way, her test is hardest and there are lots of graphs.
Definitely the worst Professor in 126. Her test only focuses on graphs, however, other instructors focus on different aspects and test students by real knowledge. Her lecture goes really fast, I think even the best students even don't know what's going on. Stupid test + lecture that can't understand  she.
Online is NOT a class to take unless you have a very good background in algebra. Major discrepancy between lectures, homework, and exams. Lectures would be easily-understandable, homework would require major thinking, then you look at the first question of a test and probably just want to cry in agony and reconsider your entire life. :) cheers
She made this class way harder than it needed to be you might be better off not showing up to lectures and teaching yourself because she over complicated simple ideas. The final was way harder than any of the old ones from the math archive and some of the questions we barely did any practice on or even went over.
There was an insane amount of homework each week and it didn't even help you prepare for the exams. The practice problems and midterm reviews were no help for the exams either. She gave exams where one version was extremely harder than the other. AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!
Worst professor Ive ever had. I try to remain fair when considering professors, but she showed absolutely no interest in student success and was very rude when asked simple questions. I got mad just sitting in class because her lectures were so disorganized and her homework never synced up to the sections we were learning.
She is super inflexible and apparently her tests are harder than the other math teachers'. The concepts learned in this class are actually pretty simple but she overcomplicates everything and makes it much harder than it needs to be. Also for the last midterm had one version that was significantly harder than the other. Would not recommend.
makes a class that could be an easy 4.0 into an incredibly stressful class. i hardly go to lecture because i'm better at teaching myself the concepts. ridiculous amount of assigned homeworks and tests are not comparable to other math 111 professor's tests (her's are remarkably harder). she also has literally no sympathy for her students. AVOID!!!!!
Ebru has some good jokes. But thats about it. If youre good at math naturally, you may actually succeed, but if youre not, youre gonna have to work extra hard. And maybe even that wont be enough. Exams across the sections vary in difficulty (which should be like.. illegal?) and she isnt straightforward. Avoid this teacher AT ALL costs.
Teacher name: Swanson, Terry
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Probably the nicest professor at UW. He will say "bless you" in the middle of a sentence if someone in the class sneezes, and he does it every single time. Also teaches very effectively. The class is easy to do well in if you look at past papers and review the red parts in the PowerPoints. I would suggest going to lecture, he's frankly awesome.
He is the best professor I have ever had. He cares very much about students, teaches very well and apart from the course content also makes sure students learn what science is all about. He genuinely is trying to make our generation better equipped for the future. The class is easy enough to pass if you do past papers and read all the powerpoints.
Amazing! Lots of extra credit, it's easy and field trips are fun and a great way to meet people. Don't have to go to lectures, but attend the tutorials he has once a week since they're extra credit and cover what you need to know. Labs are chill. For tests, study his examples because they're all basically the same; spent 2 hrs studying and aced it
He is the BEST!!! So caring and just awesome
The best professor at UW
Best i ever had
high key hard forreal, tests are full of trick questions
Terry is a great person in general, although he is so unclear while lecturing and his powerpoints are confusing as well. LOTS OF MEMORIZATION, difficult too. He blurts out information and expects you to understand it immediately. A lot of my peers are just as confused with the material as I am. He does give lots of EC though but not enough to pass
Worst teacher i've ever had in my life. He can't teach, he just blurts out information with barely any context, and uses so much jargon without explaining what it is. Only take this class if you are willing to spend hours stressing out trying to find out what he is saying 99% of the time. The only good thing is that he gives extra credit sometimes.
Terry is fantastic. He's a very animated, patient, effective lecturer who gives tons of extra credit opportunities. He's really passionate about teaching, super nice, and clearly knowledgeable about his field. Really funny too. Even if you don't come in with an interest in geology, ESS 101 will probably still be enjoyable thanks to Terry.
Terry is amazing &amp; you can tell that he is very passionate about the subject and cares about his students. But I wouldn't be fooled by those who say it is an easy 4.0 b/c I came in with that mentality only to find that the subject was very different from anything I had ever learned, the labs were long, &amp; there was a lot of memorization required.
class is not required except for labs once a week. lab is pretty easy if you have a good TA. Tests were kind of difficult, just study off of past exams and you should easily do above average on exam.
This class requires little effort and you can get an A as long as you remember all the test questions. I actually found this class interesting and enjoyed it. There are many extra credits!!!
Terry is THE MAN. He is possibly the nicest, most caring person I've ever met. He is so passionate about rocks it's ridiculous. The actual subject sucks but his energy made the class worth it. Easy class with a great guy. This class is a rite of passage for UW students.
Terry is by far one of the best professors to have at UW! Not only does he offer many extra credit opportunities, but he is also straightforward as to what to study for his tests! You will be pleasantly surprised in his class.
Terry is SUPER enthusiastic and actually cares so much about his students, calls us his kids super sweet! Labs can be tricky and it depends on what TA you have, whether youll be graded harshly or not. Lots of memorization for tests, since its all really details. Lots of extra credit offered, take advantage of that!
I studied for 5 hours for 3 days before exam and got over 90. Final only covers the materials from second half of the quarter. All multiple choice. You should collect the past exams as you can. Lab section, TA are helpful. Some say this class got harder than before, but I feel just little harder. Go to lecture for extra credit Q on exams.
First off: HE'S VERY LOUD! I was excited for this prof, but ended up being confused at the hype. He knows a lot but his class was set up badly, and I never learned my midterm score until after the class was over! The student presentations were a mess and his exams are multiple choice and on small details, not overall concepts.
Professor Terry is a great professor and the class isnt too hard. However it isnt as easy as everyone claims it will be. If you put in the effort to study for the midterm and final then you probably do pretty good. Even if you dont do so well on the tests, you can still pass with a pretty good grade because he gives a lot of extra credit
Terry gets very excited about the subject he's teaching. He has a very cute dog. He's a really stand up guy. He doesn't believe in buying textbooks because he is aware of the unfair prices in the textbook industries so he uses an open source textbook from Canada. You will find Terry to be more than a professor, but a friend.
Teacher name: Conroy, Matthew
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Conroy was terrible. The classes were confusing and he was condescending and rude at times when we did not speak up to answer questions. The homework is designed to take a really long time and the exams were graded very harshly. I regret having taken this class and should have waited to take it with a different professor.
This course was designed for you to utilize the Math Study Center due to the large workload and how ineffective his lectures were in learning the material. If you prefer studying alone, you may have a hard time with this course. This is especially true if you haven't taken a Precalculus course in high school or college before.
Really a hard grader, and the peer review is not fair for everyone, he just accepts it without any think
Very enthusiastic but sometimes the lectures don't really help with the hw
Hard grader, gives the toughest questions in exam, he clears doubts at office hours but the lectures are not well designed
He isnt the worst, but hes not good. He wrote the book he uses in class and it isnt a good one either. He goes over similar math problems as the homework, but you need to be there in class. He posts his notes online, but its hard to follow without seeing how he does them. I tried to learn from the book but its useless. Go to his office hours
Take this class at a CC and transfer it over. It's much easier and you'll learn more. He is very knowledgable but he can't teach.
Dropped the class within the first week, His explanations are good but he gives an example of a problem in lecture that has nothing to do with the homework. He was behind on topics every day, horrendous handwriting, doesn't post any of the work online for us to go back too, goes way too fast, speaks low too. Glad I dropped is all I got to say.
At first, this class was the most overwhelming lecture I had been to out of my 2 years. I was constantly stressed and didn't understand they way he lectured.  STICK WITH IT and do your homework.  GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS. He's very nice and so good 1 on 1.  He talks way slower and offers so much help.  Utilize him and all profs as a resource!!
Dr. Conroy's lectures are very boring and they are not helpful. Regarding office hours, he is often available, but he makes you feel really dumb most of the time. In lectures where we review for tests, he only starts each problem, but rarely walks through the entire thing which is frustrating. Don't take this class unless you have to have it.
Heavy and difficult homework load, but way easier tests. Only required to do 90% of the homework throughout the quarter. Very frequent and very helpful office hours. Responds quickly on the discussion board. Is more than willing to explain something multiple times. Getting good at this class becomes easier throughout the quarter, like any other.
The class uses the textbook written by him. He also has no idea how to teach a basic pre-calc class. I've learned more from Khan Academy in a day then I have from him in a quarter. The class consists of just going through the warm ups and then maybe a problem. His handwriting is illegible. Do yourself a favor and don't take his class.
The homeworks were graded with a fine tooth comb, but after the first couple, it wasn't too hard to get a good grade. Projects that we completed were not graded on how successful the results were, but rather the process of finding the results. I recommend having strong programming knowledge as it is necessary to do well in the class.
I find it a bit weird that all the negative reviews for Conroy have similar tone/voice and are for Math 120 -- something he hasn't taught in years... Sounds like a past student that still hasn't gotten over their failure... Anyway, Conroy is very good. If you doubt me, please check the official UW Course Evaluation Catalog - he averages very high.
He is the best professor at UW. His teaching is so clear because he doesn't teach. His HW assignments are so easy because the thing he does in class doesn't cover anything on the HW so khan academy, but he's so cool like omg. Also he has his own textbook which has 0 errors and his like the best choice he ever made. 10/10 would love to take again.
Extremely harsh grader.
Conroy is  least helpful professor I have ever met. When I asked him for some help he shrugged &amp;  said that many people don't pass his class the first time around &amp; I could just re-take it the next quarter. I also asked if I could set up a time to meet with him &amp; he ended agreeing to see 4 other students at the same time. Homework to hours complete
Great Professor. His homework is hard but he holds homework sessions every week. He is really strict for grading homework though. Test was fair. As long as go to every lecture and do all the homework and exam archive problems. You will be fine for the test. He is really helpful. The lecture is really clear. I would recommended him.
Tests are fair and lectures are clear, but homework gets difficult in the second half of the class. The only real problem I had was that his homework sessions (different from his office hours) were late. I commute so I could only make it to a handful of sessions. When I did go though, he was very helpful. Would definitely recommend him.
I don't know why Conroy has such low ratings. He's an awesome dude and will help you succeed if you work hard. That being said, the only way to succeed in the class is to go to OH every week and have him look over every one of your proofs for homework. Be patient and responsive to his feedback, and you will gain a lot from him.
Teacher name: Reges, Stuart
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I've really enjoyed Reges, he's funny, but most importantly very good at explaining the concepts we are learning. Even though CSE 143X is a fast course, he has made it possible to keep up by being very decisive in his lectures. He also tells you all the important things you need for the tests and homework. I haven't really had to read the textbook.
Reges is a very inspiring professor to learn from. Admittedly, I had him for a seminar class and not a 14x course, but he consistently blew our minds with new concepts. He's also a great guy to talk to overall as he's very down to earth despite his legendary status. Take the 143 honors seminar if you can - it will change your life.
Not to hard to get 3.5+ as you do a lot practiceit problems everyday that are related to whats gonna be on the test. Also make sure to practice every single type of question on the test and that you know how to do them. Tests aren't bad as long as you practice ALOT for everything. As for homework just make sure you read the specs carefully.
Getting a good grade is not too hard in this class. His tests are very straightforward and he often recycles a big portion of the questions that are on the test. One nice thing, when I took the class, 50 percent of the final points were questions from his archive. But if you want to do well in his class, you need to study everything on this tests
Reges' lectures were hands down the best lectures I took all my education career (and I'm currently a doctoral student so I had quite a bit) I'm glad he was the one who laid down my programming fundamentals. Very tough grader so my GPA did indeed took a hit but I never would have changed his course for anything else.
I know he is a famous professor and has a good reputation. But his lecture is not as good. A lot of distracting unnecessary analogies. Even Whitaker is better than him. Nice guy though.
Goes on lots of tangents. You will learn way more from your TA quiz sections than you will with Reges.
Extremely difficult class, grading is also very unforgiving, but actual lectures are high quality, if you pay attention you will understand the content. Textbook is totally not needed.
Basically, if your not going for CS or a major that requires CSE 142/3, don't take these classes cause they kill your GPA so fast. Reges was fine as a lecturer, he wrote the textbook so he knows his stuff, but to do well u need to ace hw and exams. To ace the exams I recommend practicing over and over again, it helped me get in the 90s every time.
Almost all the code Ive written for the hw works correctly but I keep losing style points. If I have a question regarding style, I just have to guess because the tas arent allowed to answer it. Stuart is a good lecturer but the way the class is organized is unfair and penalizes the student for style even though we cant get help for it
He is pretty pretentious, but he knows what he's talking about for sure.
Excellent lectures. Difficult to talk to outside of class. Only ever attended the first lecture. Panopto is awesome.
Stuart is a great lecturer and makes CS enjoyable, but his grading is very heavily style-based. He's also quite rude and intimidating in person which hindered me from asking questions personally. Exams are reasonable, and as long as you study the material thoroughly you should be fine.
very strict message board policy. cannot post too many, cannot ask concepts in textbooks/lectures, cannot ask general questions. my messages been deleted many times and received emails from Stuart several times. so be prepared to go to ipl.
Decent lecturer but a bit overrated in my opinion. Pretty rude and not very accessible too. Grading is mostly based on a series of arbitrary style deductions including things such as use of advanced concept as point deductions. I got a pretty good grade but truly believe the 14x series is poorly designed.
Was a very difficult prof even though I had taken previous java classes at a community college. And I thought the teachers at community college were bad until I met this guy and barely passed...
Great teacher and super based guy - in fact he used to be director of the libertarian party. If you're trying to get into CS you really need to get a high grade in this class. (142/143)
DO NOT SKIP THE DISCUSSION SESSION! That is where you will learn the most and if you don't go, don't expect to get a good grade in the class. Homework is purposefully confusing and if you need help, ask your TA in person (they aren't allowed to say much at the IPL). Stuart is rude and not very helpful. Tests and homework are A LOT harder than 142.
This is a HARD class. Stuart didn't fail to deliver in teaching the class; he's a funny and very interesting person which made lecture enjoyable. I think a few things about the course itself (which Stuart made) could be revamped though. For example, binary trees need to be introduced way earlier for any chance on getting good a final grade.
I've taken a lot of class at Uni but CSE 142 and 143 were the hardest of the bunch. Stuart doesn't want students to succeed as much as he wants them to fail and lose points. Even if your code works perfectly, you are going to lose around 4-5 points just for commenting and the so called "style".
Teacher name: Craig, Colleen
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Okay, the tea is that Professor Craig is the best. Only professor that has made me actually love chemistry. She makes it seem easy and explains everything in the best ways. There is weekly Aleks homework, 2 midterms, a final, and 6 lab reports I think. Go to her lectures, office hours, and ask her questions. She is so helpful and actually cares.
Dr. Craig is a fantastic professor who truly puts 110% of her effort towards her students. Throughout winter quarter, she regularly livestreamed office hours from home the weekend before the exam. She's also incredibly honest about exams and gives a detailed breakdown, and lectures are very engaging as well. Definitely worth taking a class with!
Criag is an amazing professor! Her tests are fair and manageable if you understand the practice study questions along with the quiz section problems. Her lectures are engaging and she honestly is just super great in and outside of class!
Craig is a caring and engaging professor. She provides examples in her slides and the tests are similar to the practice tests. If you want to succeed in her class you will need to go get additional help if you need it. Craig does have some pacing problems, so if you need a professor that sticks to a strict schedule there may be problems.
Dr. Craig is a great professor who really cares about the student and the content that she is laying out. I would highly recommend her courses. Mind you the work can be difficult, it is worth the effort put in to get the information out.
I hate chemistry, but Dr. Craig made it more enjoyable. I actually enjoyed her lectures, and her analogies helped me understand some of the more advanced concepts. Her tests contain trick questions, which make it hard for someone who already struggles with chemistry to do well on them.
Best CHEM142 lecturer. Pre-game lectures by reading Zumdahl and lesson notes before the lectures. She gives concept tests which help your understanding and are participation based. You could skip 1-2 lectures without penalty. She's funny as well, sometimes does experiments in class. With all said though, it's very hard to get a 4.0.
Gen chem series SUCKS, but Colleen made it better. She is great at providing alternate explanations for difficult concepts if you just aren't getting what the textbook/lecture says. She makes a notoriously intimidating subject/series approachable. If you have the option, take the whole gen chem series with her. She is the BEST!
Professor Craig has incredible command of information and good explanations for pretty much everything in general chemistry which made it easy for me to understand the content. Polleverywhere every lecture that counts toward your grade. Exams were fairly similar to the practice exams and weekly worksheets and not too difficult. Curved to a 2.7.
Chem 142 is hard, but I enjoyed taking the course with Dr. Craig. She made lectures very engaging and interesting, which I appreciated. Lectures aren't technically mandatory but she does participation-based PollEverywhere questions throughout each one so it's definitely beneficial to go.
She gives you points just for showing up to class and participating. Every class she does example problems and takes questions from students to clarify concepts AND she gets through all the content. For tests, she tells you specifically what concepts will or will not be included. She is a very reasonable teacher and she is also very funny.
For a lecture hall with 500+ students, Colleen handles it extremely welleven managing to throw in some good jokes here and there.
She's so funny and explains everything very well. Lectures are mandatory because participation counts. It is necessary to be very organized because this class requires a lot of work.
Shes a really respectable person who knows her stuff and has methods to help you learn. I took the easy way out and suffered for it. ALEKS helps more than you think. She helps with concepts but not with actual grades  that falls to the TAs. Her class wasnt the worst 700 person lecture out there for sure.
Dr. Craig knows what she is doing. Her tests are tricky and may make you cry immediately afterwards but she teaches the materially very clearly. Use the resources that she gives you and do all practice problems. Quizzes in 142 will stress you out but don't affect your grade that much. Amazing, engaging lecturer.
She's an okay teacher. Tests aren't too hard but she really knows how to trip people over. Didn't get the grade I wanted (3.5+) because of this. If I were to take this class I again, I would recommend timing yourself and doing questions from the textbook.
The best chem prof I had. She actually drops ur lowest grade and grades you on improvement, I did really bad below standard deviation on both exams and did really well on final and got 3.7. Her tricks are what she bolds in the tests, and make sure to read the textbook, it's conceptually easy to understand.
MOST DEFINITELY TAKE! ONE OF THE BEST CHEM TEACHERS AT UW
I had 142 and 152 with professor Craig, exams do have tricky questions but easy. Which means no matter you are smart or not, you can get 4.0 with no problem. Practice and practice. Her chemistry classes are the only classes I felt confident about. I felt supported and was given enough sources to study with. Best professor throughout my first year.
Dr. Craig's lectures were extremely helpful and clear. I think she highlighted everything that would be on the test well so there was no confusion about what she wanted us to learn. Also if something was not gone over in detail in class, it would most of the time not be on the test. She's also a very funny professor and keep the lecture hall awake.
Teacher name: Taggart, Jennifer
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I really enjoyed her lectures. She explained things well and the TA's also reinforced her topics. While I highly recommend her, don't expect to just nod off in the back of the class to do well. Sit in the front, take moderate notes and also just listen. Math is still tough and you'll have to work hard. Webassign can be annoying as usual but Chegg.
Dr. Taggart is an excellent professor. She clearly explains concepts, often in several ways. Shes willing to answer questions. Shes also passionate about her subject and very high energy and engaging. She does like to make you think on her tests, so dont expect to regurgitate information. Definitely one of the best Math 126 professors.
Professor Taggart is a really nice person. I think it's important to go to her office hours if you get stuck. She will help you as much as she can. Personally I think attending lectures are very helpful, even though her notes are uploaded online. For exams, make sure you do lots of practice exams in the archive and you are good to go!
Taggart's not the warmest person but she taught MATH 126 SO well. Attend class everyday; don't rely on the online notes shes posts because it's what she elaborates in lecture that really makes the difference. You don't need the textbook, the homework load is reasonable, and take advantage of the plethora of previous exams online.
Her lecture is good. But I have problems with the grading on this problem. In the test, it doesn't said you have to show your work, I got the right answer but I got 0/10 just because no work shown. For other problem, got 6/10 for algebra mistake, I asked for regrade, the grader took down points for the time wasted to regrade? WORST GRADER EVER!
A good prof, but really slow for the progress. Plz offer less trivial examples, and offer us the concepts quicker.
Dr. Taggart was amazing. Her lectures were fast-paced, but structured well, and she was always available after class and during study center for questions. She taught only the important parts and never assigned busy-work. Each of the hw was useful in preparing for exams. Final required lots of in-depth thinking. Go to study center!
She has amazing lectures and she gives example that gives clear information about the topics. She provides previous exams that show what she wants on the midterms. Watch out! The final is more in depth and much harder than the midterms, especially when you dont keep yourself healthy. The textbook would have helped with the depth of my knowledge.
Great lectures and lecture notes. Course is well designed and very fair. Webassign questions are often used on the exams so it's good to make sure you remember how to do all of the Webassign questions. If you make sure to attend every lecture, you'll do well.
Very passionate and energetic lecturer. Her lectures are fast-paced but clear and well-structured and she's good at answering questions. The homework can be tough but that's true of pretty much any STEM class at UW. The midterms were actually pretty easy as long as you put real effort into the homework, but the final was definitely harder.
Taggart is very enthusiastic about math and it really shows in her lectures. Test were much more harder than I expected, but it is UW after all. The other downside is that her shoes are sqeaky, but other than that she's great for math 126.
Dr. Taggart is a decent lecturer. If you are planning to take the class I highly recommend looking at her website and following her recommendations such as going over old midterms and finals leading up to the tests. Midterms are decently difficult, but expect the final to be even tougher.
She is funny and enthusiastic as well as being a great teacher. Yes homework sucks and tests aren't great but that is definitely true of any math course here. Her midterms are relatively easy but overall I felt that the class was fair and grades reflected the amount of work put in.
She is a pretty lecturer and also posts good notes on canvas. Her tests are very easy, something you may think is great but since the class is graded in a curve it might not help depending on the type of test taker you are. If you make silly mistakes it might seriously hurt your grade, the averages usually lie around 80%.
I had Dr. Taggart for math 126. She is very enthusiastic and seems to really care about what she's teaching. Lectures are fast-paced so be ready to take notes, best to put your phone away. As long as you follow along and do the homework the tests aren't that hard. Spend time on your notes sheet, make sure it has all the formulas you need.
Lectures are very important although the attendance is not compulsory. Very enthusiastic about the materials she is teaching and the explanation is succinct. Exams are neither too hard or too easy - prepare you well for the final but not too difficult if you really listen to her lectures and understand them.
In the points, vectors, and planes unit it's very hard to visualize what's going on but she did a great job explaining and showing concepts in lecture. She moved around a lot which will help keep you awake. Her voice is kind of annoying.
Dr. Taggart is an amazing lecturer. I've never been good at math but the way she explains it in class is so clear that I actually enjoy and understand what's going on. Your grade is 90% tests 10% homework though, so make sure to not screw up a midterm! 90% on homework automatically rounds up to 100%, so homework is the least of your worries.
Hard class, but she's very funny and explains concepts fairly well. Her tests are pretty tough, so be prepared to put forth your best effort to get a good grade.
She just loves math so much and its so apparent in her teaching. She's always really excited and willing to help you. Yeah, it's a hard class but its multi-variable calculus so thats to be expected
Teacher name: Passer, Michael
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Passer is a good lecturer, but this is a boring class . Lectures are dry, but pay attention because class material is fair game for the midterms and final. There is a lot of reading in this course; check the syllabus for when readings are due. Instructions for the homework assignments were very confusing and wordy.
Great professor. Funny, intelligent, and sensible. The class is very boring but he makes it tolerable. Tests are doable if you go to lecture and actually read the textbook (seriously, read the textbook). The homework is doable too but don't wait until last minute to finish it since it can make or break your grade. Would definitely take him again.
While the class content seems very basic and easy, the three tests (which compose most of your grade) are primarily on specific terms and definitions, making it way harder than necessary. The lectures are alright, and you can tell that Dr. Passer is pretty knowledgable, but several lectures are spent watching hour long videos that are not relevant.
His lectures were very predictable. Professor Passer delivered information very factually and stuck closely to the way the textbook presented information. It wasn't the most exciting but at least I knew that all the material was relevant for the tests.
Your entire grade depends on 3 tests. Test content is based on lecture material so you must attend class. Much harder than other psych 101 classes but enjoyable.
overall easy class, but lectures can be boring sometimes. It's good as long as you do the readings and keep up with lectures.
Passer is a funny, interesting professor which makes lectures good. Its important to go to class because tests are largely based on notes from lectures. Uses Pollev everyday which was a good tool to check what I knew. Overall, organized class, I knew what I had to do to get a good grade.
This class was the hardest 101 class I have ever taken in my life. The class is basically graded on three tests.
For 101 or 202, maybe Passer's a good professor but definitely not for 209. His lectures were boring as hell. Paper assignment did not have clear prompts and had to go to office hours every time. Can't promise that you'll get to meet him though because there's 10 other students also confused on what he expects for the paper.
Amazing lecture, helpful pollev, lecture notes are very important, make sure to read the book and have a general understanding of the experiments and their results
tests were easy, but hes really boring. hw assignments were where i lost the most points and those are graded by your TA. not a difficult class. pollev was easy bc you can read it from home and answer, but even if you did answer incorrectly, you get full points. just beware he only keeps polls open for 20sec
Excellent teacher, I thought it was a wonderful class. Make sure to do the readings and review the lecture, and do the extra credit, which gives your grade a 0.3+ boost. If you work moderately hard, it's not difficult to get an A. Exams are heavily based on the text, so read, make flashcards, memorize everything. Overall, an enjoyable experience.
Amazing guy. Makes class super interesting, but tests are really focuses on lecture and reading.
Poll ev necessary but it isn't graded of accuracy so you can do it from home. Lectures panopto recorded if you can't go to class. If you go 6 hours of extra credit studies your grade gets raised .3 which is a huge help. His lectures are EXTREMELY dry and boring and the curve is harsh but if you read and do most of the poll you should be fine
Really interesting and awesome lectures, gives you time to take notes before moving on. You can tell he's a seasoned lecturer. There isn't really homework, but don't skimp out on reading or studying. Pretty much your entire grade depends on the three tests in the quarter. Do the extra credit, but sign up early! It's really easy. It saved my butt!
You really can't skip lectures when it comes to this class, he gives a lot of examples that are helpful if you don't get the ones in the book. Very reading heavy, be sure to follow his schedule so you don't lag behind. Attending the chapter reviews that are given by your TA before exams will really save your grade.
Interesting professor and topics of discussion -- primarily given in power points. This is a class where you actually do need to read all of the assigned text. If you pay attention and lecture and study vocabulary terms you should be fine.
You don't need to do the homework. There are lot's of readings you have to read if you want to get a good grade on the exam. 0.3 extra credit on your GPA if you did. Tricky exam! Very tricky! Whatever, this professor is a good man. But, lot's of readings you have to read!
amazing professor. easy to understand lecture slides, panopto accessible, interesting topics (made more interesting by him), and clearly stated expectations. seems like an all-around, genuinely great human.
You really need to do a lot of readings if you would like to get a high grade in his tricky exams.
Teacher name: McDermott, Lois
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Grades are based on a number of assignments leading up to one big paper and presentation. Do not procrastinate! The workload is only heavy if you try to complete the entire paper in the days before it's due. It's an easy A but her expectations are confusing. Do not expect a rubric or clear guidelines on how to write the paper or present.
If you are not afraid of lectures that openly discuss sex in detail, you will enjoy. Some of the concepts are boring or "to be expected", while others are fun and inspirational. Exams have very specific questions but the curve is manageable. I did well on the first 2 midterms, bombed the third and got a perfect score, not including extra credit.
It's like a sex ed class, but it's a lot of stuff that isn't taught in standard sex ed classes in public schools, so it's worthwhile. She doesn't hold office hours and will refer you to the TAs for help. I got a 4.0, but I studied for weeks before each exam and the questions were super nit-picky. If you're a memorizercrammer, then you'll be fine.
One of the most entertaining and interesting professors I've ever had. I took Psych 210 as a diversity requirement, and even though I usually am not a big fan of two hour classes, she makes class super interesting and it's never boring. The tests are pretty specific, but all the info you'll need is in the lecture outline textbook (written by her!)
Lectures are so boring, but you have to go for clicker points. Tests aren't bad as long as you review the lecture outlines and read the book. You just have to memorize the smallest details which is kind of tough. Do the extra credit, cause without it you won't be getting over a 3.5
She was really nice and definitely passionate about the material, but her wording was overly complex sometimes and sometimes confusing. She was funny at times though, but the lectures were so long and everything she was saying was in her book for class; practically word for word.
I thought this class was going to  teach me about psychology stuff, however I was wrong. This class was more like a sex education class. The lectures were super long and dry, you won't get a lot of help from the professors because she always referred you to her TAs for questions and et cetera. No finals and you can retake her exams once.
DO NOT take this class! It is all based on memorizing useless statistics and trivial facts. Lectures are long and boring, and tests focus not on concepts, but on very specific details. This class was absolutely useless.
Amazing professor. She is brutally honest about her content (Human Sexuality) as well as hilarious and provides a great environment for education.
Lois is super laid back and awesome. The test are pretty tough though.
One of the most interesting classes, but exams can be a little toughconfusing. Attendance is mandatory (have to answer personal survey questions with a clicker each class) but lectures are usually pretty fun. Sometimes you'll have to watch old sex vids and a panel will come in to talk to the class. You learn A LOT about sex that you never knew.
Don't take this class. Killed my GPA, tests are hard, class is boring. All about memorizing random facts
She is a very entertaining professor, really knows what she is talking about. McDermott uses clickers EVERY class, there is usually 5 or so questions, make sure you go. Exams are detailed and I found that I should have studied at LEAST 2 full days. Fridays are either movies or guest lectures without clicker participation, super interesting!!
McDermott has a tendency to ramble on a bit sometimes, but the class is very simple: understand the terms in her lecture outline and you'll pass the class. You also have the ability to get extra credit very easily.
Didn't realize how well she was able to keep our attention on relatively boring topics until she had her TA teach for a week. Tests are pretty straightforward and as long as you memorize basically everything in her Lecture and Study Guide book, you'll do fine--never even touched the other textbook. Definitely do all the extra credit.
The class is really awful. She is one of the worst professors ever... the class should be taught to a smaller group. The way she teaches...
Professor McDermott always knows her topics and she is happy to help students if they ask for it.  Her lectures are jam-packed with information, and it's sometimes difficult to memorize all the information.
overall pretty easy. clickers for participation, 3 non cumulative midterms, shows cool videos and demonstrations during class and she's funny. extra credit
Probably the easiest Psych 101 professor! Got 3.9 studying a bit on exam week, sleeping through every single lecture, and doing the extra credit. Don't even bother with Passer's textbook. All I did was read and memorize a different lecture book she makes you buy and that's all you needed really. Very boring professor but not a bad teacher at all!
I am a psychology major and found this class useless. Her teaching style would indicate that she isn't actually a psychologist, the class is purely based on superficial memorization. Nothing sticks after the class. Her lectures are boring and painful, tests are RIDICULOUS. The questions are detail oriented and do not address overall understanding
Teacher name: Salehi-Esfahani, Haideh
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I honestly really liked Haideh. Lectures arent boring and she explains things well. Office hours help a lot too with topics you are confused on, as she will take the time to help you understand. Her tests were a little rushed but reasonable content, same with quizzes and HW.
Legit the worse class at UW. Heideh is fine, it's just that if your TA is trash, your whole grade is screwed. My TA refused to hear my explanations and only grade WORD FOR WORD from the answer key. Quizzes are only 20% while Exams are 60%. They don't give enough time for exams at all, so even if you know the material, your grade will prob suck
Ok honestly Haideh is super caring and nice and tries to help you understand the material as much as she can. Obviously Econ is going to be a hard class so don't expect to go in not trying at all and getting a good grade. As long as you go to office hours and genuinely try to learn the material, you should be fine.
oh my god make my quarter 1 full of sadness
Great lectures, and super helpful if you go to her office hours with questions. She uses specific examples that are easy to remember which is a lifesaver when it comes to remembering material for the tests.
At first, Haidehs class was very frustrating. The ARQs are stressful, and she is certainly a hard grader. Shes pretty predictable after a while. Read the book and understand the examples. The majority of her quizzes/exams are similar to questions from the book and her PREVIOUS EXAMS. Do all her practice questions and seek extra materials
Even you think you know the materials really well, you still cannot get a good grade on your tests.
TAs for the course are incredibly unhelpful and overall have no interest in helping you learn the lecture material. The quizzes and tests are then proceeded to be graded word for word to the answer key that she creates. You end up getting docked even if you completely understand the material. Don't waste your time with her as a professor!
Haideh isn't a bad person, at least that I noticed, but her class is unnecessarily hard. It's the kind of class that makes you feel horrible about yourself when you walk out. There's also 5 (maybe 6?) quizzes, two exams, homework every week, and in-class participation. She isn't evil or anything but she grades waaaay too hard in a hard field.
Really tough grader, have to be very specific.
Professor was fine. Assigned lots of reading, almost no homework. The problem is she clearly does not care who her TA's are. My TA spoke very little English and was very rude when I asked simple questions. Grading is ridiculous. If you get the right answers but explanation is not matched up exactly with the rubric, expect to do poorly.
The test is too heavy. This class is too hard. I think I will take again this class, but I would not choose this professor.
Although she is a great lecturer and makes you understand her lessons and concept very well, her quizes are unnecessary hard. She needs to make the instructions MUCH clearer because there would be times you would get points subtracted for an explanation for a very niche thing. If she wanted more details in the answer she should specify it.
This course, per department policy, is a zero-sum game - the average must be set between 2.8-3.1 within every section. Lectures are consistent, if boring, and attendance is required with proprietary digital clicker questions graded by accuracy. This is a challenging course, but Haideh is very caring and helpful in Office Hours. TAs can be hit/miss.
Trash. Getting a 73% on a quiz where I got EVERY ANSWER RIGHT. Pray that you can take your prereqs with someone better. Decent lectures, but will screw you over with no recourse. I will be submitting a bad course eval too. Best of luck.
TOUGH grader. Pray for a good TA and be as clear as you possibly can on her quizzes/tests, otherwise say goodbye to points. Unfortunately had her earliest lecture so I was a little out of it, but she's an engaging professor and has interesting stories applying to the concepts. Clicker questions were frustrating sometimes; read the Q+A's carefully!
Just going to reiterate that she's a tough grader. Lectures and hw are easy to follow but her multiple choice questions are quite difficult, nothing at all like the homework. She provides a LOT of practice material and is very accessible, so take advantage of these resources. She tells interesting stories as well and makes lecture enjoyable.
Haideh grades really specifically and her exams are so subjective it's difficult to do well. The curve this quarter was helpful, however we only received a curve because there were a lot of low scores on our final exam. I fell asleep multiple times in her lecture because of the long tangents she would go on with no seeming relation to economics.
If your goal is to learn something, she is a great professor. She does a very good job explaining concepts, and she is always there if you need help. However, if your goal is to bring your GPA up, she is the worst professor. Her tests are mostly multiple choice questions, and the choices for each questions are unclear and sometimes arguable.
She is a FAIR grader, not a tough grader. She may test you on something that stretches your thinking, but never tests you on something she never taught. As long as you do the assignments and the readings, there is no way you will get anything below 3.5. If you got a bad grade, you should blame yourself, or your TA if you are taking ECON 200.
Teacher name: Carroll, Andrea
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
WORST PROFESSOR I'VE HAD IN ALL MY GEN CHEM SERIES, AVOID AT ALL COST!!
Her exams are tough. Your best bet would be to understand the practice and textbook problems well. There is always a time crunch on the exams.
Dr. Carroll was a really good lecturer; she took the time to answer student questions and taught way better than just the textbook alone. Her tests are hard though, so be forewarned. You absolutely should read the textbook, do the HW, and do the additional practice problems. I did worse in 162 than 152, but that was because the material was harder.
Dr Carroll is my favorite chem prof. That includes over Craig or Li. She can come off as not caring but when you go to office hours she is very approachable and helpful. In office hours she would give hints on exams and more clarification. Her directions were very clear and i would have a worse grade if I didnt take her. But you have to WORK HARD.
Professor Carroll is great at teaching CHEM 162 and her lectures are interesting enough to keep you engaged. No past exams are provided, so you are expected to do the book problems in order to study and do well on the tests. I'd highly recommend looking for past exams though. Overall, attend lectures and do the homework and you should do fine.
Honestly CHEM 162 just sucks no matter which prof you will take. Carroll however, does not give any review material except for book problems so I was left asking my friends for old exams and the other sections for practice material. Exams are much harder than material in lecture, but as long as you understand book problems you should be fine.
Andrea as a person is awesome, approachable, and funny. However, her class is hard. I did all of the ALEKS, most of the end of chapter problems, attended class, and read the textbook before lecture and still did not do well. The labs are longer and more complex than 142 and 152 and the TA's are tough graders on the labs.
Writes the exams with no time to actually take them. Some of the material she asks us she never went over in class but expects you to be an expert. Brushes off topics but asks about them in GREAT detail on the tests. She makes them with the intention of failing students. CURVES TO A 2.7! Missed class once and got a 9/10 on polls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Exams are awful, with barely any time to do them. Lecture is dull and dry. Gets mad at class for packing up, like we're elementary students. "Wait for the bell!" Ask her a question after class and she'll scoff at you. Classmates don't shut up during lecture so best just skip and watch Panopto. Terrible class, dull lectures, tough exams.
If you read the book before lecture, go to lectures, and do the practice problems she assigns in the book, you'll do well.
This class is a prep course for the chem sequence (CHEM142, CHEM152, CHEM162). Carroll taught the course well. She is brief, clear, and answers your questions. ALEKS, the readings, and the end of chapter problems are a huge part of this course and Carroll will remind you of their importance. You will have two midterms and a final. Study for them.
Use the textbook for practice problems - you don't need to read it. As a grader, she and her TA's are fairly tough - show ALL your work on calculation problems and label everything. (i.e. ApiR^2(3.14)(10cm)^2314cm^2 as opposed to ApiR^2314) As a person, she is very kind and approachable, so attend office hours as often as you can.
Her lectures are longwinded and the exams don't truly show what you know. If you decide to take her class make sure you do all your ALEKS otherwise you'll most likely fail.
Dr. Carroll was a great lecturer and was always very clear about what we would / would not need to focus on studying for exams. She published lists of exam topics at the start of the quarter. Do all of the assigned readings and all of the assigned practice problems and you will do well in the class. Overall very organized and good class.
Her classes are overwhelming and she's always in a rush because she wants to meet the course plan. Get ready to go through 30+ slides in 50 minutes and have 30 problems assigned per lecture. She assigns useless Aleks topics too. Oh, and if she doesn't have time for more slides in class, she WOULD post them online so you can go through them alone.
Her class was hard, I'm not gonna lie, but I would recommend her as a prof anyway.  She consistently covered exactly the material we were being tested on during lecture, she was engaging and fun, and she was very available for questions.
Good professor. Clear lectures. Seems like she has her stuff together, organized.
Great professor, very informative lectures. Tests are difficult and long, so make sure you practice doing problems for speed, not just accuracy.
Chem 110 is an extremely easy class, especially because it's credit/no credit. I got 100% on every exam and I felt that the tests were extremely fair. I had taken chemistry in high school and I never studied once for an exam. A lot of homework but it's super easy just a little time consuming!
Dr. Carroll is very well organized and she tells you clearly what is going to be on the midterms and final, no surprises. Read the textbook, go to lecture, do ALEKS, keep up on end of chapter questions, and go to her office hours. One complaint is that she goes a bit quick in her lectures. Other than that, great professor and manageable class.
Teacher name: Brown, Jonatho
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Don't be a whiny, annoying student who sighs and pouts through Brown's class if you know his reputation. People are overreacting. He's old-school, not too problematic anymore (he's more aware of his behavior and criticisms), and has average lectures. Sure he gets off track sometimes, but still finishes PowerPoints. Personally wasn't too engaged
Doesn't really bother answering any questions during lecture, but ridicules students and assumes they didn't read. Constantly trying to maintain this image of being a grump, even brags about it. Is pretty funny and teaches an interesting class, but really seems like he hates being there.
I loved this course and this professor. He gets a lot of flack for being too old school, but in all honestly, if you can't keep off of your phone or feel like you can stroll in late and disrupt those of us who enjoy learning, then you don't have the right to be in class. Brown is truly a well of knowledge and he makes the concepts quite relatable.
He is a truly knowledgeable and talented professor. He expects students to be respectful towards eachother and to him. He has an unfiltered sense of humor, but truly cares about his students. I have learned so much from Brown that I don't really care what my grade is. I 100% recommend taking any of his courses. He is fantastic.
Brown get a pretty bad reputation because of his "strict" rules. He doesn't allow you to be on your phone in class, he doesn't allow you to arrive late to tests or classes etc., all of which are pretty reasonable rules. The best prof I have had and would definitely take another class with him. Just be a respectful student and open to learning.
Prof Brown is highly neurotic and refers to himself as "Browner the downer". he says it is ironic that he teaches personality classes because his personality is terrible. Honestly, he is mean and unfortunate to listen to, but his class is not all that bad. 4 easy papers, 3 tests. The grade you get is what you get - no wiggle room.
I got a 2.0 in the class which wound up being the class average meaning majority of his students received a 2.0. I got almost 100% on all 4 papers and got average for every test. He doesn't curve his class so you get what you get. He clearly hates teaching and lets the class know that every lecture. He tries to trick you on exams.
Jonathan Brown is an amazing professor, love him XD
Dr. Brown is not a bad prof, but if you take him too seriously, you'll be miserable in the class. The grade consists of a weekly quiz, 3 papers, and 3 tests. There is no curve. You NEED to study and read the book if you want a good grade. Going to lecture is helpful, but not really necessary to understand the material as long as you read the book.
Lectures can be pretty entertaining, but Brown will spend most of his time telling you how stupid you are. Even if you don't wear Tom's and Lululemon it will probably get quite tiresome for you. He's pretty good for Social (345): uses his own textbook, read it and you'll do fine. Tests in this class were awful though: not challenging in a good way.
Most people dislike him but that's okay because he doesn't care. He's a good lecturer. He gives everyone an equally hard time but in some weird way he cares about how much you learn. Exams are very hard (largely due to his vocabulary). He doesn't check his tests for confusing or misleading questions so what you get is what you get.
If you take things too seriously, you will probably be offended by a lot of his comments/jokes but I personally think he is hilarious. He does not sugar coat anything and is straight forward. He literally notices EVERYTHING so do not text in class. As for his exams, I didn't find them too hard. You just have to actually try and READ THE BOOK.
Brown just leaves you in the wild to fend for yourself. He doesn't give assignments so know how to study. Do not be expecting an easy A. A lot of memorizing. He doesn't have office hours, only his TA's do.
I loved Brown's lectures (though he DOES call out students for yawning, sleeping, etc., which can be a turn off for some), but wasn't so crazy about his grading. Grade is based off of 3 tests; no curve. To pass, you have to study really, really hard, but even though I did so, I struggled immensely. Like Brown, but would pick a different professor.
The good: Brown is well organized and rarely has a lecture spill over to the next day. His presentations are very clear and he is explicit regarding what you do and don't need to know.  The bad: Tests are difficult and there is a lot of material.  The ugly: While he is not racist or sexist, he frequently and openly mocks students.
p good
One of the most miserable professors at the UW. Knows the material well, but takes pride in not communicating with his students. He's on tenure, so watch out.
Impossible to focus on the content of the course while he continually targets and harasses students during lecture. Adds nothing to the class, just really distracting. Just a mean guy who uses the course as an attempt to raise his (obviously very low) self esteem. Hard to get a good grade (class average is a 2.5) and not worth anyones time.
Anyone rating him as good are doing so out of relief for having a decent grade-which is a battle in itself. He is rude, condescending &amp; arrogant. Class was graded on 3 tests that are *not* curved. Your understanding means *nothing*, it's all memorization of little info. Even if you score above avg, there is that 75% chance it will ruin your GPA.
I've been through many upper-division classes in both the psych and bio and I can pretty confidently assert that Brown is not a good professor. His condescension and inane distaste for technology offsets his intellectual accumen to the point where learning from him is more of a task than a pleasure. The work is not the problem, it's the person.
Teacher name: Ellis, Greg
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Guys, just dont take a class from Professor Ellis. I took Econ 300 with him and he literally MISSED half of our lectures (just wasn't around), cancelled our midterm, gave out TWO homework sets, and overall just ghosted our class. If you are hoping to go far in Econ, avoid at all costs!
Worst prof Ive ever had. Doesnt care whether students actually learn. Always unprepared and doesnt remember what he has or has not taught yet. Uses a whiteboard which half the class cant see, cancelled 8 lectures, gave us no idea what would be on the final besides giving us 1 practice final. Hes just a mess. Awful.
He rarely shows up in class, so he didn't finish what we should learn. He has no idea of the where the class is at, and he needs to look at students notes to find out what he should teach. Clearly come with no preparation. TA section teaches most stuff, TA did much more work than him. His office hour is 7:15-8:15 am. No curve.
I don't think this Professor knows what he taught and what he didn't. Based on what he did this quarter, the content of final exam does not match his practiced exam and TA review session. He canceled too many class, even the last class before the final exam. So that we don't even know what the range of the final exam. Also, his class is boring.
Had Ellis for Econ 301 and 382. Easy professor if you keep these in mind: (1) do not miss lectures and write everything down (2) the practice exams contain 50% of the exam questions and everything is from lecture (3) T.A's are very helpful; don't bother asking Ellis for help (4) if friends have taken the course, ask for practice exams. Be Boundless
Greg Ellis is very clear with his lectures. He will usually tackle about 3 different types of problems per lecture, and tests you on exactly what he's writing on the board. He doesn't try to trick you with his exams: if you know how to do those problems, you'll do well in the class. You get notecards on exams as well (extremely helpful)!
I agree with the last few comments about clarity. Ellis is really smart--and his class isn't THAT hard if you know calculus--but I definitely got the feeling that he didn't want to be stuck in a room full of college kids. Not very nice during early morning office hours. The TAs were really pleasant and helpful, though!
If you attend lecture regularly and do the practice questions given this class is cake. Concepts are easy to grasp with basic understanding of calculus and there is not a huge depth of material covered overall.
I do not think Ellis is clear. Totally agree to the last person's comment. His lectures were boring. All he did was to copy formulas on the white board without explaining much. Most of the times you have to understand things by yourself and connect things you learnt together. But exams were easy. Make sure to do the practice exams. Find a good TA.
I have no clue why people on here think Ellis is "so clear." He really isn't. He just writes up a bunch of jumbled equations up on the board that you've never seen before and gets feisty when someone tries to ask a clarifying question.  Error-prone! You need to go to class and REALLY read the textbook to at least kind of understand the material.
Make sure you go to class, he does not provide lecture notes online. He is old fashioned in that he uses the white boards to teach everything and your grade is made up of 1 midterm (40% of grade), the final (50% of grade), and online homework (10%). Good lecturer and made it clear what to expect on the exams.
Not a very engaging professor, but he tries his best and is very straightforward with teaching concepts and what you have to know for the exams. That being said, there's also some catching up that has to be done on your own to truly master the concept cause his lectures can go rather fast. Grading is also quite lenient so it's not a bad class.
Ellis is the reason I considered majoring in econ. Yes, he is old-fashioned (you HAVE to go to class, he does everything on a white-board, no recorded classes, and textbook lecture-style), but he is so clear. He will always provide an example and slow down if you just raise your hand and ask. Great dry humor. Early office hours @7:30am. LOVE HIM!
Best professor I have ever had for economics. He is very intelligent on the subjects he talks about. Don't miss lectures. Make sure you take good notes. Do the practice exams you are given because they are extremely similar to the actual exams. Really easy to get a good grade if you just show up to class and pay attention. Absolutely loved him.
The biggest issue I had with this class was that Professor Ellis did not make lectures available online, and talked way too quickly to take good notes. On top of that, Ellis is not very engaging and I found it hard to pay attention.I learned most from completing the homework assignments on MyEconlab and doing the practice problems in the textbook.
Must attend all lectures; very hard to do well if you don't know the material shown in class. 1 assigned textbook is useless. 2nd textbook with select articles are all found online so no need to spend extra money on it. Practice tests and hw definitely help for test preparation. Lectures sometimes don't make sense and Ellis skips over explanations.
Ellis's Econ 200 is very hard. He go through a lot of materials very quickly for each class and we don't even have any time to process. He will never repeat anything unless being asked. Some points are really hard to understand but he talks really fast about them. Also lack of responsibility. Ends class almost 1 hour early every time.
The class and the subject is interesting to me, and Professor Ellis is very knowledgeable in the area of Economics. The lectures were very early in the morning and two hours long so a friend to talk to a little bit during class helps or coffee as well. His lectures weren't available outside of class so attendance is mandatory.
Oh man, the class period was long, surviving his lectures in the morning was difficult, and his office hours are so early. Though I would recommend him, because most of the stuff he covers is in the book as well, word-by-word. Most of the problem sets he gives are similar to his pop quizzes and exam questions. Having an awesome TA makes it easier.
Really enjoyed the subject matter, and I thought that Ellis did a good job of relating it in simple terms. I got essentially all I needed from lectures, but the textbook was helpful when I needed more details. His office hours are 7:30am, if that's too tough keep that in mind
Teacher name: Nichifor, Alexandra
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Professor Nichifor is an AMAZING teacher. She explains things in great detail, makes sure to go over every component in a concept, and is very organized. I have struggled with math for all of my past math classes but when I had her as a professor, I succeeded with a 3.7.
was in the middle of using piazza when i had to go write this review because at midnight on a monday she was responding to students questions where they took a picture of their work, and she would respond by annotating their picture of their work. She is so thorough and hardworking. Goes above and beyond. Good at explaining too.
Professor Nichifor was an amazing teacher. She was always willing to explain even basic concepts multiple times and was so cute when she shared her nerdy math jokes before class. She broke down tough concepts into easily understood bits, and all of her lectures were really understandable. She worked really hard to be accessible outside of class :)
Online class. Highly recommend, since you don't need to go to class, nor quiz section and can re-watch any lecture over again. Super beneficial for midterm/final prep. Tests are on easier side. Explains extremely well. Caring for students' success. Homework is long for every math class so either way. Take her. Best math teacher.
Amazing professor that's great at explaining concepts.
Overall she is a very caring professor, and even curved our class very generously. However, at least for math, she lacks in the fact that she hasn't taught MATH 126 alot so there aren't a lot of previous midterms you can study off of. Additionally, her midterms lie on the easier side, so if you make a small mistake it will hurt your score more.
Clearly explains content and I was in an online lecture so I could always go back to whatever concept I wanted to review. There are a lot of homework and worksheet problems due online, so just make sure you set aside some time each day to work on them. She gives you a pdf course schedule so just stick to that and you will be fine. Available for Q's
She is an incredible teacher considering the difficulty of the subject. The tests are difficult, but she makes them as clear as she can considering the math department's rules. Also I loved how she focused more on concept than algebra, with the tests not too algebra heavy. 10/10 would choose her again for calc 3
Strong lecturer, probably one of the best math lecturers for introductory calculus courses at the University of Washington. Super clear. Amazingly interactive and kind. Take her!
I think she is very nice. Math 126 has a lot of new and difficult concepts but she is so nice about explaining them. The most helpful thing for me was reading the textbook before the lecture so that it made a lot more sense. That made the lectures easier to understand. Also, there was a lot of online homework, which was difficult and time consuming
Lectures are really good, so tests are a bit on the tougher side. Very approachable.
I took math 125 online with Dr. Nichifor. She is definitely one of the best math profs at uw. She really cares that you know the material well and will never trick you on exams. This is not an "easy a" class but she will make the material very clear and you can master all topics with enough practice. Talk to her via piazza you won't regret it!
Super sweet and super organized. I guess you could skip class if you want, but don't. Her lectures are organized to allow you to succeed if you go to class, pay attention, follow along with the problems, and do the homework yourself. I did this, and a few of the practice exams before tests, and it was an easy 4.0.
she is good lecturer, very clear teacher because we do the lesson each single day; expect to do lots of homework problems out of textbook and the online hw
She taught taught math 125 well, but this class is just so unnecessarily hard. I took calculus in high school and went to multiple tutors for this class and I'm at a 2.3... She's very useful in office hours, but sometimes she was condescending to me but I got over it. She's funny and very nice, but I just had a horrible time with her tests and calc
Math 125 is a hard class, but I think that Nichifor is a pretty good choice for it. She does panopto so you can look back at lectures, but I found it easier to just attend. The homework is tough but fairly reasonable. The two midterms and final are weighted heavily at 80% all together and she does not drop and homework grades.
She's a really kind-hearted person, and her tests are super straightforward. In my honest opinion they're easier than the rest of the math department's. Go to her office hours! She basically helps you with everything there and is super approachable.
her tests are super easy, pay attention and stay on top of everything and you'll do well.
P. Nichifor made me like math, which I normally detest. She is so funny and kind. She cares that her students learn! Her lectures are very clear, and lecture notes are posted online. However, it is best to show up to class, because she goes through processes in a very clear manner, and you don't want to miss it. Past exams are useful for studying.
Very kind, tries to make math interesting, cares about students. She has lots of office hours.
Teacher name: Pedigo, Daryl
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Pedigo is the worst professor I've had at UW. The whole intro series is a mess to be frank. He makes relatively simple concepts much more complicated then they need to be. When he does do an example in lecture he rushes through and then gives like 5 clicker questions a class so you really do have to learn the material your own. Exam averages in 50s
Overall, I thought Professor Pedigo was a fine instructor for a difficult class. He kept lectures entertaining and the lectures supplemented the required readings. This is definitely a class that requires a lot of effort for a good grade. My primary complaints are that lectures were not well timed and relied too heavily on clicker questions.
Phy 121 is tough in generally but Pedigo made it hell for sure. Hardest class I've taken without a doubt. The test averages were ridiculously lower. i thought I was going to fail the class but the average GPA was over a 3.0 so I ended up with a average grade. Just glad I made it.
Be ready to teach yourself:)
Really tough grader. All the exams are hard. Think carefully before taking this class.
This is one of the only professors I have ever actually disliked. He was quite arrogant and rude when I tried talking with him. As others have already stated, most of the classes are clicker questions, so the class pretty much consists of self learning with challenging tests. Not an inspirational course, and a very poor use of one's time.
Took Physics 121 my first quarter at UW and this professor made it one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. His exams are extremely difficult and the exam averages are around 50%
He is a mediocre physics professor, he started the quarter strong with interactive lectures and worksheets but got worse as the quarter went on. He lectures assuming everyone has done the reading which results in a lot of people being lost. However, if you do the reading, his lectures and examples help a lot with understanding the material.
Pedigo is the type of person you would crack open a cold one with, but he isn't the type of person you want as a physics professor. Lectures weren't super helpful because most of the time is allocated to clickers and the course overall was disorganized.
Disrespectful, NO practices tests, unnecessarily difficult, and basically ONLY does learning catalytic all class. Do you want a good grade, heard 123 is easier? Yeeeah, not with Pedigo. Take with another teacher if you want to recover from 122 and actually learn a thing or two. 3, 2, 1, BOOM!
He's the hardest professor I've ever had. Lectures are okay but his exams were the worst. Exam questions were calculator heavy and his averages are typically 45-65%. I highly recommend taking ANY other professor other than Pedigo. Also, he pronounces KAI-netic energy.
Sorry No Pedigo again. He will not explain any calculations for you. Just give you the formula, and then boom you get the answer. How could you get the answer? We don't know
Daryl Pedigo is very passionate about physics. He would catch his breath during lecture because he couldn't stop talking about it but it's difficult to follow him if you don't already have the foundation that he has. If you want a decent grade from this class be prepared to learn from the textbook and attend lecture for the participation points.
He took major heat for not giving out practice exams, but I don't think he was trying to screw us over. He lectures are horribly planned, he always rushes at the end. Actually every lecture was like that. You would think a guy as smart as Pedigo would learn from his mistakes, but nope. 3..2..1... and BOOM!
I love his lecture. HE's a SUCH AMAZING PROFESSOR. HE makes everything so clear. As long as you go to lectures, he will make sure you pass the exams.
Speaks quietly, hates explaining, and gets annoyed when students ask questions. Test averages in his class are usually extremely low, because no one has much idea about what's going on. Doesn't provide good study material, and his lecture slides aren't very helpful. Study from the textbook and try to avoid him at all cost.
Still salty about Physics so came back to rate him after 1 year. Horrible class by itself but Pedigo does not make it any better.
I am simply traumatized by Darly Pedigo and physics. I think he is very enthusiastic and he seems very knowledgeable but his teaching sucks. It's difficult to hear him most of the times because his voice is so soft-spoken and he goes by slides so fast during lecture I thought they were gifs. Unless you already know all the material do not take
Would've rated him 4/5 but he says kinetic energy KYE-netic SO.
He is not very engaging, lectures feel rushed, and he expects you to learn the material from the textbook on your own. I'm torn on attendance because there were clicker questions but they were heavily curved and lectures were pointless overviews. Pulls questions for tests from the unassigned problems in the book so do those if you have time.
Teacher name: Pickrell, Jacqueline
School name: University of Washington
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I absolutely loved this professor. She was always available at office hours to discuss class topics, or other any aspect of psychology. She genuinely cares how well you do in the class, if you make an effort. There is opportunity for extra credit and few other assignments, but the tests make up a huge part of your grade.
grade weighs heavily on tests, but she is willing to help and offers extra credit. very kind and cares about you actually learning the info, can go to office hours and learn a lot/ talk about the best psychology based movies. she also refers you to other professors in UW who may help you or have classes you may enjoy. id ask her for a letter of rec
Dr. Pickrell is a great lecturer. She makes things clear to understand, drops some jokes here and there, and offers a ton of extra credit. Some test questions are from the book, so reading is expected, but the workload isn't too bad. Lectures are recorded, so attendance isn't mandatory. Easy A if you get all your work done!
This class was really easy and interesting. Sometimes she moved too fast through lectures, but that was honestly not a dealbreaker because the material wasn't really difficult. She gives a lot of random extra credit in lecture, especially on days where not many people show up.
The GOAT. Didn't read the textbook after the first test (there are 3 total) and still ended up with a 4.0. Too many free points to count. Just stay on top of the weekly assignments, take advantage of the extra credit opportunities and you'll be golden.
She adds 0.3 points to your gpa, and 5 in-class extra credit, 4 credits more if you do all hw. One paper (2-3pg) very easy, lowest is 14/15. She gives extra credit random so don't skip class. She adds at least 1-2 points to midterms if you prove her question is ambiguous. For exam, read textbook+Launchpad+old exam. Her lecture is fun, class engaged
Professor Spector is amazing! She is a great lecturer, and the stories she tells in class are so funny, genuine, and inspiring. She gives a ton of extra credit for showing up to class, and your GPA can be boosted up to 0.3% just by participating in the psych research pool. After taking her class, I now want to major in psychology!
She tries to make jokes and add some humor to her lectures so they're not as dry. She uses different examples to help certain topics stick in your head. Attendance isn't mandatory since she doesn't take attendance and there's panopto, but sometimes she gives extra credit just for showing up. Do every homework since there's only 200 total points.
Awesome lectures. Exams are not easy, but a lot of extra credits. Thanks for making me love psychology.
Fantastic speaker, clearly knowledgeable, and a very nice person. The content is rather broad and covers a wide variety of topics. After tests, if students can justify wrong answers she gives a few extra credit points. Also, if you go to class, she'll give ec every once in a while.
Dr. Spector was an amazing prof. She gives out an exorbitant amount of extra credit, all homework except for one small paper is participation based, and when tests had poorly worded questions, she gave everyone EC when we argued them. Her office hours help immensely and she always has a story to tell. Her lectures were riveting and I never skipped.
Professor Spector was a great Professor and lecturer, but coming to her office hours she wasnt as nice. If you miss a few points it can really affect your grade. Theres extra credit with the research pool, but good luck because theres many you cant even do
You can basically Panopto the lectures, and finish it in 30 minutes instead. She gives a lot of extra credit points (5-ish total) if you're in class, when there's a low turn out for that day. She uses tv shows examples to make content relevant. The pacing is a bit slow. Reading the textbook is highly recommended.
She does a really great job of explaining the general aspects of psychology, good lecture style, weirdly structured slideshows but overall great professor! She has a great sense of humor and truly cares for her students! Would definitely take again.
This class has been disappointing. As an intro class, she only covers general areas of psychology. However, since she covers so much, she hasnt fully researched and analyzed a lot of what she teaches. Many of her descriptions are wrong or weak, lacking important &amp; notable factors. Easy A . In-class extra cred. Tests are memorization, nothing more.
Pickrell is a great teacher and her tests are fairly easy. Attendance isn't mandatory, but sometimes she gives extra credit if you are there.
This class was fairly easy, however it's only graded on a few things so if you forget to do something, your grade could potentially go down from a 4.0 to a 3.3 really quickly. She gives a lot of extra credit though. If you show up to lecture, take notes and read the textbook you should have no problem getting a 3.5 or higher
Super interesting lectures, I'm not a psych major but this class was super cool, prof is very kind, tests are easy, good study guides as well. Would totally take again.
Her class is graded on the UW 4.0 scale - 192/200 points is a 4.0 but it drops quickly. Homework is very easy and is graded on completion, Can take 5 mins/week if you're lazy. Do all the extra credit! You can get up to a .3 grade boost. Tests require studying and they screwed me. I got 160/200 points in the class and got a 3.0 were/ ec.
Really amazing intro to psych. This class is just a survey of "all of psych", so it's breadth not depth. It is fairly easy, but don't let it get away from you. Beware the second midterm. DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT. And, most importantly, go to her office hours. She is so nice and will open doors for you in the psych department.
Teacher name: Brau, Jim
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Jim Brau is great. Overall I feel that the key in this class is its amazing organization and access to practice problems and solutions guides. It is organized so well that you could figure out the entire class and do well on the test just by working problems and reading the book.
Jim Brau is the MOST CARING TEACHER. He really cares about his students. He is a great teacher and he uploads a video of each class to Youtube. I always went to class and then when I was preparing for exams I would rewatch the classes online and do practice problems. Brau is inspiring. His class takes some work but he makes it doable.
I would definitely recommend this professor! His lectures are very entertaining and the class is very easy. He posts his lectures on YouTube, so don't bother going to class and instead watch the YouTube at double speed and skip the boring stuff liKe his "spiritual thoughts". Our third midterm 170+ people got 100%. Take it if you want an easy A!
At the first of the semester I thought I made a bad choice by choosing Bro. Brau. I did horrible on the first exam but luckily you get to drop 1 out of the 5 tests, excluding the final. I got used to his teaching, then Holmes subbed, and I decided I like Brau better. But holy crap dude, a little less pre-workout might be smart.
Dr. Brau is very inspirational, very helpful, and very caring. He has genuine interest in his students. The class is graded only on midterms and a final. Know everything that happens in every lecture, study the pre-exams, do practice problems, and memorize what you need to memorize. The class is very straightforward and well taught.
Take Finance 201 from Brau. Trust me. I had Holmes last semester and dropped his class due to the difficulty of his tests. Although your grade in Brau's class is entirely based on exams, half of each exam is based on things discussed in the class notes. I find his tests more doable. I got great score on all of his exams. Do have to put in the work.
Brau is the bomb. Funny. Caring. Energetic. I was scared for his class because your grade is based on 100% tests, but if you put in the work you get the grade you deserve. 10/10 would recommend.
Brau is a great professor. No funny business with this guy. If you watch(youtube)/go to the lectures, and take diligent notes, you can get an A. This guy isn't out to trick you. If you understand the formulas and concepts in lecture, you will get an A.
Only graded on tests and final exams. Has it's pros and cons but no busy work! Brau makes the topic of finance entertaining. In order to get a decent grade you need to read the textbook before class, pay attention in class (or watch the lecture online if you skipped), and do all the practice exams. The lab for me was not super useful.
I liked this class a lot! There's only 4 midterms and the final. Some students don't like this, but for me that meant no busy work and I could work at my own pace. You learn a lot of good skills. Pro. Brau is awesome and super funny (even at 8am). He sometimes doesn't explain things in a clear way (uses his own lingo). Gives good, fast feedback.
Taking Bro Brau's class will help you learn about the basics of Finance. You will also be inspired his professional development and spiritual thoughts. Get ready to study hard and look for every detail in preparation for his four tests and a final.
Jim makes this class strait forward and to the point. Study the lecture material, go to the TA lab, put in the time and you will get an A no problem. However, I did not enjoy Jim as a person. He was very opinionated, often derogatory about other business majors, and shared a lot of personal opinions about various topics as "spiritual thoughts".
Professor Brau is great, but very intense. If you can handle an intense, no nonsense, lecture, then you'll like him. You're grade is based off of 4 midterms and a final, which is kind of nice because then you don't have to worry about quizzes throughout the semester. Great professor, but sometimes shares hard opinions that can be offensive.
Awesome! I would recommend to anyone taking FIN 201 that they do so from him.
All lectures posted online. Finance is hard but Brau IS THE BEST. Gives spiritual thoughts halfway through class, to break it up a bit. If you have to take Fin 200 take it from him.
Brau is awesome, but the whole class is only tests. You have to push yourself to study and quiz yourself. Your learning is pretty much your own responsibility. He teaches VERY clearly and thoroughly, and the tests are super fair. But, youve gotta push yourself to do the learning part. 10/10 would recommend
Professor Brau is hands down the best professor I have ever had at BYU. He's a solid finance teacher who really knows his stuff. He teaches difficult material in a way that anyone can understand if they put forth effort. He not only prepares you for the exams, but also for life. Each day in class he taught valuable life lessons along with finance.
Favorite class this semester! I'm not a natural test taker (onlytests are graded)and the subjects we covered weren't intuitive, but I was given every opportunity to succeed. His lectures are thorough &amp; he gives enough practice problems to be confident in the material. The tests aren't difficult if you pay attention, do the reading, &amp; put in effort.
Brother Brau is an awesome guy. The class is tough and it takes work, but you can definitely succeed if you try. The grade is only from the 5 tests, but you can drop one midterm. Read the textbook, come to class (or watch the videos of class that are posted on youtube), do all the practice questions, and you can definitely succeed in his class.
Bro Brau teaches well. His class has fair expectations and a reasonable workload. He uses a ton of superlatives which can be a bit deterring but as long as you can get over that, he's a nice guy who knows his stuff and wants you to succeed.
Teacher name: Hill, Edwar
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great teacher, teaches concepts clearly. My wife and I took this class to understand finances better. However, He delved deeper than needed to in areas such as taxes and insurance. Much too much homework for the kind of class we were expecting.
Dr. Hill's class is a bright spot in my schedule and my day, he cares deeply about his subject and is so passionate. Four papers for the semester, grading varies a lot by TA but overall not bad. 5 quizzes from textbook reading for the year all from the book, midterm and final from lecture material. Lots of extra credit. Recommend to everyone!
Dr. Hill is a very knowledgeable professor. He also genuinely cares about his students. His lectures could be a bit dry at times, and you get iClicker participation points for going, but overall it's not too bad of a class. There are 4 papers throughout the semester, each about 6-8 pages long. There were also 5 reading quizzes based on textbook.
Dr. Hill is the best! He's like a cool grandpa that you enjoy listening to as they talk for an hour. I took his 160 class and his 260 class at the same time and loved the overlap, respect for students, excitement for learning, and clear teaching/grading. Lots of stories and application to my life.
Very interactive funny guy. Took this class for a general, and didn't find the lectures the most interesting. But if you do find SFL interesting I recommend taking classes from Dr Hill.
This class was a lot more fun than I thought it was going to be. There are 4 papers that are pretty easy, 5 reading quizzes, a midterm, final and a few easy homework assignments. I bought the book, but never read it and just used the quizlets previous students had made online to study for them and did just fine! He's spiritual and a great lecturer!
I absolutely love Professor Hill! His class is meaningful and applicable to life. It is evident that he cares about each of his students, and he is happy to help. You should expect quizzes, essays, and tests. He offers a good amount of extra credit. I 100% recommend you take from him!
In this class you'll learn helpful things that will benefit you and your family relationships. It is interesting and beneficial material. Dr. Hill gives good lectures and tells lots of personal stories which is nice. You will have to write a few long papers that are graded pretty tough if you don't follow APA format exactly.
He tells a lot of stories form his personal life in lecture. If you learn best that way then definitely sign up for his classes. I personally liked it and felt the material was more applicable because of this.
Off Topic Often
Not my favorite professor Ive had but he truly was amazing. Papers were relatively easy and straightforward, and a few quizzes over textbook material were easy as well. Exams were only over lecture material which was easy to study for.
Really sweet guy, good lectures, fun to listen to. lots of essays to write but they are pretty straightforward and repetitive. the tests cover a lot of material but are straightforward as well. i would recommend his class!!
Dr Hill was probably my favorite professor at BYU. He is funny, gives good lectures that include everything he is going to test, and has plenty of TAs that are willing to help. If you want to pass the class, just read the textbook and youll kill the tests. Attendance is pretty mandatory only in that he does iClicker questions! Great professor!
I really enjoyed this class and this professor. He used his own personal experiences to relate to the topic and that was very helpful. I would suggest taking it. I learned a lot for my future.
His class is very good. The thing I did not like was how many papers there were. There are four papers (APA format). I think it was just especially hard because I was also taking writing 150 at the same time so all of our papers were overlapping. And I dont like writing either. Lots of busy work- quizzes tests papers but its manageable.
Dr. Hill is an amazing professor and helped me to learn and apply a lot of things from his family processes class into my personal life. He is very inspirational and you can tell he has been teaching this class for awhile and knows what he is talking about. Not very difficult as a class and totally worth it to learn from Dr. Hill.
Dr. Hill is a caring individual who you can tell really cares about this class and the subject he is teaching. He spends a lot of time giving examples of things and goes according to the PP. Honestly though, if this class's attendance wasn't mandatory I probably would not have come. Don't take this as an easy A it's a good amount of work and time.
Dr. Hill is a great professor. He really cares about his students and teaching them how to be wise financial stewards. Lectures can be a bit dry, but he tells lots of personal stories that make it more interesting and seem more applicable. There is a little bit of busy work, but if you do it, it's an easy A. Use the study guides for tests!
I showed up everyday and did homework for other classes and got an A. Slides are posted online and tests are really straightforward. The assignments are reasonable and not very time consuming. Interesting topics that you revisit in other SFL classes.
Would take class again. Prof Hill is very knowledgeable and cares about his students. There are 4 papers and 1 mid-term. Loved his lectures and the class overall.

Teacher comments: 
I loved this class! Dr. Ogletree is fun and light-hearted, but also knows his stuff. He teaches true doctrine with the Spirit. His course is very well-organized and straight forward and it's really not hard to get a good grade in this class!
Dr. Ogletree very effectively conveys the material and is both knowledgable and inspirational, as well as funny. He will virtually bend over backward to help you out and make sure you get the grade you deserve. That being said, the class often felt rushed and resources were under-utilized to maximize the potential of the material. Class was REL 200
Brother Ogletree really knows what he is talking about and the lectures have good material. Everyday there is a reading quiz and an attendance quiz but they're easy and open book. The tests are rough because they are mostly exact quotations, but he does provide a study guide for each exam.
Really nice guy and tries to make lectures fun. Not that hard of assignments and prepares you for exams.
He's a great guy and really cares for his students. There are a few assignments in the class but he makes them really easy for you. He says just to skim the readings and do the tests at the start of the semester, so you can get all that done in a few solid hours of work. You self grade your semester assignment. The exams are harder though.
Professor Ogletree is an awesome guy. He is really funny and has a quirky sense of humor and personality that makes lectures really fun to attend. He knows a lot about the family and is great at teaching it. I hated his tests. They were 100 questions and sometimes vague. Other than that everything was great.
If you're gonna take Eternal Families, take it from Prof. Ogletree!! I looked forward to going to class! There is a quiz before class everyday based on some readings but it doesn't take much time and I honestly LOVED doing the quizzes. They were super interesting. He is a very engaging teacher and the lectures were fun and spiritually uplifting!
The professor was wonderful in his teaching style. I got so much out of lectures and discussions in class! However, his tests were always so weird! I would get so much out of lecture and then the test was always focussed on memorizing ridiculous quotes and specific words that were so ambiguous that it was impossible to study for them.
Professor Ogletree is a good professor. He's funny and his lectures are fun. The only criticism I have are his tests; they're pure memorization of quotes from apostles and prophets. Other than that the class is good, the workload is very small, there's only attendance quizzes and reading quizzes which are super easy.
Professor Ogletree is a very funny professor and seems to know his stuff. His lectures are interesting and a joy to listen to. My only problem with the class were the tests; they are very memorization heavy and don't really focus on knowing the concepts. If you want to pass, you really have to memorize notes and study guide.
Professor Ogletree is hilarious and it is very enjoyable to be in class. The assignments are clear and the class in general is not too hard. The test can be a little hard but he gives study guides and gives very flexible amounts of time to take the tests. They are all online as well.
Dr. Ogletree is a good dude. He straight up told us that he didn't want his class to be our hardest class. He does his best to make class engaging and fun. His readings packet is mostly GC talks so I didn't buy it and did just fine! My only complaint is that he consistently prepares waaaay too much material than can be covered in class.
Good Teacher and nice guy! I just felt that the class was a little too much busywork and random facts and not enough critical thinking and concept mastery. We were tested a lot on memorization and not enough on important concepts/skills.
Oh. My. Goodness. I can't say enough good things about Prof. Ogletree. Every lesson I was inspired and learned so much. My main piece of advice: Don't get behind on assignments or forget quizzes because the points are hard to get back.
Dr. Ogletree is very direct and wants his students to be successful. He gives students a lot of opportunities to earn extra credit and is very clear on the assignments that need to be done in class. You fill out a study guide online and if you study (memorize) those, you will do well on the tests. He also does attendance quizzes - so go to class!
Great professor! Absolutely loved having him, he's funny, it's clear what he grades on, he provides study guides for both exams and quizzes. The unit exams caught me off guard, so just make sure to study for them!
Brother Ogletree is pretty sassy, but it makes class interesting. I loved his lectures and all the reading was great. But the tests are pretty ridiculous. He gives very specific study guides, but a lot of the questions are obscure statistics about things that just don't really matter.
Brother Ogletree is great. Super awesome guy and gives very entertaining lectures. The work isn't very hard, just keep up with it. I enjoyed the class a lot! Take eternal families from him!
Easy Easy... just do the exam study guides
Definitely not my favorite professor at BYU. But, there really is a lot of good information and insight in his lectures. Be open to the spirit and you will learn a lot about yourself, dating, and marriage. The homework is super easy, but you have to go to class to get attendance points. overall I didn't mind the class and it is pretty easy.

Teacher comments: 
I loved Tammy! She seriously is on of the coolest professors I've had at BYU. Her lectures are amazing, full of some incredible stories. Some of the homework was a little tedious and the daily quizzes were actually really difficult but such a great class that is worth taking for sure!
This class should be required for all BYU students. Tammy is thoughtful, funny, and insightful. She is passionate about helping BYU students have healthy, happy, and successful marriages. This class is great for any relationship stage, from single to married because it teaches you how to find authenticity in your life. Amazing class!
This class is life changing no matter your relationship status. It's only about marriage life but about relationships with God, yourself and others. Online quizzes are specific, so do your readings. Not reading and missing class will only hurt you by missing out on amazing life lessons. Tammy is an amazing professor with so much passion for life.
Great class. The quizzes are way more specific and difficult than they need to be. The content of the class is really good and Tammy does a great job of presenting the information well.
Tammy is awesome! She really is passionate about what she teaches, and practices what she preaches. I would reccomend this class to all students, even if you aren't dating someone or getting married soon! It teaches so many beneficial things about relationships in general. She is so real and candid, which was really refreshing.
Tammy is a riot! She brings so much joy and excitement into each lecture. I am preparing for marriage currently and I learned so much from this class that have really helped me feel prepared for life. It is not just a focus on marriage prep but really life prep. You learn so much and she does it in such an engaging way!
Tammy is a great teacher who is passionate about helping students be successful in their lives. This class is designed to not only to provide information, but to change who you are. Most of her assignments are experiential. Come to class and read because the after-class quizzes can be very specific. I loved taking this class with my wife!
Tammy is an awesome professor! She really puts effort into preparing her lectures and making them interesting. I never left class bored or tired because she made it easy to engage in the material. The homework is easy. If you make it count I think it can be really beneficial. Definitely a class I would take again, no questions!
Tammy is amazing!! Hands down the best class I have ever had.
Tammy is a hoot! I originally took this class because my roommate said no matter your relationship status, it can help you! All of her lectures are inspiring and very applicable in all relationships, especially in dating and marriage. You have quizzes after each class period, but if you pay attention and do the reading, you will be fine!
First off this class is meant to develop your character in preparation for future relationships and I would have no one else teach me this then Tammy Hill. Tammy inspires you to change, sparks introspection and teaches difficult topics comfortably and boldly. I highly recommend the experience you gain from Tammy and her lectures.
This class was the most terrifying class I could take due to my own fears around relationships and marriage. I'm so glad I took it from Tammy. She has incredible real-world experience and is able to communicate that to students. I experienced a great deal of personal healing taking this class. The experiential learning assignments are great.
Tammy is a great teacher. Her whole purpose is to just help you be more prepared in the dating world and for your marriage. Over all I would suggest going to as many lectures as possible because you learn so much and they are really enjoyable lectures as well.
Tammy knows her stuff and knows how to make class fun; however, the content in this class seems like it would fit better into the curriculum of an eternal families class. I would say 1/3 of the content in this class is about things that actually helped me prepare for marriage and most of what Tammy teaches is opinion-based.
Tammy is an amazing teacher! She has a lot of great insight, and this class isn't only about preparing yourself for marriage but also becoming your best self. She is down to earth and realistic, her assignments are geared towards helping you in your future marriage and becoming better instead of testing you on meaningless things.
SFL 223 (Preparation for Marriage) was an amazing class. Tammy incorporates academic and religious sources in readings and really knows and cares what she's talking about. There's a bit of outside work (experiential assignments) that you do, but it's fun and gets you out of your comfort zone in a good way. Just be open to doing new things!
Tammy is an AMAZING professor. She is super down to earth and is eager to help her students succeed both in the class and in life. You won't want to skip class because the lectures are THAT good. I would recommend this class to anyone at BYU.
Tammy is an absolute gem! Her marriage prep class was amazing! She has an INCREDIBLE story which is so inspiring. Her lectures were so insightful and I learned so much. There are daily quizzes on the lectures and readings, as well as outside projects that you complete throughout the semester. Just stay on top of things and you'll do great! :)
I've taken various SFL classes, felt excited about this course, but was most disappointed with this. I remember Tammy responding to someone's sincere curiosity with, "why would you want to know that?" Can be condescending/rude. If you want to take a more practical class healthy sexuality may be better.
This class was incredible! I would recommend it in an instant to anyone, getting married or not. This class really challenges you to get out of your comfort zone and enjoy new things in life. If you want a class will actually change your life and make you a better person (more fun and more spiritually rounded) this is the class for you!
Teacher name: Kearl, Jim
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Genius of a professor, students that don't grasp the topics covered at the level of difficulty tested will try to dissuade you from the class. College is not meant to be like high school yet most of the kids complain because they no longer have an inflated 4.6 GPA after this class. Take it to learn from a man who is near the top of his field.
The tests are written the way Kearl thinks. If you understand how he thinks, you will do fine. If you struggle understanding his thought process, take it from someone else. My only real problem with Kearl was that he often dismissed students questions and his TA's (fall 2018) made fun of a few of the students who were just trying to learn.
Econ 110 is a hard class no matter who you take it from. Dr. Kearl makes it fun and exciting. I wouldn't recommend taking this class your freshman year like I did because I was definitely not ready for how hardcore the class is. But if you need to take this class, take it from Kearl. His students have the highest average GPA for Econ 110 classes
Professor Kearl's class is challenging is the most meaningful ways. The way university should be.
I took this class my first semester at BYU, but I took AP macro and micro in high school and did well those. Kearl requires an expensive textbook that you cant sell back with problems that take up to 4 hours and an essay each week. His tests are incredibly hard and dont use anything from lecture or homework. Its not impossible but very hard!
Kearl is amazing, but he teaches the class like it's 1970. He shows no effort to update the curriculum or his style of grading because he's got tenure and knows he can get away with whatever he wants until he decides to leave. The class will leave you talking in your daily life about economics, but you will not like your grade.
Great professor, interesting lectures, with many current and relevant examples. Takes questions in class. Grade is based on three exams, but homework is important , if you don't do it, you will fail for multiple reasons. Really respect the guy, even if he called me out for falling asleep once.
I don't know why he got such poor reviews. He's not always the nicest guy, but he gives fascinating lectures and really explains the material well. He's got plenty of TAs and recitations to attend if you need help. The tests can be difficult, but totally manageable. Do your work and you'll do fine.
Kearl is a great professor to take Econ 110 from if you are a good test taker. Homework is lengthy and can seem unnecessary, but it all helps you better understand the concepts, which is what the three tests focus on, and they are only due weekly. His lectures are super interesting, and he is good at giving real life examples of new topics.
Worst class Ive ever taken. Kearl is so prideful that almost every time a confused student asks a question he responds in a way that humiliates them in front of 400+ peers. My academic advisor told me this is the 2nd most failed BYU class. I spent more time on this class than ACC, MKTG and STAT combined yet still got my worst grade ever.
Loved the class. I was nervous at first, especially after reading some of these other reviews. However, I found each of Dr. Kearl's lectures very interesting--it really shaped my world view. The bad news: your entire grade is derived from 3 exams... so study hard! If you work hard enough, you can do well.
Lectures were super cool! Study and do the homework or you are in trouble lol. It's a lot of work but it's fun !!!!!!! i enjoyed myself but would not take it again. a lot of work.
The most unorganized, difficult course in the history of courses. No TA. No reviews. No study guides. Just you and your notes. Kearl tends to act like we all went to MIT/Harvard with him so it is difficult to get anything from the lectures. Your entire grade is based on the final, with penalties if your 15pg paper is "inadequate". DO NOT TAKE THIS
This has been the hardest class of my BYU experience so far. I was warned about the difficulty so I made sure to spend about 3-4 hours outside of class for every hour spent in lecture. If you put in enough time you will do fine! A great lecturer, just dont fall asleep or use your phone!
This class is insane. The entire grade is the final, even though there's lots of homework assignments and a 15-page paper. The final is totally ambiguous. I took 110 and 257 from him and loved it. This class, however, is the worst class I have ever taken. No feedback, no help, just thrown to the dogs. Don't take this class.
Kearl is an economics wizard and his lectures are fascinating. The course is not hard in terms of homework however your entire grade is based on 2 midterms and a final. If you don't naturally think like an economist this can be a very hard class.
Jim Kearl is the reason I am in Economics, he is an incredible lecturer and very open if you come to him with questions or genuinely need help. Find people to study with, and read the chapters in depth because if you don't you're completely screwed.
I still have nightmares about this class. Kearl does not give you what you need to succeed. The material is impossibly hard to learn, there is no TA, and Kearl doesn't make himself available to help. I'm in law school now, and this class did me no good. Even if you study corporate law, this class will do you no good. Avoid at all costs.
Great guy, super tough class, calls you out if you're asleep, the good stuff.
He was always full of energy; taking the class at 8 was rough but he's loud enough you couldn't fall asleep. I feel like I learned a ton from his class and it took a lot of work, but his tests were fair. He covered all the material and a lot of the reading he assigned was actually pretty interesting.

Teacher comments: 
Best professor. He will do anything to help you succeed in class. Although the guy is retired, he is still my favorite professor
Such a great Professor. He was easy but that doesn't mean I didn't learn anything. Helped me appreciate the BoM even more after returning from my mission. I honestly wish he wasn't retiring.
He is retired now, but was an amazing teacher. His lectures were entertaining and his expectations were always very clear. His class helped my testimony and knowledge of the gospel grow so much! I loved him!!
Brother Parker is a good choice for a religion teacher. He tells what you need to do and then all you have to do is do it. You have to read 5 days a week. The quizzes are harder than the midterms because they're closed book. You can get an A in this class if you want it. He is funny sometimes but the class is all lecture.
Professor Parker is a nice guy, but he's very opinionated and if you really want to do well on tests you need to write everything down in your scriptures - whether you agree with the doctrine or not. I disagree with him on a lot of doctrine, but if you do the reading and write everything in your margins (no sticky notes allowed), you'll do fine.
He's a great guy that has some great stories. Expect 30 min of work a night.
No matter what others have said. He teaches the truth. He teaches with the scriptures and words of prophets. He will show you things you had no idea about. He is amazing. If you do not like to work hard to feel the Spirit to the point that the veil around you will be so thin, take someone else. This was his last semester, and what a wonderful man!!
Brother Parker is so amazing!!! I took his class my first semester of my freshman year and I was so worried about the other ratings that were left. He requires a lot of study time each day and multiple quizzes, the great thing is that he is very straightforward on what he is expecting. He is so willing to work with you. I learned SO MUCH!!
Brother Parker is honestly one of my favorite religion professors at BYU. His packet is pretty large but the questions are fairly easy to answer. He makes really in depth study guides for the final, so as long as you fill it out and study it, you'll do well.
I took Bro Parker's class this summer and it was fun and interesting. It is my first semester at BYU and it was a good class to easily transition to college. He has a few papers but they aren't that much work if you stay on top of them. He does have you read every day but it isn't much work after a you get used to it. He is always willing to help.
I really enjoyed his classes. You need to put in the time to study and learn, but it is a strait forward class. He tells you exactly how to get a good grade and he is willing to help you succeed. I messed up a test horribly and he let me re-take it. Work with him if you are struggling and he will be help you understand &amp; prepare for future tests
Brother Parker has been the best religion teacher I have had at BYU. He gives a lot of his own opinions but also tied all the things we were reading about in the scriptures to what was going on in our own lives. He is straightforward about what he expects you to do. The course load is heavy but you have a deep knowledge of the doctrine afterwards.
This class was not good. Parker requires you to go to the testing center 6 times for quizzes, 3 times for exams. That's 9 trips to the testing center for one class. You're required to read daily for 30 minutes -- 5 days a week -- and track it in a journal. There's 2 short essays and extra readings. Attendance is mandatory.  Take from someone else.
Can't say enough how unimpressed I was by his lectures. He mingled his own opinions into the doctrine constantly. The class as a whole had a negative energy. He was dismissive and condescending towards students that earnestly brought up questions. Disappointed BYU would hire someone with such small minded views. His class doesn't foster growth.
Brother Parker is so incredibly sweet and really knows his stuff. He tells the greatest stories. He has you read 30 minutes of BoM every night and the book that you read with it is super valuable and insightful. He's been teaching for many years and is a great choice for this class.
He taught the philosophies of men mingled with scripture.
Bro Parker has a heavier work load than normal teachers. He uses a packet that he created. You read the chapter and answer questions in the packet. The packet is used for quizzes taken in the testing center. Very organized and straight forward, just a little more work. His exams weren't terribly hard. No papers or journals. He is a very good man!
Brother Parker is a nice guy, but the way he approaches religion classes leans heavily academically. I spend more time in this 2-credit class than any of my other classes. His massive packet he gives you for studying the tests is meticulous and it's hard to tell exactly what he's looking for on test questions. Just a busy class.
I really enjoyed this class. Professor Parker is a great teacher and really understood the criteria. Get ready for lots of dad jokes and puns. Probably my favorite religion class I have taken yet.
He doesn't teach the gospel, but his own personal opinion. He says things that are often wrong and contrary to church doctrine.
Teacher name: Merrill, Byron
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
The guy acts like he knows what he's talking about, but the class was more difficult than a religion class needs to be. He also made strange comments about women and taught a few false doctrine-type things when I took New Testament, which rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel like I wasn't learning from someone with any authority to teach me.
This was my third class from Bro Merrill, and I loved it! He is a great guy who really cares about his students. You have daily attendance quizzes (did you show up and pay attention), a few easy 1-page papers (completion), a few midterms, and the final. Honestly I wouldn't take this class from anyone else!
Really knows what he's talking about, but not great at structuring in a helpful way for learning, so classes were interesting but not really important. Tests have NOTHING to do with classes, and study guide is mediocre at best. Lots of reading but not necessary. If you don't do well on the tests, there's nothing you can do to improve your grade.
Brother Merrill is an awesome guy. You have to read the first half of the Book of Mormon in the first two weeks but that's the only demanding part. If you pay attention in class and go over the study guides before tests they are pretty easy. I will be taking BOM122 with him because of how simple his course structure is.
There's a lot of people that don't like Bro Merrill. I think it's because he chastises often. Personally, I really appreciate that about him though because he is very real with us; he isn't all rainbows and sunshine about the gospel. Tests were hard. Learned a lot from the class. Really enjoyed.
I love Bro Merrill! You really have to work for an A, but I learned so much from him. He is a caring teacher that really brings in the spirit during lecture. Pay attention, and you'll be fine!
Brother Merrill told the class on multiple occasions that we would be sent to Hell if we did not do what he asked of us. Did not appreciate being told that by a professor. The tests were based on what he felt was most important which was hard to tell based on his lectures. There were no lecture tools, only speaking at you.
A wonderful, spiritual lecturer, but doesn't have slides or anywhere to get notes besides coming to class every time. Very knowledgable and caring. There are only a couple of things that make or break your grade, so if you do the reading and study for the quizzes and tests, your grade will be alright. Papers are super easy points.
I loved the Lectures. I thought they were well presented and gave great insight. My problem was that the tests were set up in a way to trip you up. Although a great lecturer, He makes it very difficult to get a good grade in his class. For the amount of credits this class is, I feel like I had to spend far too much time in this class.
Brother Merrill is amazing! He knows more about the Book of Mormon than anyone I've ever met. He does talk really fast though, and doesn't have slides, so you kind of have to take notes on everything. Not a lot of homework; the hardest thing was reading the whole first half of the Book of Mormon in three weeks.
Brother Merrill loves the Book of Mormon a lot and it shows in his lectures. His lectures are based on the text itself and you are expected to study it often.
Brother Merrill is a nice man, but his tests are kind of ridiculous. You more or less have to have memorized the specific wording of hundreds of verses. His study guides are vague and the TAs are never available. Sometimes he says insensitive things and teaches non-official doctrine. If you test well, you'll be fine. If not, look somewhere else.
Brother Merrill's class was a breeze. Students complain that his tests are too specific, but they aren't that difficult, especially if you study. If you have a decent knowledge of the Book of Mormon you should be able to do well on every test. His lectures are definitely more focused on the spiritual side of things, not so much scholarly.
Brother Merrill's BOM class is amazing! However, the tests are very specific. There are lots of direct quotes, without references, and you are expected to know them. However, this is the most spiritual class I have ever taken. I would take his class for the spirit, not the grade.
I enjoyed this class! However, I would say this class is not for everyone. If you want an easy religion class, don't take from Brother Merrill. His tests are quite specific and can be difficult if you don't study. However, I loved his lectures and feel like I know the Book of Mormon so much better now! More like an old friend than just a book.
His lectures are ridiculously disorganized and he jumps around the text all the time. He has no slides so he's impossible to follow. He also skims through the info you need for the test and then talks about his personal life and politics. His tests do not reflect his lectures either and his study guides suck. Do not take from him.
This is one of my favorite religion classes I have ever taken, I left every class feeling uplifted and inspired. I was not very familiar with the subject before this class, and I felt like the RMs had a big advantage over me, but the tests were fair if you do the reading and follow the study guides.
Honestly, if you aren't an RM, this class is a bad idea. The lectures are inspiring and very informative, but don't relate to the tests in any useful way. The tests are brutal and don't match the study guides at all. However, if you are looking to really deepen your understanding of the Book of Mormon, Merrill is your guy
This was the worst experience I could have had with a religion class. The lectures are vague and scattered, the study guides for the tests are often inaccurate, and the tests are not well written. The test questions are always very specific, and many of them were never mentioned in class. Terrible class, please don't take a class from Bro. Merrill
Brother Merrill is a good teacher, and knows what he is talking about. However, his study guides are extremely vague and his tests are very hard. The average grade is never above a B on tests which in my opinion is ridiculous for a religion class.

Teacher comments: 
There are 2 worksheets and a paper required, which take some serious time, but the regular weekly assignments are not too bad. LOVE the lectures. Hes a fantastic teacher!
Great professor! I actually learned new stuff. He's very knowledgable about the scriptures and I definitely feel like I get more out of reading than I ever have.
Bro. Griffin is my favorite religion teacher I've taken a religion class from since being here! He provided amazing insights and really cared about us and our understanding of clear doctrine, and separated his opinions clearly. My testimony was strengthened immensely after this class, and he's passionate about our spiritual growth.
He talked incredibly fast and often went off on side-tangents during Book of Mormon lecture. Would not recommend. Find an easier religion teacher, because religion should be far more enjoyable than it was with Brother Griffin. Tests were open scripture (which in my opinion made it more difficult).
Brother Griffen made most classes interesting but when it came to the tests it was really hard to do well. The tests were pretty deceitful, all were multiple choice or matching, and every choice was something that we had been taught growing up. So if you are good at testing/religion take from him class was pretty good.
I really appreciated what I learned about the New Testament in this class. He is extremely knowledgeable and hates how we have to have tests. The final was harder than expected but he curved the class up anyway.
Professor Griffey was my favorite religion teacher Ive had because he is so passionate, relatable, sincere, and knowledgeable. He was pretty self conscious about his teaching skills, but I think he was an incredible teacher. Ive never met someone so knowledgeable of the scriptures, and his testimony of Christ was incredible.
Bro. Griffin was an AMAZING teacher for the New Testament! You can always tell he loves teaching from the scriptures, and he always gave historical context to give greater understanding. His tests are open scripture, and all assignments/papers have clear expectations, so it is not hard to do well in his class either.
Brother Griffin is so kind, thoughtful, and very sincere. He is knowledgable about many subjects and gave me a lot to think about in reference to things I know a lot about.
Weekly smart project, weekly quizzes. DO NOT MISS THE QUIZZES!! Open scripture tests, but still pretty time-consuming and a little challenging. Besides the grading aspect, I absolutely loved being in this class! Prof. Griffin has a good balanace between being spiritual and being entertaining. Loooots of puns! Absolutely loved going to class!
Lectures are repetitive, dogmatic, and borderline condescending. It felt like he required a certain level of spirituality to do well (mostly because of his TAs). He requires an obscene amount of "meaningful" time for HW. If you're already an incredibly spiritual person, you'll probably love him. If not, just take another prof. Can I get an amen?
If you don't like puns, don't take him. If you don't like amazing life-changing lessons about the Savior, don't take him. If hate having classes that you can get an A in, don't take him. Your grade is based on attendance, daily scripture study, a SMART project, and tests. AMAZING professor.
KNOWS his scriptures, knows how to give a good, insightful, and engaging lecture, and knows how to make you put time into growing your testimony. A couple papers, digital dialogues every week, quizzes every week - pretty good amount of work for a religion class but worth it. Tests are hard - study for them.
Griffin truly cares about his students and is very knowledgable. His tests are somewhat challenging but all other assignments are easy A's.
He really tried to give the highest grades he could justify. His lectures always contained new details and insights which kept them interesting. Griffin knows his stuff and really tries to make the class as easy as possible. I should mention that he loves puns and they're absolutely atrocious.
Brother Griffin knows his stuff. He is very knowledgeable about the context of the scriptures. He tries to relate it to your personal life. The classes weren't spiritual, some were, but he is constantly improving. No powerpoints just take good notes. You use scriptures on the tests so take good notes and make sure to put them in your scriptures.
So many people talked Brother Giffin up, and don't get me wrong, he is a great guy and a spiritual giant, but I was pretty let down by his class. Some days he was really hard to follow. He only talks during lecture, no slides to help guide. His tests are way hard, but good to learn from. Go to class and take really good notes to do well on tests.
I LOVED this class. Brother Griffin really knows what he's talking about. He's studied a lot about Jerusalem and the life of Christ, and is always encouraging us to connect with Heaven, so it does require some personal dedication. There's an hour of a personal project every week, and regular reading. Tests are open scripture, so write notes there.
He is an amazing teacher that really does his best to teach what the students need. He will take the time to answer questions. Tests were hard, make sure you have notes in your scriptures. Hard to know what he wants you to study. Work load wasn't bad at all and he is super open to helping and answering questions. Loved his class
If I were you I would definitely take this class. He understands that Religion classes should be spiritually enlarging and not the hardest class you take all semester. Every class was super interesting and as long as you show up to class you will get an A. He allows you to use your scriptures on tests so make sure you take good notes.
Teacher name: Knapp, Jill
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Sister Knapp was a really great teacher and her lectures were very interesting and informative. However, if you are taking this as an elective credit, there are WAY easier courses. This class requires a lot of reading and memorization, and I spent a lot of time preparing. Also, be careful on grading because the TA's are looking for specific points.
I really love Sister Knapp, and it is obvious that she loves what she does!!! I learned a lot about the world which I personally think is worth anyone's time. All the assignments and quizzes are pretty straightforward, and my only complaint would be that I feel the tests are harder than necessary.
Sister Knapp is an awesome teacher and I was baffled by how much she knew. Attendance is taken so show up and take good notes. Her tests are based off of what she teaches. It is very difficult to take the right notes and even harder to know how to best be prepared for her tests. No matter how much I knew the material I didn't do well on tests.
Great teacher. Fairly easy class. Just pay attention in class, stay on top of assignments, go to the reviews for the tests and you should be fine.
I really enjoyed This class, even though it did present a challenge for me. Sister Knapp presents geography in ways I had never learned before. Make sure to do your readings and study hard for the test.
hard class, be ready for lots of work. lots of busy work. tests can be more difficult than they need to be. class was for a general and now i am struggling so this class doesn't bring down my GPA.
She is a really kind person and wants to help. I feel like a lot of the stuff we talk about in class though we aren't tested on. we were tested on a lot of small detail kind of things. The tests are pretty hard but if you pay attention in class and do all your readings then you will be fine but it will take a lot of work.
Sister Knapp is a fun, bright and knowledgeable professor. Reading the textbook is recommended but I just went to her lectures and it was fine. There are quizzes about every week and sometimes there are countries you need to know that aren't on the quiz preparation tab. Tests are fine if you pay attention in class and take notes.
Jill Knapp's lectures are a good overview of each world region. It makes me want to dig deeper into each region. The syllabus is accurate and helpful and her online power points are handy for test reviews. I have enjoyed this class!
Tons of reading and you are graded in class for participation and answers to different questions. Professor knapp is a great teacher but there is a lot of material to cover. You have weekly map quizzes for every country and tests are a little bit difficult. Not an easy GE class but I learned so much about geography and the world.
There are frequent map quizzes, but these aren't discussed or mentioned in class until the moment of, so be careful. And she sometimes requires you to watch or read things that are marked as "extra credit". Reading is recommended, but if you just fill out study guides as you go and take good notes you should be fine. Her lectures are okay.
Sister Knapp is a great person! I have loved being in her classroom. She truly cares about each of her students. She makes it so easy to talk to her and work with her. She also really knows her stuff. Its amazing how much you can learn about the world in her class.
If you attend class, take notes, and do the reading you'll be fine. There are small quizzes each week but they are not too hard at all. Sister Knapp is a good teacher though and you can tell that she loves what she does.
Sister Knapp is a great professor and helps us to understand much of the material in the class. However, be on top of readings and map quizzes, since otherwise it can be easy to get behind. Also, class attendance is essential or it won't be easy to pass. Other than that, this class was enjoyable and it expanded my viewpoints on world interactions.
Sister Knapp is great with lectures and relating topics to each other. Work is required for sure, but if you attend and put in the time, you will do well.
This is a class you will look forward to attending every day. You have to attend each day to stay on top of the class, but the Jill Knapp and TA's are amazing so you really enjoy it. There is a lot of reading and A LOT of work involved in this class but it makes you understand the concepts and get rid of paradigms. I highly recommend this class!
Solid class. At times a little boring but she covers a lot of interesting subject matter.
Really great Professor. Not too bad of a class, but difficult if just getting into the feel of college. Loved the entire course and what it was about but it took so much of my time outside of class.
Professor Knapp was one of my favorite professors this semester. She is very passionate about what she's teaching and fair with her grading. What is required of you is always clear, and I feel like there's a lot of time of get what needs to be done, done.
Sister Knapp is just the most caring teacher here at BYU. She really is interested in helping the whole class out and she will drop everything to make sure that you understand the material. I highly recommend taking class from her.
Teacher name: Nelson, Larry
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I never opened the textbook and I was successful in his class because I attended all of them all! (His tests are based on his lectures: sit in the front, take good notes and enjoy!) Professor Nelson is amazingly smart and knowledgeable as well as kind. He explains hard concepts very clearly. I highly recommend taking this class from him!
Dr. Nelson is the BEST! I had him for SFL 200 (Eternal Family) and absolutely loved the class! I took human development from him last year and both classes were absolutely phenomenal! Eternal Family is a lot easier grade-wise and most of your grade comes from attendance and reading. His lectures are life-changing!
You cannot take Professor Nelson's class and not go to his lectures! He has amazing lectures that make you think and keep you engaged. You do want to prepare by doing the readings before the lecture so you can better understand what he talks about.
I love Larry Nelson. He is SUCH an incredible teacher if you put in your part. Beware that your grade is based only on 4 tests and 3 papers. They aren't very difficult, but he does not curve so you can't slack off. Start working on the papers a few weeks early. I didn't ever read the textbook except when doing study guides. I LOVE THIS CLASS.
Larry Nelson is incredible! His Human Development class was so enjoyable!! Lecture attendance is extremely important, but he is a great lecturer, you'll want to attend!
I absolutely loved this class. Professor Nelson is AMAZING. I left every class mind blown and inspired. I definitely plan on taking another class from him and 100% recommend taking his SFL 210 class. Our grades consisted of 3 papers and 4 exams. Make sure you take time on the papers and study for the exams and you will do just fine.
Larry gives amazing lectures and handles tough topics really well. He wants you to do well. I would take his class again. I was slightly disappointed by how vague the test review paper was in comparison to the actual test. Some of his TAs grade papers leniently and some will tank your grade for minor details. Take the papers seriously. Great class!
Dr. Nelson is without a doubt the best professor I've ever had at BYU. Take this class and you will not regret it! He handles even the most difficult subjects with compassion and openness. Don't be afraid of the extra credit hour, it doesn't add much work (I've had harder 2-credit religion classes) but adds a lot to the experience. TAKE THIS CLASS
I LOVE LARRY NELSON! No joke, this man is amazing and if you leave BYU without taking one of his classes, you have failed yourself. The material in this course is FASCINATING and applicable to everyone of every major. Such a strong spirit in this class; I cried about half of the time. Please please do yourself a favor and take this class!!
Dr. Nelson gets SO much hype, so I was really looking forward to taking his class. I was sadly let down. His tests make you APPLY what you learn, which was tricky for me. Take notes in class. TA's are really only helpful for the papers. They do not hold reviews before tests. Also the study guide he offers for tests are vague and leave you guessing.
This was my first semester at BYU so I'm a little biased when I say that Larry Nelson was the best professor I've had. There are a lot of readings for the class but I just followed the study guides when reading and it made it go faster. His lectures are PHENOMENAL! I think anyone who wants to be a parent one day should be required to take his class
Larry Nelson is AMAZING. His lectures are phenomenal; he is able to explain material in a hilarious yet clear way with many examples. He cares so deeply about what he is teaching and he loves all of his students. There are three papers (go to the TA paper reviews and you'll get an A pretty easily) and four tests (clear study guides) in the semester
Dr. Larry Nelson is amazing! His lectures are so interesting, and the material is really enjoyable. As long as you go to lectures and do readings, its an easy class. One of the best professors out there!!
Larry Nelson is an AMAZING professor. This course is a perfect workload and his assignments are made to enhance your understanding. He is so inspirational and teaches his class with such passion. He loves what he does and is so genuine and authentic. I am not exaggerating when I say it that changed my life Do everything you can to take this class.
He is a great teacher, if you are taking human development, he is your best option when selecting a professor.
I loved this class. Dr. Nelson is one of my favorite professors. His lectures were always inspiring and I learned so much over the course of the semester. I wish everyone was required to take a class from him.
Awesome
Larry Nelson is one of the loves of my life and his lectures are incredibly inspirational and edifying!! He conveys information clearly and is passionate about his work. He is honestly the best professor I've ever had - is really funny, extremely qualified, straightforward, spiritual, and a wonderful deep and critical thinker.
Oh my gosh. I LOVED PROFESSOR NELSON! People were in tears almost every class period because of how inspirational he is, he's sooo passionate about what he teaches. His study guides are very direct, so if you study, you can easily get an A in this class. I learned so much from him. Open to questions, very helpful.
IF YOU DO NOTHING ELSE AT BYU TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! Dr. Nelson is the greatest professor and human and his class is AMAZING!!! I never left class without feeling totally inspired and with a totally new and incredible perspective on life. Lots of reading, but you'll be ok if you just look at key words, etc. Use TAs for papers. Tests aren't too bad.
Teacher name: Bott, Randy
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I cannot possibly say enough about how much I love, admire and respect this man!!!
Brother Bott has quite the personality.  If you come to class and take good notes you should do fine.  I wasn't always sure how applicable to a mission what he taught was, but for the most part content was useful.  He likes to tell stories about himself and advertised various things throughout, but if you get past that it wasn't a bad class.
Its been ten years since i graduated, but i often think about the religious understanding i gained from Brother Randy Bott. I often find myself relating to his lessons, or explaning them to others. That's saying alot, ten years later.  He was by far the most influential and inspiring teacher of all my university studies. Thank you Brother Bott!
Loved Brother Bott. The Mission Prep class itself was interesting and we learned some cool things but honestly it didn't prepare me for my mission at all (Book of Mormon class was better for that). Brother Bott's a great guy and great professor though.
He's gone now, but I enjoyed his class, it helped me get on a mission and I met my wife in his class. sure he said some incorrect things but his heart was in the right place.
One thing I liked about Brother Bott is that he tried to answer your questions. Maybe his answers were a bunch of baloney, but he didn't treat them like they were irrelevant.
Awesome Professor... Praise to the man!
Awesome Professor... Praise to the man!
Brother Bott was awesome! Sure he's human just like everyone else but he had so much knowledge to share and had the ability to really inspire those who wanted to hear. I found his class very interesting and enjoyable.
After taking his class, I'm unsure as to why everybody raves about this class. He seems to feed his students through the system. I feel like he tried to say outrageous things to get a reaction in class. I got tired of his antics and his rushing through repetitive stories. He always said he wasn't bragging and then proceeded to do so. Unimpressed.
Bro. Bott is funny, moving, powerful, entertaining, and one of the best all-around teachers I've ever had. He makes the class more about religion and less about tests and homework, which makes it an easy A but still a powerful, life changing experience. Full marks to Randy Bott. He definitely lives up to the amazing things people say about him.
Mission prep was amazing with Brother Bott. He can always bring the spirit and he is such an interesting person. The class was probably my favorite of the semester. There aren't that many assignments and they are all pretty doable. The take home "Celebrations" take away the stress of test taking.
The Bottmeister Rules. What a guy.
AWESOME TEACHER. AWESOME CLASS.  JUST AWESOME
Best class, best teacher I've ever had.  He blows all other religion teachers out of the water.  This guy is incredible.  Most interesting class ever.  He is a powerful teacher.  It was the most applicable class to life that I've ever taken.
If you're taking Mission Prep, take Bott.  His class is interesting and informative.  Getting an A is not difficult.  We spent a great deal of class time discussing doctrine, but also the practical side of being a missionary.  Great class.
Great teacher. Sure Bott is flawed like everyone else in the world, but that's what makes his class so interesting, even with the flaws the spirit was often palpable. He isnt interested in teaching a course, he is interested in teaching individuals to get up and do something. I didn't always agree with what he said, but in most cases I learned.
I LOVED Bro. Bott's class.  He gives such interesting insight.  We spent most of the year discussing gospel basics.  If you think you have the basics of the gospel down take Bro. Bott, and you will learn so much more!  Great lecturer!  It was my earliest class, but it was the one that was easiest to stay awake in.
Bro. Bott is an excellent teacher. Everything is backed up with scripture or quotes from prophets and he spends several hours a day answering students' questions or concerns because he truly wants to help every student.
the perfect religion teacher.  manual reading was annoying
Teacher name: Smith, Hank
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Brother Smith is honestly my favorite professor at BYU. The reading assignments are very reasonable, only one (long-ish but personal in nature so it's not too bad) paper, and he gives you everything that will be on the tests. His lectures are amazing and (dare I say??) life changing!! He does joke, so if you're sensitive to that, be aware!
Great class. Not difficult; it's pretty straight-forward to do well. Just know the review slides, and you'll nail the test. I always enjoyed lecture!
Great guy. Really funny. If you don't like borderline offensive LDS jokes dont take his class. Everything he puts on the test is taken from a review slide that he presents each class period from the previous lecture. One 8-10 page paper at the end of the semester, but its entirely testimony so it's a breeze. Really cares about you. Take his class!
Brother Smith is a fantastic religion professor. He knows a lot about the scriptures and provides interesting background on the New Testament. During class, he makes lots of jokes but also knows when to be serious. His class is inspiring, interesting and educational, but easy to do well in if you come to class and pay attention.
He has the best lectures. His tests are tricky but manageable if you memorize his review slides. 1 paper- not bad. Quite a bit of reading due each class but it's worth it. Class isn't mandatory but it would be in your best interest to go so you can do well on the tests and just because he is an awesome guy. 10/10 guy. 8/10 class.
literally the coolest guy you'll meet
Make sure you go to his test reviews, If you don't you will not pass the test.
Phenomenal. His lectures and insights blew me away. I started my days of class with him and I'm so grateful I did because it got me energized for the rest of the day. The exams are tough, but if you go to the review sessions, you'll be pretty well off. Hardest religion class I have taken so far, but by no means is it too much to handle.
Brother Smith is the absolute best. He's SO funny and I really felt the Spirit and learned a ton in his class. There's a fair amount of reading before each lecture (usually 3-4 chapters from the NT and a handful of bible dictionary entries, with the occasional video or conf. talk) but I didn't think it was too bad. There's one paper, tests are easy
Brother Smith is hilarious. His tests can be difficult, but he and the TA give you what you need to study. Even with more difficult tests, his lectures make it worth it. You don't want to miss them because he's amazing.
Very glad I took this class! This would be a great class to prepare for a mission because you learn about Jesus Christ himself. You absolutely can't miss lectures - but there are very specific review slides of what you need to know for exams. Don't underestimate the tests but if you know the lectures well you're fine. I would definitely recommend!!
Hank Smith is maybe my favorite professor at BYU. I've taken REL A 122 and 250 from him, and if I can I'll take more too! His lectures are great, and while he does make you work a little (600 words a week in journals and one long paper) his class is very doable and definitely worth it. He loves his students and does everything he can to help.
WOW! One of the best religion professors here. Most of his points come from assigned reading and journal entries as well as two mid terms, a paper, and an exam. He is such an amazing professor. If you want to be inspired, learn a ton, and feel the spirit, take New Testament from Brother Smith.
Brother Smith truly cares about the wellbeing of his students. honestly the funniest teacher I've ever had! also, if you take his class you HAVE TO ask him to tell you "the cactus story", you won't regret it. He'll understand what you mean. Spiritually the class increased my testimony and gave me a deeper understanding/appreciation of Christ.
I've taken a couple classes from Hank, and I think he's made them a little bit more difficult, but that being said they're still pretty easy. Pay attention during the Review Slides, and then sit back and enjoy some of the most uplifting/hilarious lectures you'll hear in all of college. Seriously, he's a Mormon celebrity for a reason.
Brother Smith is by far the most inspiring professor I have had. He cares for your individual success in a class of 200+, and teaches the New Testament in such an engaging and incredible way. Take him! There's a reason he's so popular, because it's life-changing. Please, please take New Testament from him!!!
Brother Smith found the perfect balance between spirituality and humor without ever coming close to crossing the line. I liked his focus on the application of gospel principles rather than NT history. Tests are a bit more difficult than other religion classes I've taken, but he makes it very clear what material will be covered. Great class.
If I could vote who the next prophet would be, Hank would be my vote. He is the best teacher at BYU. I love Hank with all of my heart.
Hank Smith is by far my favorite religion professor at BYU. Very spiritual and life changing, but he throws in enough comedy to make the class really interesting and relatable. He grades on just a few things: daily journals/reading, tests and 1 10 page paper. If you take his class, you will not regret it :)
Oh Hank. If only all religion teachers could have his balance between making their classes academic yet spiritual and applicable. I've taken multiple classes from him, and they've all changed my life. You need to take a class from him during your time at BYU. HILARIOUS &amp; inspiring. For an A: come 2 class, go to TA Review &amp;Study the review slides.
Teacher name: Johnson, Stanley
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
I LOVE STANLEY JOHNSON!!!!!! He is probably the kindest soul I have ever met in my life. Do you love your grandpa? Well after you meet Stanley Johnson you will wish he was your grandpa. He isn't that old he is just so nice and caring. Great class to build your testimony but still get an easy A. Would definitely take a class from him again.
Brother Johnson is an adorable professor. His lectures were pretty good. He had 6 tests, but thankfully he reused a lot of the questions and they were not hard to get good grades on if you studied the study guide.
Wow. He's the most genuine and sweet professor you could ever have. I feel so privileged to have taken Book of Mormon from him all year. I'm sad he's retiring (well happy for him of course). He will be missed at BYU.
Brother Johnson is great. He's the grandfather everyone wishes they had. If you don't know what's that like, take Rel 122 from him. Lectures go by so quickly because he loves what he does. His enthusiasm rubs off on everyone in lecture. Best religion class taken at BYU.
Professor Johnson is a great professor, but his tests are many and difficult. Take his class for the experience. If you need a good grade or an easy religion class, look elsewhere.
Stan is the Man. Take it from him.
Johnson was hilarious, inspirational, and super easy. As long as you pay attention in lecture and review the stuff he says, you'll do just fine in the class. His lectures were entertaining and spiritual, and he managed to balance humor with seriousness in a great way.
Professor Johnson is the most caring, sweet, and down -to-earth guy! He's that older, cute kind of man and he connects with his students very well. He's really chill but expects his students to work for their grade. ATTENDANCE MATTERS. He's pretty funny too! A lot of corny jokes that really break the ice. His lectures are great! Definitely a fave!
The best professor I've had in the Ancient Scripture department. He helps you understand the teachings of the Book of Mormon, and it's not awful. He gets that religious education ISN'T your life. Pay attention in class, write down what he puts on the board, review the study guides, and you've got an A.
I love Bro. Johnson! As long as you attend lecture, take notes, and do the readings (aka daily scripture study) you will be fine. Do the study guide and you will pass the test with no problem. He is super funny and has a lot of knowledge about the BoM. I would recommend him to a friend in a heartbeat. Do what you're asked and you will get an A
I LOVE Brother Johnson! I recommend him endlessly! Compared to other religion classes at BYU  this class is a walk in the park. Study for 1.5 hours and you'll get an A on every test. Brother Johnson is a great guy and incredibly in tune with the spirit
This class was a lot of fun. If you go to class and listen to the lectures, you'll get by just fine.
Brother Johnson's class was amazing. He is such a funny guy, a cute grandpa type. His class is extremely easy. Come to class and take good notes. He gives a study guide for each test including the midterm &amp; the final, do the study guide and you will ace every test. HW is reading in the BOM and then writing a paragraph each time about what you read.
Bro Johnson was a great guy. Overall, he made us take 4 quizzes (tests) and a midterm and a final. The midterm and final were easy cuz it had the same questions as the quizzes. He teaches his opinion, which is kind of annoying. Make sure to write down everything he says, even quotes from bretheren cuz it will be on the tests.
Stan "The Man" Johnson is just the greatest guy!  Love the way he teaches BOM, he's so funny and nice.  You can tell he genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed.  Taking all religion classes from him.
Brother Johnson is the best. Don't take Book of Mormon from anyone else.
Bro Johnson is a great teacher. He has some hilarious comments, and most of what he discusses in class is on the test. A few things are from the reading and further individual comprehension, but he usually clarifies in class. 4 tests throughout the semester, plus the midterm and final, but besides those the only other grades are reading journals.
Stan is way easy, take really good notes on lectures and you'll ace the tests. He is very nice and willing to help if you go into his office hours, wants his students to succeed.
Brother Johnson is absolutely hilarious. This class completely changed my life. He always has a new, interesting insight, which drastically changed and strengthened my testimony. He admits when he doesn't know the answer, &amp; he always backs what he teaches with what prophets have taught. Loved this class. I never wanted to miss, and I'm a skipper.
Brother Johnson was a good teacher and very funny. He is a very genuine guy and teaches well. Almost everything he teaches is on the tests, but there are a few things that are not.
Teacher name: Marsh, Jeff
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Seemed indifferent and dismissive of questions or comments. Had some strong and offensive opinions that were not doctrine based. Material is clearly conveyed in the reading, though. Definitely not a hard class, easy enough if you just do the reading. Tests are easy. But I would much rather take a hard class from someone who cares.
Such good lectures. This is the second class I've taken from Dr. Marsh and I would definitely take more. His tests are extremely easy and he really focuses on you getting a lot out of the lectures. Take his classes and pay attention in class cause he will blow your mind!
While his intentions are good, I hated this class. I know for a fact people in my class left the church because of how he taught. I hated that if you asked for clarification he would say "read my book." NOTHING is posted online because hes worried people are gonna copy his stuff. Its the easiest class on earth, but hes pretty offensive.
I absolutely loved taking from Dr. Marsh. He is funny, smart, and genuinely cares about his students success. Just make sure that you pay attention to what he tells you to study in class, and you'll do great.
He's the man.  So good in lectures ant the test were not hard, if you paid attention
This class is new at BYU so they are still trying to figure out the best way to teach it. Brother Marsh is amazing and has taught me so much I didn't know about the Restoration, and it is actually interesting. The tests are easy (most people got an A) and he does little extra credit assignments like taking a picture at the church history museum.
TAKE A CLASS FROM BROTHER MARSH. I learned more from him in one semester than I learned in almost any other religion class. He knows SO much about the gospel and if you get the chance to pick his brain, do it. He knows students are busy, so the homework and tests are cake. But I still remember everything I learned in his class. No regrets.
I LOVE BROTHER MARSH. I took him for Book of Mormon AND Joseph Smith translation of the Bible. He is amazing. SO funny. His class is easy, and if you pay attention to the lectures you wont have a problem passing his tests. Also, he likes to let class out early sometimes.
Professor Marsh was pretty offensive in his manner of speaking sometimes, but overall he knew a lot about the gospel. This class was SO EASY I can't even put it into words. I never once attended class and I just reviewed the study guide before the tests and it was a breeze. There are no assignments, just 4 exams. Easiest religion class ever.
If you do the assigned readings (which really aren't bad, I promise!) you will pass easily.
I LOVED Dr. Marsh. He brought an amazing spirit into the class and makes you feel like you are of the greatest generation in the world! He strengthened my testimony and my knowledge of the book of mormon more than anybody else has and I am so grateful for him. Take his class!!!!!!
I really liked Dr. Marsh's teaching style; he brings the spirit in the classroom. Rules: (1) No electronics, period. (2)Tests are closed book, closed notes. I loved his lectures, but your grade is solely determined on your test score. I found his tests to be ridiculous. Some of his questions are so easy and some even RM's can't answer without BOM.
If you're a non-member, do not take this course from him. He means well, but his manner of speaking could be offensive or confusing. Members and non-members alike: Its not that taking it from him is bad, its that taking it from someone else could be life-changing (instead of slightly entertaining and an easy work load).
I LOVED Book of Mormon with Dr. Marsh. His lectures are amazing and I learned so much! He doesn't have any assignments or essays or anything and his tests are super easy. Just go to class and you'll do fine! I would definitely recommend Dr. Marsh.
Super smart and entertaining guy. Study the course packet before the test and you will do good. Gives plenty of extra credit. Easy A
First class he comes off as pretty annoying,  but he's not bad. I've enjoyed him!  He gives nice lessons (although honestly missing a few has not hurt my scores) and the tests are clear and straightforward. Just make sure to read the packet and student manual! He's also really good about offering extra credit if you're into that. And no busy work!
last one, I swear awkwardly laugh to get on his goodside, while he smiled his weird, sneering smile.  In all, you shouldn't even bother going to class and just study from the student manual, you'll do fine.  If you really want to learn about the Book of Mormon, please, pleeeease take it from another teacher it'll be much more enjoyable and easy.
If you want to actually learn something, choose a different teacher.  Marsh is absolutely the worst religion teacher in the school.  Sprouts off about obscure references and facts while just showing slides covered in texts.  What's worse is he doesn't allow any electronics whatsoever in class, so it's almost impossible to take notes.  Also, he
Professor Jeff Marsh is a wonderful religions teacher. I had him for Book of Mormon part one and now I'm taking New Testament from him. The lectures are inspirational and hold the spirit while he also throws in funny jokes and experiences. There's a bit of reading but it's worth it for the insite Brother Marsh provides.
Ok I went in expecting this great class because I''d only ever heard great reviews. False. I guess maybe he''s not my style I just feel like he tries to teach things as doctrine when they''re more like Mormon myth and kind of acts like If you don''t agree with me then you''re obviously wrong. I guess I wish he''d have focused more on the scriptures.

Teacher comments: 
Very sweet guy but often gets off topic and runs over time to go over all the information that is on the test. Also, be aware that you'll have to take pop quizzes which can be pretty tough so always be prepared.
I love this guy. He is my favorite BYU professor. He remembered me after my mission and where I even went. He truly cares and wants you to succeed. I loved the class and felt spiritually edified after each one. If you read the stuff and do the study guides, you will do well. He is seriously the sweetest man alive and makes you feel so special.
He is the coolest guy. He really loves what he does and loves his students. You need to read daily and attendance is for credit. He does a few pop quizzes, but they are not too difficult. He gives you a study guide which is tough to fill out, but if you do the tests are pretty easy and online.
Knows a ton about the New Testament. Gives specific study guides that are just like the tests (if you memorize them, you're good to go). Grades papers very graciously. Sweet sweet man.
Bro Wilson is one of my favorite teachers at BYU because he focuses on the importance of the BoM instead of the little details. He is extremely reasonable and would remove any questions from the tests if the topics were not discussed in class. Helpful study guides, few and simple assignments, and amazing lectures that grew my testimony.
Bro Wilson is loving and has some interesting lectures, but his exams are insane. He gets distracted for half the class and then rushes through the slides. Exam questions were often very hard and very specific. You also have to read A LOT between the assigned readings and the supplemental text. I love Bro Wilson, but wouldn't take him again.
His entire structure for teaching is wack. He will trail off during all of class time, then blaze through his power point notes in like half a second at the end and expect you to be an expert on what he "just covered", then test you on all of it. Waste of mandatory class time. Plus tests are way too specific on super small things that don't matter.
I love Brother Wilson! He is a very genuine person who cares for his students and their needs. He has a desire for his students to succeed and will help you if you go to him. I didn't always do the readings and therefor was just short of an A, but if you do the assigned readings then it is not hard to do well.
He knows a lot about what he's teaching, but he gets easily distracted. The pop quizzes can be really difficult because a question will often come from some random quote out of 30 in recent lectures. There is a lot of reading but that's understandable. Occasionally a class will slip into story time and it can be really hard to pay attention.
Bro. Wilson is great. He cares about his students' success and is more than willing to work with you. He has interesting stories and the Spirit was strong during class. Attendance and daily reading are graded. Gives occasional papers, but they're easy. If you take good notes, you will do well on the exams.
Don't listen to anybody else's negative comments, Brother Wilson is unreal. He is so relaxed when it comes to turning in assignments. Of course he wants you to turn them in on time, but if you don't he always accepts them. I loved him mostly because he just cares that you leave the class with a deeper love for the New Testament. One of my favorites
Bro Wilson is funny and his lectures are entertaining but there is a quiz every class, a ton of reading, and his tests are ridiculous. Having the entire NT memorized isn't enough, you have to take word for word notes on his lectures and he's super weird about not letting you post the study guide online.
Dr. Wilson is by far my favorite religion teacher. He is so generous with points that you stop stressing about your grades after the first class. I love his lectures, they will actually keep you interested. Learned so much from his New Testament class and wish I could take him for all my religion classes! This guy is the man!
I love Dr Wilson! He is SUCH a great religion teacher. I loved his class. He really known his stuff well, but makes it all so easy to understand. He is a really easy grader. Small assignments outside of class and a few quizzes in class.
Genuinely cares about his students. Nice man. Pop quizzes just about every other week. The essays are really easy- your feelings and personal experiences. The tests cover extremely specific information, although he does provide you with a study guide. If you have the entire Bible memorized it will be an easy A for you!
Brother Wilson is a solid guy. Really enjoyed parts of his class. He gets distracted easily and isn't clear about what we should be taking notes on. Study guides are no help to study for the test. Classes are okay but not fantastic. Tests are terrible unless you have the entire BOM memorized verse for verse.
Bro. Wilson is a great guy and has wonderful lectures. His tests, on the other hand, are very focused on his opinion and very specific to what he teaches. As long as you work on the study guides and go to class, you'll be fine. A couple short papers throughout the semester, but this class was enjoyable and an easy A.
I also took Religion 121A with Wilson and I enjoyed both classes. His lectures are great and his assignments are not difficult. Some of his test questions are poorly written but if you talk to him about them he usually will give you points back as long as you show that you understand the topics.
Great professor. He loves to teach and is super excited about the gospel. He really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. I highly recommend Brother Wilson :)
Professor Wilson is a great teacher and shows passion about what teaches. He is humble and open to your questions that you may have. He likes to work with you and help with your grade. It requires a lot of notes for tests but the class is fun to be part of! Every class is understandable and spiritual. I'm deaf so he works well with anyone.
Teacher name: Stice, Earl
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Stice is amazing. So funny, and he really cares. The class is very challenging, and he tries to trip you up on the tests. Go to the TA labs- they really help!
Stice is amazing. He's the reason I like accounting. He sets the class up so you have every single one of the tools you need to succeed, if you are willing to put in the work. Practice tests are the way to go to study for his tests. It's a hard class. But Stice makes it fun &amp; doable if you're willing to work hard. Take it from him! We all love him.
He's a really funny professor and covers the material well. Challenging class, but he gives you lots of tools to succeed: practice problems, TA help, test reviews, etc.
He's super clear about expectations and wants students to succeed. Sends out reminder emails and helps however he can. I took the hybrid course, and the in-class parts seem silly, but you need to go for credit/tests/quizzes. UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL. Don't just speed through it; go to the lab and get the concepts down and it'll be easy.
Dr. Stice engages your attention and helps you understand why accounting is important. I struggled with the online portion of this class because it usually takes about 4 hours to complete. Exams are very difficult, but if you study a ton, really pay attention, and feel like you understand pretty much everything, you should be ok.
If you want an A in this class make sure you study a lot. Accounting 200 is not the easiest class in the world, but take it from Stice. He's super funny and he makes accounting interesting, which isn't easy. By far the best teacher to take Acc 200 from. Awesome guy.
Funniest professor that I've ever had. I thought I would hate accounting but I'm actually really enjoying it. Credit to Professor Stice.
The funniest man on BYU campus bar none. The class is easy if you just put in an iota of effort.
Professor Stice is great! He provides in-depth videos that go over many problems that are similar to exam questions. If you listen in class and put in the work when studying for exams, you'll do fine.
Stice is a tough professor. He is fun in lecture, but the tests are extremely hard and trip you up anywhere they can. One plus is that he makes extensive study guides and video walk-throughs for every problem. Don't take this business prereq first, stick with marketing.
Stice is the dopest teacher at BYU. Accounting sucks but Earl Stice is a legend and you will tell legendary stories about Stice years after taking the man. Everyone gets wrecked with other accounting teachers. Take Stice.
One of the best professors there is at BYU. Take this class and you will not only learn accounting but have a lecture you can look forward to. Stice is super nice and kinda looks like Bernie Sanders, which was great during my 2016 class.
Stice is a great professor. Acc200 was very hard, however, it is very possible to do well. Go to lectures, do the readings, do well on the quizzes. Go through the practice tests &amp; make sure you understand each question. If you do this, you will do well on the tests. Also, midterm 2 is weighted more than midterm 1, &amp; the final is weighted the most.
Hands down best professor I've had at BYU. Super funny guy and loves accounting. Go through the practice tests and video walk throughs with the answers and it helps a ton on the test.
Professor Stice is an excellent teacher. He does a great job of making difficult concepts easy to understand and is very clear on when things are due. The class requires a lot of reading and a lot of quizzes, but if you stay on top of things it's very manageable.
Prof. Stice has been my favorite professor so far at BYU. His lectures are really fun and engaging and he really cares about his students. I'm not an accounting or business major and I still highly recommend this class!
Professor Stice is the best professor at the school hands down. He is clear, concise and organized. Earl Stice is the man, the myth, the legend.
Professor Stice is one of the best Professors I have ever had. He cares about his students' success and is each student's advocate. His lectures are engaging and very funny. His humor makes a boring subject much more fun. His tests are hard, but if you study you can do well. He also curves the class after the final.
Accounting 200 was a challenging class, but Professor Stice made it as engaging as possible. He is so intelligent and entertaining, and I would recommend him to anybody. But don't take his class unless you're ready to put in effort!
STICE IS NICE! STICE IS NICE! I love this man he is the GOAT of Professors. You'll have to work for it but there's no surprises about what's going to be on the test. Homework is a necessity there are quizzes every homework assignment.
Teacher name: Hinckley, Jaren
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Get ready to work your butt off all semester just to be one point off and not get the A you worked for as he absolutely refuses to help students grades. He makes his tests so unnecessarily hard for a 100 level class, especially when most if not all students are taking it for a GE. His lectures are very boring and you wont remember anything.
His exams made me laugh in the testing center. The proctors looked at me a little weird, but at least I can say I enjoyed the tests. Dr. Hinckley tries really hard to make class interesting and funny. I think even if you don't know classical music very well you can still learn to appreciate the story of how music evolved.
He's a fantastic professor! I took it as a term class that only met twice a week, so each class was 2.5 hours long. I was dreading music 101, but he makes it fun. He teaches with a flair and it's just a good class. He's reasonable and the grades are really easy. I'd definitely recommend!
Awesome class, loved the professor, easy extra credit and super interesting. Lectures cover the readings so one or the other but make sure to do all the assignments early as they can definitely creep up. TAKE THIS CLASS
Dr. Hinckley is awesome! He gives tons of extra credit. Even if you're not familiar with music, you can succeed because he teaches so well. If you play any instrument or sing, this class is a no brainer. The only downside is that you have to attend around 6 concerts and write about them, which takes a lot of time. Other than that, great class.
Professor Hinckley is a great music teacher! He is a good choice if you need an A for this general education class, and you will also learn so much about music from him! You will never listen to music the same way after this class.
Dr. Hinckley was very helpful in this class. He graded assignments shortly after you would submit them. He is very passionate about music and you can see that when he teaches. I highly recommend this class it was very doable. It is challenging that you do have to memorize pieces of music but he gives you opportunities to do extra credit
Look everyone says this class is easy but if you have NO MUSICAL background then it is tough. I just heard I needed to know all the songs. I am not kidding I knew all the songs perfectly and I would get solid 75% on the test. I'm not an idiot either...
The class was easy. Very easy to fall asleep so beware. He is very kind and very clear. The biggest thing is memorizing the songs for the test. If you do, you'll get an A. If you don't, easily a B or lower. Easy assignments. Remember, just make sure to memorize all the songs for the tests! That is the test! I recommend him for the GE.
This is the easiest class you will ever take. I stopped going to class after the first week and just made sure I memorized the pieces we were supposed to recognize for the test and got an A in the class.
If you have a background in music, this class will be a breeze. If not, it may be a more serious undertaking. Dr. Hinckley is a great guy who you can tell loves what he does. He wants his students to succeed and gives you the tools to do so (most organized Learning Suite I have ever seen!). It's an easy A, but also very rewarding if you let it be.
Professor Hinckley is a really great person and is very passionate about Music. He truly cares for each and every one of his students. However, if you do not have a solid background with Music, then you will spend many hours studying for each of the tests. Reasonable grading system, but it seems like a lot of time is lost in class.
Okay, I don't know how all these people got easy A's. If you don't enjoy listening to classical music and opera for hours and hours trying to remember certain composers, genres, and other stuff, dont take this class. It's a pain and unless you major in art it will not benefit you in any way. Studied for 5 hours for the first midterm and got 67%.
Professor Hinckley was one of the easiest professors that I have ever had. He gives you study guides for the test and as long as you know the selected music to be memorized, you're golden. 11/10 would recommend.
Dr. Hinckley is the perfect teacher for this class. He's so passionate about music history and is excellent at explaining stylistic changes from different eras. Going to class is optional because the book is pretty good; however, his lectures clarify really any questions you might have. Also, there are lots of opportunities to receive extra credit.
LOVE DR HINCKLEY! TAKE THIS CLASS!! Easiest A you will ever get. He is so clear in his teaching and grading, and 100% willing to help or discuss grades, etc. Tests are super easy and you always know exactly what to study. Lots of extra credit opportunities. I took it just 2nd term and it was a breeze so a semester would be literally nothing. DO IT!
Hinckley is amazing. Absolutely must take this class from him. Super accessible, not trying to trick anyone, and great instructor. I had an A but still considered dropping the class just so I could take it again. He's one-of-a-kind. And I learned a ton about music
Music 101 is dry for anyone except people obsessed with music history. Dr. Hinckley made it as interesting as it can be. I laughed a few times, fell asleep a lot of times, and got annoyed by his extra story telling about once a week. Fine class, easy A, average professor.
I LOVED THIS CLASS AND TEACHER!!! This class helped me develop a deep appreciation and passion for music, as well as the development of it. I will keep this textbook forever.
I am not a musical person but this class with Hinckley was incredible. I took it Spring semester, and finished the semester with a 101%. He gives three tests (2 mid terms and 1 final). Grading is fair, and you know exactly what to study for and how to complete assignments! You're required to memorize musical pieces and composers-just listen daily.
Teacher name: Wilkinson, Ron
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Wilkinson is one of my favorite professors at BYU! He is so caring about his students and wants every one of them to pass! There are no tests in this class, but you do have to give 8 speeches and write a papers. If you put in the work, you are going to get a good grade! Take from him!!! I learned some lifelong skills and had fun doing it!
I took public speaking just for fun, and it was a great class. Definitely gives you the chance to get out of your comfort zone by giving several speeches in front of the class. I probably averaged around a 90 on my speeches, but he gives lots of opportunity for extra credit so it was easy to make up.
I really enjoyed the way the class was set up. There are seven speeches that you give throughout the semester. None are over five minutes, though, so don't freak out. You will write around four papers. He gives you every opportunity to succeed, tons of extra credit. He is kind and facilitates great discussions.
My friend recommended Prof. Wilkinson &amp; I am so glad. I gained more than I ever expected. Prof. Wilkinson knows so much &amp; leads by example. He's inspiring &amp; the skills go beyond what's learned in high school or church. As we progressed through the topics/skills I noticed I could use them in my other classes, church, &amp; work - best prof/class ever!
Prof Wilkinson is such a great guy! He really cares about his students and cares about making you a better public speaker. The grade seems to be less important to him than actually seeing his students progress. He also has super good tips, and some really awesome and inspirational stories. Super cool teacher, pretty easy A, I recommend.
This class improved my public speaking skills a lot more than I anticipated! I also felt like the class had a great atmosphere and I also grew closer to my classmates. Prof. Wilkinson is very organized and it's crystal clear what's expected. He treats his students like adults and sincerely cares about them. I would recommend this class to anyone.
This online class with Prof. Wilkinson is amazing. It is well organized, assignments well spread out, and instructions clear. The feedback was detailed and encouraging. I looked forward to each assignment because the format was easy to follow. I felt my speech skills improved greatly over the semester. Prof. was approachable and quick to reply.
I love Ron!!! He is the best teacher to take public speaking from--you will improve so much, and he really cares about your success. There are a lot of extra credit opportunities available to you if you don't do well on the speeches. One of my favorite classes this semester.
I wish that class is more challenging and gears toward to professional presentation.
Prof. Wilkinson is a wonderful professor who loves teaching and makes an extra effort to be available for individual help.
Brother Wilkinson is a wonderful professor. You really won't regret taking his class. He helps you become a better public speaker with the material he uses to teach his students and he really cares about each student. Definitely a class I recommend and have truly enjoyed taking this past semester.
He sends you reminders when you forget turning something in which I believe that's the first professor that has done this to me. But it shows me that he cares about us! Makes you work hard, and is a tough grader, but he also offers good feedback.
I took the class in the Summer term. This class was less stressful than I thought it would be, and I think that I got the grade that I deserved. It was super busy, so I didn't have time to read the textbook, although the professor tells you how to prepare yourself. I have improved a lot, even though I know I didn't know that hard for it.
Wonderful teacher, I took public speaking and despite not always loving the class I feel like I grew in a great way. He is extremely kind and involved with the students. He makes you feel comfortable with public speaking.
This class is calm, not too stressful, he's a fair grader and very straightforward. No tests, just speeches. If you put in the effort to get an A, you will have no problem at all. Ron is just an amazing person. You will not regret taking this class unless you don't want to learn about public speaking.
If you're going to take public speaking, take it from Professor Wilkinson. As long as you follow the formula, you'll do really well. TONS of extra credit opportunities even if you're not perfect. You can use notes for all your speeches except for the last one. It's a great class to just improve your skills in a really low-stress environment.
Professor Wilkinson gives great feedback on each and every one of the speeches. Students who plan on missing more than 3 classes will have to make up for the speech in class. Don't bother to take it if you are going to miss more than 3 classes.
Professor Wilkinson didn't have on-campus office hours, but he was available by text or email most times of the day. He is a very down-to-earth guy and matter-of-fact when telling students what is expected. He gives great examples of all of the types of speeches and assignments. A great class simply for improving skills, not just for the credit.
Professor Wilkinson is an amazing speech teacher. If you follow the criteria on the grading sheet, you should do fine. He is a tough grader on the speeches, but other assignments and lots of extra credit will help boost your grade. He cares a lot about his students and he is always willing to help out outside of class. Highly recommend this class!!
It was a great class that helped me to improve in many areas
Teacher name: Wood, Steven
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He's a great professor. His lectures aren't always directly correlated with the tests, but he cares about his students and is very accessible if you want to meet with him. He loves Chemistry and is great at conveying that to his students. Tests are long and can be beastly, but it is very possible to get an A in the class.
To put it simply, I felt that Dr. Wood was completely non-existent and 100% apathetic during the entirety of this class. I received no emails or communication from him during the entire semester. The material is poorly organized, the majority of information in the videos is irrelevant, and there is nothing that sparked my interest whatsoever.
Dr. Wood fails to cover most of the material that is included on the test. His tests are also ridiculously long, taking between 2-4 hours each. I would highly recommend taking this class from someone else.
If you have to take CHEM 105 take it from Dr. wood. This man does a fantastic job explaining not only the material but the history behind the chemistry. He structures his class well. Don't get me wrong you have to put in the work to get the grade. The TA's do a great job and make sure you go to the reviews!
Dr. Wood is the best!!! He is so kind and willing to help his students. He has great TA's, and his lectures are always interesting and funny. He does great demonstrations to help teach concepts! There are lots of easy homework assignments with review sessions, and his tests are long, but it's so we can get a couple questions wrong and not fail!
This was my second time taking this class. Dr Wood makes class interesting but he fails to discuss much of the content that is included on the test. His tests are also unnecessarily long (2-4 hrs). Do yourself a favor and don't take this class from him.
Dr. Wood is AMAZING! He teaches entirely by experiments and on the chalkboard which is so nice! You don't have to take tons of notes in class but understand the concepts more than with powerpoint. Homework is exactly like his tests so if you do it then you're set! Best TAs I've ever had. Posts videos that help a ton! Take him if you want an A!
Such an amazing professor! He cares that the students understand and enjoy what they're learning. You get a homework assignment each recitation and a smartwork each week. The worksheets and reviews are super helpful for preparing you for the tests. The TA's are super helpful and lectures are fun. I definitely recommend taking Chem 105 from Wood!
This class was great. Dr. Wood is funny and cares a lot about his students. His lectures were sometimes all over the place but his TA's helped with learning new concepts. Homework after each recitation, and 5 tests total including the final. Everyone in that class is there to help, you have to work hard to do well.
Dr. Wood is my favorite teacher at BYU. He has such an in depth knowledge of the subject he teaches, it makes it really interesting to listen to his lectures and have your questions answered. I could always find him in office hours and he was happy to help with difficult topics. He has a passion for teaching, take his class and you won't regret it
Chem 105 is a hard class no matter who you take it from. Doctor Wood is the best though!! I wood not take it from anyone else;) There are 4 midterms, a final and the homework load is not bad compared to other chem 105 teachers. He's super passionate about chemistry and always does cool demonstrations. One of my favorite professors so far at BYU!
Great Chemistry professor. Dr. Wood is entertaining, caring, provides real life applications, teaches the material well, and provides all the preparation you need to succeed on his tests. If you go to lectures and the recitations with the TAs you should do well in this class. Textbook use is optional but you need the online program that comes with.
A fantastic professor that structures the class in a way that is do-able compared to other Chem 105 professors. Online and hard copy HW assignments. Test every 3 weeks. Hilarious man with a passion that makes you happy to be in class every day!
Dr. Wood's lectures were all over the place. He would occasionally throw some random scribbles on the board, but had no lecture slides when I took the class from him. I never knew when he was saying something important or going off on a tangent, and even when clearly important, you needed to be in his head to understand what he was saying.
Dr. Wood is great for chem 105! I was super stressed going into this class because it hurts so man student's GPAs, but Dr. Wood is by far one of the easier chem 105 teachers. He does have more tests but as long as you understand concepts you can easily get As on them. There are three homework assignments and one lab a week. So glad I took him!
Really liked Dr. Wood. He made lectures enjoyable and was very goofy in his way of teaching. He has online homework once a week and worksheets twice a week. And there were tons of resources online that helped me if I fell behind. There's an exam for every unit but if you study well, youll do just fine and end up feeling prepared for the final.
I absolutely love Dr. Wood. He has made chemistry my favorite subject at BYU. The lower rating seems to be due to a higher level chem class where a lot of students didnt try very hard. But go through and read the 105 reviews, all of them are phenomenal. He has VIDEOS for everything and has put A LOT of effort into them, and they help A TON!
Doctor Wood is a really great guy. If you're willing to work hard he is willing to help you. CHEM 105 is hard no matter who you take it from but Wood really cares that you understand. He also chooses really good TAs which makes the class way better.
Dr wood needs to quit before he ruins what was once a good reputation as a professor at BYU. Arrogant and ignorant of others. Directionless classes and wings everything. Was good at 105 but ide rather take 481 from any other professor than him. He thinks everything he says is inspired. Not at all recommended
I was in the exact same lectures as everyone else that took Chem 105 from Dr. Wood this winter and I really have no idea why they are complaining. He makes chemistry interesting and about as clear as it can be. He also picked some solid TAs. Absolutely take Chem 105 from him!
Teacher name: Macedone, Jeffre
School name: Brigham Young University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Macedone is incredible. Seriously the best lecturer I have ever seen and definitely has more energy than any professor I've had. The concepts can be hard, but his expectations are extremely clear. He really wants you to succeed and he is so passionate about what he teaches. 10/10 would recommend to everyone.
Professor Macedone is a good choice for Chem106. He understands and explains all of the material very well. The class is difficult because of the subject matter but he doesn't try to trick or confuse you on assignments or exams. He has several mini-tests throughout the semester so each one is weighted less and helps you see your progress.
Fantastic! Engaging, passionate lectures, loves chemistry and wants you to succeed. Don't EVER skip class or even be a few minutes late. Approachable, and explains things well. Exams fluctuate in difficulty, but you will absolutely have to work for a good grade. Not an easy class, but he drops a lot of grades, and he and TAs are extremely helpful
Dr. Macedone is a solid guy. He is funny, energetic, caring, but he really pushes you to learn. I didn't really like his class, but he did a good job at making it not-so-sad.
Dr. Macedone was awesome! He is so enthusiastic about what he teaches, it's contagious. He actually cares about his students too. He would go around to the groups during lab answering questions and making sure our experiments were going well.
Dr. Macedone is one of the best professors on campus! I loved this class. The concepts are hard, but he doesn't try to trick you. Macedone wants you to succeed and it's very clear. You have to put in the work, but his lectures are super helpful. I learned so well from him, he's so passionate about what he teaches. I highly recommend his class!
Dr Macedone made Chem 106 an even better class for me. His lectures were helpful for learning the material, and he used iClickers to register participation in class. His tests were difficult but doable. He is very willing to help you learn the material during class and outside of class. He also made lectures a fun experience.
Awesome with basic chemistry concepts, but doesn't teach the harder concepts well (or at all), then hits you with test questions covering the difficult. If you are studious, read, and do EXTRA practice, you will be fine. If you don't understand chemistry well, and are Pre-med, expect to work pretty hard. Oh and you have to write two essays...
Minimal feedback on assignments during the semester. Poorly written exams. Unclear grading criteria. Did not feel respected or enjoy the class.
Chem 227 was hard, but Dr. Macedone made it enjoyable. The class is "under construction," I liked the class. I can recommend him and the class.
He's a real piece of work. He is incredibly self-righteous and can say some of the most awful things with a smile and a pep in his step because if you smile it's not rude. He insights competition in his students when he should be trying to help. His tests are written to trick and not to test mastery of the material.
Dr. Macedone is a great professor. He cares about how students learn. Chem 227 is a hard course regardless of the professor, but Dr. Macedone tries to make up for it with great lectures and ample time to talk through problem students experience. He is in it for the students. If you match his energy, this class is a great experience.
Prof Macedone is SO AMAZING. He is such a funny guy who has a true passion for not only chemistry, but his students. He really cares about your success and understanding of content. Never hesitant to take advantage of his office hours if you're ever in need. His tests are kinda the worst, but you walk out of the class really learning something.
Dr. Macedone is a great professor and he's very enthusiastic and hilarious. He really tries to make lectures fun and I was actually able to learn a lot from him. There are a lot of tests and I probably would've gotten an A- if I hadn't of bombed the final, even though I got about 100% on all the other assignments. Great class, Chem is always hard.
Dr. Macedone is such a good teacher! I really enjoyed being in his class. He makes the lectures very engaging. There are a lot of tests, just be aware.
Though he touches on some topics more effectively than others, Dr. Macedone is a very competent professor. Tests range from medium to difficult and require a thorough understanding of the concepts. Since there are so many tests though, it's easy to burn out near the end, but stick with it! You won't regret it.
After the last day of class I realized how much even though it wasn't my major, I 've enjoyd this class. I liked the instructors passion about teaching, that helped me stay interested throughout the class. The class is hard, but all my classes at BYU are hard. I hear a lot of students complaining about working for it, and that's just college..
This class was very straight forward and the lectures were great. I never read the textbook and just studied the slides, did Smartwork, and talked to the TAs. I averaged 96% on the 6 tests with just that. He also gives extra credit!! There are 6 tests, but all Chem 106 classes are doing 6 tests now. It was much easier than Chem 105.
Macedone has a passion for chemistry that is contagious. If you can stay on top of the material then chemistry isn't too bad. He gives 6 midterms (the last being the last day of class, right before finals) and drops your lowest. He gives plenty of opportunity for extra credit. Macedone is super helpful outside of class as well if you are struggling
Prof. Macedone is a very engaging professor. He uses powerpoints and does a lot of demonstrations to help teach. He is very willing to help outside of class and is really helpful during his office hours if you have any concerns. Tests are tough and don't really follow the homework style very well. Reading is necessary if you want a good grade.
Teacher name: Geller, Ross
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great professor but some strange class days, definitely keeps it interesting with his "special guests"
Prof Geller is certainly unique. At the start of the term he had an interesting accent. A few classes later it seemed to wear off. Maybe he just got used to our culture. I found it a bit strange, and was going to ask him about it, but he only wanted to answer questions about paleontology. Don't miss class, because he gives a great slide show!
A great teacher! Would take again, but he's kinda weird... one time his friend came in and offered us to go with her to the movies and he told us we couldn't join. Also, a woman came in saying he was still married to her? I didn't know he was married! I thought he said he was on a break, but great teacher overall!
Hard to understand with his accent, which was heavier some days compared to others?
Class was boring, I really needed a break...
He's a good prof. He's passionate, but he kept on yelling at me for eating his sandwich???????
Funny professor, but was sort of weird, demonstrated dinosaur noises and instead of giving us a study guide/chapters to study in textbook, he told us to use unagi and we all got a B. Dont make grammatical errors or mention anything about a break or the name Rachel or else he gets really worked up.
When studying for a test he told us to use something called Unagi idk weird he also gave everyone a B on the last essay even though one girl wrote like a page only
Good professor. Not a great person. He dated my friend (who was his student) for several weeks and even went on her spring break trip. But then he dumped her for being immature?!! We water ballooned him though
I absolutely adored Professor Geller. It was by far the easiest class I have ever taken. He is sooo funny. He even had nicknames for everyone! Mine was Cutie McPretty which is funny because my name is Liz. I wonder if he will read the evaluation I sent in. &lt;3
He gave me a D for inappropriate comment I gave to his turkey sandwich.
He is a real gem
Dr. Geller is an interesting dude. He gave me a new perspective on dinosaur sounds. Always encouraged breaks during class unless it involved a student named Rachel. He kept getting this girl Emily mixed up with Rachel but other than that he was great. We already are always entertained by his drama. Overall a great man and an entertaining class.
only prof that brought bagpipes&amp;a keyboard to class. extremely passionate about dinosaurs demonstrates how they sound always there for you outside of class&amp;truly cares about students taught us unagi .. however make sure not to make grammatical mistakes/eat a turkey sandwich/mention anything about a break in class he gets pretty upset about that
very passionate about the subject, aside from the dinosaur sounds and fake British accent he would sometimes play the keyboard or bagpipes in class.. just make sure to not make grammatical mistakes on the paper because sometimes he would correct students with YOUR or YOURE  overall pretty easy A
Dr. Geller was an amazing professor. He really knows what he's talking about, and let us go to his museum exhibits for extra credit. However, he spoke a lot about his daughter Emma and about some lady who he's not really married to named Rachel. Also, some weirdo with a guitar named Phoebe preformed in class occasionally. Strange, but memorable.
Dr. Geller is probably the best professor i've had at school. Only weird thing is his fake accent. He also showed up on roller blades once. interesting dude, interesting class experience. It was pretty difficult so i think i'm gonna go on a break after taking this class.
Best professor
By far the greatest class Ive ever taken. The material is beyond boring but hes such a cool dude. Sometimes leaves in the middle of class to go to a coffee shop called central perk? I dont know pretty weird but overall a great class
Got a B since he wanted to make out with Professor Wheeler instead of read my paper. Not sure what kind of rationale this is, but he was my only choice. Avoid at all costs.
Teacher name: Ohayon, Yoel
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Literally the best: had him as TA for both gen chem I and II. always gives the best advice for quizzes in recitation on Friday cares a lot about his students, our sleep, how we are, our grades. the funniest guy has LOTS of office hours and he'll tell you whenever he has via email every time, and he'll be incredibly helpful (in rec and office hours)
Yoel is the rare NYU science professor who cares for his students. DNA Nanotech isn't easy and his lectures can be scattered, but he does everything he can to help you understand both outside of lecture and in recitation. He can be a tough grader on exams, but he literally tells you what concepts will be on the exam during lecture - go to class.
Yoel is awesome, and the best TA in Gen Chem. I strongly recommend taking him. Just be warned: he'll sometimes tell everyone to stop what they're doing in the lab to tell a bad dad joke.
Yoel is the best TA in all of General Chemistry, and probably in all of NYU. He cares about all of his students and teaches only towards their success! He gives excellent tips for quizzes and exams, and makes chemistry genuinely more fun. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't choose him for as your recitation instructor. :)
Yoel is the absolute best!! I had him for both Chem I and Chem II and loved him! He is very passionate about chemistry and will be willing to help you whenever you need it! Overall, I highly recommend taking Yoel if you can
LOVE LOVE LOVE Yoel! Honestly the best recitation instructor every! Definetely take him if you have a chance
Yoel is honestly the best recitation instructor ever! He always sends us resources for studying for the midterms/finals, and always answers any questions you have (he literally responds to his emails in 2 minutes). Definitely choose him when you take gen chem!!!
Yoel regularly sends out emails with study tips and guides. He keeps you updated with course work and grades.
Yoel is the best thing to happen to General Chemistry. If you have a chance to take his recitation, DO SO! I've learned the most on Friday recitations, more so than in Lab or even in lecture. He really combines individual-learning, group-learning, and lecture-based learning. He's amazing and caring and will make sure you UNDERSTAND the material.
I felt that I got a true grasp of chemistry during his recitation and he truly had the best interest of his students in mind. If possible, I would 100% recommend that you enroll in his lab and recitation sections.
Yoel is honestly one of the best TA's you could ever have for Gen Chem! Try to get his recitation session--ask someone who had him last semester as he lets them know what sections he teaches. He's caring, funny, and honestly always there if you need someone to talk to. He made chem understandable and is such an easygoing guy. Definitely recommend!
Yoel is truly the best recitation instructor. He cares and makes learning fun and easy. You could talk to him about anything and he strays away from making class stressful. I would take him ten times over.
Yoel was a wonderful TA and genuinely cared about his students. He was always accessible and didn't take long to email back. I had him for recitation and he would go over important concepts that we needed to know for the exam. He is also a very funny and laid back guy. Take his class if you get the chance!
Professor Yoel was what made morning lab, interesting, fruitful, unique and enjoyable. He cares about his students, he wants what is best for them, and would go out of his way to make sure we understood what we are doing on a theoretical and practical level. His sense of humor, along with his mastery over teaching the subject is what made him GOAT.
Yoel was my favorite TA at NYU ever. He really cares about his students and his sense of humor and personality make chemistry fun. He is super accessible outside of class and always emails back within minutes, and his emails with study tips and chemistry info are really useful. If you have a chance to take any of his classes, I highly recommend it.
One of the most respected and well liked teachers out there. Incredibly easy to get along with. Always has great material ready for you in order to crush the exams, and has never failed to go out of his way to help me if need. Highly recommend!
Yoel was the best professor and TA ive had at NYU - he explained chemistry concepts extremely well and always made sure we were well prepared for the exams. His office hours were open on the weekends and made it extremely easy to excel if you put in the effort!
Yoel is the best! Do anything you can to take one of his classes. Best recitations, and so helpful in and outside of class. He cares so much about every student and is ALWAYS available if you have any questions.
Hes a great guy!
Honestly, you can't go through undergraduate and have a fulfilling college experience without taking a class with Yoel. A funny guy and relatable as hell. He will make chemistry a piece of cake and does everything to help you along the way. A definite must!!!!!!!
Teacher name: Halpin, John
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Halpin is very caring and drops one of your tests (including the final), but last semester decided to make us self-teach ourselves 2 chapters of chemistry. I took this class confident that I could finally do well in chemistry (I've always hated it), but this just made me struggle more in the final as I didn't understand anything.
This year, Professor Halpin thought it would be okay to not teach 2 chapters and make us self-teach ourselves. He would also lie to us about the coverage of each exam. Most people LOVE this professor, however I think he's mediocre. The only reason I did well was because I taught myself most of the material. However, he is VERY detailed/good lecture
Tough class, lots of homework, over 20 questions a week, ask questions go to his office hours, Im afraid to but I should go!
This man is a god. For all you freshman out there, do not fret, this man is a lovable bear on this inside even though he seems cutthroat. He'll make you love chemistry. Do all the homework and practice exams (UNDERSTAND the problem, don't copy formulas), and this class is an easy A. Lab was more tedious honestly.
The key is to attend lecture! Tbh, I didn't because I figured out that as long as you click in once before 9:15, you're present. But his explanations and examples are important. Do the homework, DO THE PRACTICE TESTS, go to his review sessions. I had a really hard time, but he wants you to learn. Great guy, just be ready to work for your grade!
He's amazing. Although it's really easy to skip the lectures, they're worth going to because Halpin's great at explaining the material.
Best Professor, great teacher!
Teaches both Gen Chem I and II, so you'll probably have him for both semesters. First semester, I didn't like the class at all and struggled really hard, but that's honestly because I'm not that good at chem. As long as you really put the effort in and realize that he REALLY just wants you to learn, you'll do fine.
He was really good.
I think this goes without saying, but you absolutely HAVE to study and put in a lot of your own work if you want to succeed in this class. Especially if you haven't taken AP Chem. Halpin was pretty good about facilitating that, and he gave you everything you needed to know. That doesn't mean he's an easy A. You'll need to do a lot more on your own.
If you pay attention in class, there is a high likelihood that you'll get a good grade. Explains concepts well and grading policy is fair.
Our class textbook is word for word what he says in lecture. You can nod off during class and won't miss out on too much. He has a clear lecture style and is a pretty funny guy. The exams are pretty lenient - as long as you show understanding, you will get partial to full credit. Homework is a lot but isn't a big deal as long as your TA is chill.
Halpin is my man. By far my favorite professor this semester. He explains things so well and doesn't go fast in lecture. The tests test your concepts, so you have to memorize nearly nothing. And they're pretty easy as long as you go over the practice exam. I hope I get professors like him in the future, I cant say enough good things about him.
Great professor! I learned a lot in his class. Definitely recommended.
John Halpin is one of the worst professors in the chemistry department. He reads word-for-word off a pdf during lectures. His homework assignments are ridiculously tedious (30 problems a week). Overall, he wastes a ton of time on stupid stuff like writing an extended essay on significant figures. I recommend taking chemistry at Tandon.
General Chemistry is a very heavy class that requires at least triple the amount of time and effort of your average class at NYU. His quizzes are tricky, but the midterms are OK. I am not premed, so taking this class was a mistake, but I am learning a lot more than I did in High School chemistry. The class isn't that difficult, just A LOT of work.
Very nice and caring. I definitely recommend Halpin! A great professor but definitely have to work hard to get A in his class. Lectures are fine as long as you pay attention and do homework.
honestly a very straightforward prof, about grading, exams, etc. lectures are kind of unnecessary, textbook is p good and he provides notes anyway.  quizzes make a difference, so actually try for those. repetition and practice are key in his class, do all problems provided - he models his questions off of other ones previously asked.
Took Halpin's gen chem sequence two semesters in a row. The man is a legend. Highly recommended!
Halpin's a clear explain and also understands that in Chem101 we mainly care about grades and getting a foundation for harder stuff and does teach to that. That being said, he also takes its status as a weed-out class seriously, with time-consuming homework and tricky test questions (go for partial credit!) It's an easy pass, but not an easy A.
Teacher name: Lieberman, Marc
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Lieberman clearly knows what hes talking about but isnt great at teaching it. Sloppily hand writes lecture notes on notepad and talks at the same time. While deciphering his handwriting you must also try to understand him without a microphone. Tests were hard enough but doable with a lot of studying. One of my least favorite teachers thus far.
I strongly recommand to take his classes. his exams are super easy.
Terrible tests, lectures are okay. Everyone cheats on tests so make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. Made me want to drop out of econ major, but dw other professors are much better.
One of my favorite profs so far. I'm taking him again next semester and I highly recommend. Graded fairly and pretty doable homeworks once a week to once every two weeks. Doesn't require you to go to recitation but I highly recommend going to class cus the classes are fun and he doesn't post notes. Great guy great class.
My favorite professor I've had at NYU. Lectures are clear (he writes as he talks so you know what's most important), and he tells lots of funny stories that keep you engaged and have lessons about economics imbedded in them. Tests are all multiple choice, very fair, and easy to do well on if you go to class and take good notes.
Good teacher, but all his exams are multiple choice, so you don't get partial credit. You either get it right or wrong, and that can really mess you up in the exam.
with great lecture Marc would speed through material and never look back to see if the class can keep up. Attendance isn't mandatory but i highly suggest going because you wont know what going on. Hw material is based off of recitation.
Lieberman definitely knows what he's talking about. Lectures are amazing and informative--take good notes. You will have to put some effort in but it's not too difficult. I would highly recommend him!
Took his class for both macro and micro. Considering the other Econ professors, Lieberman is the best. The book is optional but helpful. He gives you the tools to get an A, and the workload is average. He's funny. He's very easy to follow and organized. He's quite anti-trump. His micro class is awesome. Macro is ok.
A really great Economics professor. Extremely caring towards students. Just be sure to attend lecture and recitation as that is where everything is taught. Even if you purchase the textbook, you still might have a hard time getting all of the concepts.
Incredibly warm, charismatic, funny and caring. Lectures were brilliant. I learned more in this class than I have in every other class combined. For grades, no one got below a C because Lieberman is very generous and genuinely wants students to thrive. Very helpful and kind during office hours. Stellar class with stellar teacher.
Great lecturer, not so great teacher. He speeds through material at a mechanical pace for the full hour 15, never stopping to review anything. Expects students to ask questions then talks at them like they're dumb. His mult choice require knowledge of minutia from his dense/long lectures and are LSAT style. May or may not be a recovering alcoholic.
Extremely overrated, but overall still a great professor. Tests are fair, lectures are informative, and homework is do-able.
One of the most amazing teachers I had at NYU and would recommend 100%. He makes his tests straightforward, and is extremely engaging when teaching. I hope to take a class with him again in the future.
Simply the best Prof at nyu. He is the main reason why I chose Econ as my major. I wish to take every econ class with him. He is simply extraodinary at teaching.
Best professor at NYU by far! He clearly cares about students and gives you all the tools to get an A. He is super clear, fair and approachable. Would take him again in a heartbeat
Lieberman is probably the best professor I've ever taken in college. His lectures are super interesting and he knows how to keep them from dragging. He teaches very clearly and with great examples so you actually understand the theory. Homework problems are straightforward and use math to apply what he taught in class. Definitely recommend taking!
One of the best professors I've had -- he is clear in his lectures, always willing to help students understand concepts outside of class, tells hilarious stories and lectures don't get boring. Textbook isn't necessary, recitation isn't obligatory and grade is decided on 3 non-cumulative exams + problem sets every week or so. Fun and mostly easy!
Lieberman is great. His lectures are very engaging and he does a good job explaining unfamiliar concepts. Be sure to attend lectures because he doesn't use powerpoint slides. The textbook is a good resource, but it's not required to do well in the class (however, it comes with the Aplia software used for homework, so you pretty much have it anyway)
Lieberman is exceptionally lucid, good-natured, interesting, and funny. He spices up his (already amazing) lectures with funny and fascinating stories of protectionism gone wrong. Tests and problem sets are a fair reflection of lectures, with few if any surprises. Overall, International Econ is the best class I've taken at NYU.
Teacher name: Renzi, Vincent
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
First of all, I respect this professor's passion for the material. He knows his stuff and his lectures can get quite interesting. However, he only wants you to regurgitate his ideas of the texts on papers/exams. Secondly, the course is flawed, with a standard college courseload it's humanly impossible to read all of the texts.
I had a hard time following a long and keeping up with the class material. The professor was a great instructor, I just don't think the class was for me.
extremely hard course, but amazing professor
Not sure what his lectures are like but Socrates and his Critics was a small seminar and it was awesome. Prof Renzi loves what he does and is so knowledgable about not only classics but about just about everything. I would always ask him about something not related to the course before class started and we'd have a great discussion about it.
Professor Renzi has excellent story-telling skills, and the class I took, on Xenophon, was the most rewarding class of the semester, the lessons I learned connected to other subject matter and I felt thoroughly engaged and interested in what was being taught.
Renzi is phenomenal. He's not your buddy and he's not some new professor looking to get good recs. He's your professor. Be a student and you will learn. Let your TAs prove why your "outside insights" are wrong in recitation.
He claims that this class is not philosophical, but I beg to differ. I've never taken a "philosophy class" before. It has never been an interest, and that still hasn't changed. HOWEVER, I will not deny that I learned alot. It was a pretty good experience, even if it was my last choice for a Texts and Ideas class. Buy the books online! It's cheaper.
Lectures are horrible- repeat his opinions from them on any test/paper. He isn't receptive to outside insight from students. No feedback on graded work/exams. No handouts/grades posted online so you'll never feel confident in how you're doing in the course. GO TO RECITATION- your TA is your best friend if this guy is your professor.
The course is not meant to be an easy A, plain and simple. There is no doubt the material is demanding, but you CAN do well by paying attention and looking to understand the texts. I've honestly learned more in this class than I ever expected. It's one of those where every grade is fought for and satisfying. If you want to coast, look elsewhere.
The class was interesting, but also really difficult. Besides him being kind of arrogant, he only accepts his point of view. BUT the TAs and weight of assignments help. I got a C on the first midterm (8% of grade), a B on the second midterm (I think like 12%?), but did well on a few papers and ended with an A-. Not an impossible class!
While I enjoyed much of the material covered in this course and loved the readings, this was a VERY DIFFICULT class. Yes, Renzi is arrogant but my frustrations stemmed from his overly particular grading style. You may learn a lot and have interesting theories, but if you dont regurgitate his lectures from class, your grade suffers. Not my style.
Very hard class, one of the hardest I've taken at NYU. However, the content is interesting, and he is an engaging speaker so lectures are never boring. Take notes very carefully as the lecture is very detail-packed and everything in the lecture will be on the exam. One of the most challenging but fascinating classes I've ever taken
Not much grade inflation — he keeps it real. If that's not your thing, don't take him (there are other, easier 'Texts and Ideas' classes). Sometimes he's very sanctimonious, but he's passionate with a real point of view. I learned a lot from this class. From my experience, you have to do the readings to get a good grade.
Professor is arrogant and insufferable, but the class is trivially easy. You barely even have to do the readings if you pay attention in recitation and maybe scribble occasional notes in lecture. I don't really get the complaints about the difficulty, as I didn't even read any of the books and still pulled an A-...
Lectures are well detailed. EXTREMELY difficult readings. A hard grader. isn't clear about what he wants from you. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEXTS AND IDEAS CLASS.
So far, the worst professor I've ever taken at NYU. Both, his personality and teaching skills aren't the best for an educational place. One day, I listened to him saying to one of his TA's to grade essay and HW assignments hardly. I totally understand he wants us to learn, but a C- on a paper that was workshopped three times is just unfair. AVOID!
I would highly recommended especially if you're interested in philosophy. It is extremely hard but was the most rewarding required class I had to take freshman year. Renzi is tough but very reasonable he doesn't hand out As but the TAs usually have your back. The readings were hard but super interesting
Vincent Renzi was one of the biggest disappointments that I have had at NYU. Don't take him unless you want to tank your GPA.
Brilliant guy, extremely knowledgeable and he knows that he knows more than you do about the subject. If you are active he will like you and then will help the course fit you. So far, my favorite professor at NYU
Rude, unhelpful, full of himself. I do not recommend him.
Teacher name: Jones Jr.
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
The only people that complain about Jones are the ones who get bad grades because they didnt work hard enough. I got near 100s on the exams just from grinding through all the problems/past exams he provided us with. Go to his Q&amp;A sessions or ask him questions after lecture, hes not intimidating at all and is willing to help.
If you don't think Jones is unnecessarily hard then go look at other school's Orgo exams. They aren't even close to the difficulty of Jones' exams. Orgo itself does not have any difficult concepts, but his exams and grading will make you feel stupid. You have to hope you nail the right concept on his questions because he doesn't give partial credit
This man is very smart and is very good at lecturing. But my god, his tests are extremely difficult. If you want to do well you must go to lecture, read the textbook, do practice problems, and do past exams. But even still his class is challenge and will cause you to spend sleepless nights studying. Be prepared for a challenge.
Hardest class I've ever taken in my life. This class has pushed me to study in ways I never thought I could (8+ hours a day for a week straight before the exam). Exams are insanely difficult, but not impossible. Everything learned in lecture is just the basics. you need to spend a lot of extra time at home doing every practice problem you can find.
Lecture is based on the textbook so it is entirely possible to never go to class and still get an A, however you'd be doing yourself a great disservice because Jones is a great lecturer. Students complain about Jones because the class is hard and not because he is a bad lecturer. He gives you the framework, you have to learn and apply it.
This guy knows his stuff and does an excellent job of conveying the critical concepts and problems you will encounter in his lectures. However the difficult and expansive nature of the material means that this is a tough class. keep up with the readings, attend all lectures, do practice problems regularly and expect his tests to be TOUGH, but fair.
Professor Jones is very intelligent and definitely knows his materials. However, he's horrible at presenting the materials when it comes to his lectures. I learned more from recitation than lecture and he gives no partial credits on exams. The average for the first exam was a 49 and he blamed the students for their "all-time low" performance.
I found it really difficult to learn with him because of how fast-paced the course was. Instead of explaining concepts, he was very example-based and didn't adequately outline exceptions to the rules - he simply expects all his students to be geniuses. VERY test heavy and, since tests are only a few questions, it is difficult to do well.
Some students dislike MJ. I find him sincere, albeit demanding. Lectures cover the basics, and tests are very difficult. As such, you are forced to learn independently. It's a skill-based course - do the online practice problems and as many practice exams as you can, with time leading up to testing, and you will perform well. Textbook is secondary.
Super disorganized and poor at explaining concepts. Definitely would not recommend. He is the type to ask questions during lecture about things being taught for the first time, get annoyed when people don't know the answer, refuse to go on until someone volunteers, and get even more annoyed that the answer was wrong.
One of the toughest professors at NYU.  He REALLY emphasizes applying concepts - understand the material and do every practice exam you can find, memorizing won't cut it.  He's intimidating, but also an invaluable resource and an exceptional teacher.  Orgo hurt my GPA, but I really do have a greater understanding of chemistry thanks to him.
srsly, most brilliant prof I've had.  majors or reg orgo, def take him.  he's not easy at all and can be a v obnoxious figure during the year, but in the end you'll appreciate learning orgo from him specifically. do literally every question of his, textbook or prac exams, promise it's worth it.  also see tom, he's basically psychic w exam q's.
Dr. Jones is one of the greatest lecturers at NYU. Orgo I was an incredibly difficult course, and while the material covered in Orgo II is objectively harder, the smaller class size and access to practice problems made it much more fun! If you want to get the A in Orgo, attend every lecture + Tom's review, do practice problems and PAST EXAMS!
I made the mistake of taking him for both Organic Chemistry I and II. If you can avoid, do not hesitate. The material he teaches is irrelevant to tests. Instead, you have to analyze concepts through problems yourself
Jones is incredibly difficult. He will push you harder than you've ever been pushed. You HAVE to work hard, and you HAVE to study. But he gives you a truly deep understanding of the subject and you will walk out of this class proud of your grade.
The class is difficult, no doubt. But he is the best of the best. know one knows their stuff like prof Jones.
No partial credit. Strict grading criteria. Tests are based on picking up patterns from problems, not lectures. Regardless lectures are presented sloppily. Doesn't care. Avoid
Complicates things
if you do not want to study 10 hours a day to pass then don't take his class
do not take him! No partial credit on test questions; either you get it or not.
Teacher name: Paizis, Andrew
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Worst Professor I have had at NYU
Very boring lectures, he reads the PowerPoint that came with the textbook and thats it. Grade was based almost entirely on 3 tests. He was very monotone and made the class awful as he just read the screen with only some extra content.
Paizis is the best!!!! He is always hilarious!!!dont know why people just dont come to the class:( The exam is a little bit hard but if you work hard, A-should be easy. And he takes clicker points really serious, so make sure you come to the class with clicker:) Enjoy his cute accent!
Heard really good things about Paizis- thought he was an amazing lecturer but turns out he was just good at creating a very structured class. Very by the book kind of person but he is def passionate about what he does &amp; spams your emails w memes, comics and news over the weekend at 3am. Grades are all exams &amp; homework which are all multiple choice
Paizis has very clear expectations from the get-go. Slides are all you need to study, no need for textbook or lectures tbh. But OCC is a very qualitative class and his exams are all MCQs, so get ready to cram tons of info into your brain if you want a good grade. It's interesting and easy content but you will have to make an effort for an A.
This class was the worst class to take freshman fall semester. The lectures are at 8 am on Mondays and Wednesdays. Paizis is very monotone and basically reads a powerpoint. If you do not read, you will not pass. Also, he is not accessible at all outside of class. If you are not an Econ major, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.
I have had Dr. Paizis twice now, and he is one of the most clear and excellent professors I have ever had. He asks the class after about every five slides if everything is clear, and if there are any questions. If you don't want to ask your question in class, go see him in his office, where he'll also welcome you with open arms. HIGHLY recommend.
He is probably one of the most respected econ professors around and states exactly what he expects from students on the very first day of class. Keeps checking in on students throughout the class to make sure that no one has any questions. He also sends a ton of e-mails with writings and comics, which, if read, help students understand the topic.
Bad lectures. Frequently cancel his office hours, even before the final exam.
As someone who is not into econ at all, I surprisingly well! Just study a normal amount, and go to lecture if you want a breakdown. All tests are multiple choice. Paizis is a funny dude, but if you don't like getting 10 emails a day, maybe take someone else.
It is composed of three exams that take up 85% in total. However, the tests are not that hard and there's no essays. Clickers are used so attendance is mandatory. Aplia is used for hw. The questions aren't hard, but every attempt is counted toward the final score. His lectures have a lot of Simpsons component. He emails a lot -- a lot.
His lectures are not very productive. Everyone would skip his class because you get far more from reading the textbook. Recitation is utterly useless. Exams are not very difficult. Study the tables in your textbook and understand how to do the FEW equations per graph for they will be on exams.
He is HILARIOUS. He is really good at teaching. Material is always well prepared. Wonder why lots of people don't come to the class. i would definitely take him again.
Great professor. It is important to be present at the lectures regularly, as you receive a participation point for the clickers grade. There are regular online homework assignments. The exams are not curved, but there is no need if you study and understand the material - all questions are extremely straightforward. It is important to read the text.
The class is difficult due to the fact that it's based on 3 exams and small participation (clickers)/homework grade. Homework is fairly easy to get an A average. Tests are multiple choice so they aren't too bad but it's easy to get low grades. Paizis is clear and humorous in lectures + encourages questions despite it being a 500 person lecture
Only 17-19% students gets A range (so A and A-). Do not understand why he has high ratings. Terrible lectures where you learn nothing from and no practice problems at all except homework problems from Aplia. He's busy because he teach at other places too. No office hours. TAs are not helpful.
His lectures are so bad! He uses these slides generated by the book company that pays him, which are extremely boring and poorly constructed. He is ridiculously unfair with grades and rounds it down no matter what. He's also hard on attendance and drops your grade for the most ridiculous excuses.
Really awesome professor with a ton of passion for the material and the students.
I enjoyed his lecture but his exams were confusing. He would also curve strictly according to his ridiculous distribution. Worked so hard but it's impossible to get an A.
Paizis is the man. He plays clips from the Simpsons, South Park etc. occasionally to illustrate economic concepts. He sends lots of emails with Econ jokes/comics which are insightful. When you email him, he responds promptly and always tries his best to help. Lectures are kinda boring at times. Clickers questions are kinda hard but tests are easy.
Teacher name: Adler, Andre
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is the best science professor that I have had as a pre-health student. Although class size is huge, he is always willing to help after lecture or during office hours and clearly wants the best for his students. Make sure to review lecture practice problems as well as the ones from the textbook and homeworks.
super easy class (in history of NYU) but apparently only for students taking his class in fall 2018 and spring 2019!!
This class has apparently gotten tougher in recent years but as far as classical physics goes, Andre is a great lecturer. HW and Lab work is a time sink but is good prep for the exams (all multiple choice). Study the HW questions and the in class questions, exams are cake.
He is the best professor. I am glad to have had him for physics because I learned a lot. He is very nice and his office hours are VERY helpful. He even sets up recitation days where he comes in to help his students- very caring. Thankful for such a great professor.
Very boring class and students sleep in his class. If you memorize like a robot you can actually get a good grade. His exams are very easy. You can participate in learning catalytics session from home.
The sweetest man. Makes me love physics. He would do anything to help you understand physics. Really good at explaining things so go meet with him if you are confused.
Professor Adler is *by far* the sweetest, most caring professor I have ever had the privilege of working with. He legit wanted to make my life easier, even when it meant more work for him. Do the assigned problems and you should be more than fine. Professor Adler is incredible! Don't confuse hared of physics with hatred for him..
Professor Adler is very caring and helpful. You can do well if you study and practice!
Your grade is indicative of the effort you put in towards the class. If you go to lecture, keep up with the readings, and do all of the homework you WILL receive an A. However this is easier said than done, as many people in this class will agree with. Adler is a friendly professor and is there to help, but at the end of the day, you must try.
I really thought Physics would be better than hs, but its all the same thing. I really wish I learned something but all I did was memorize since the first exam incentivized memorization over actual learning. Wish i was better at memorizing.
Just do the homework and know how to do the in class problems, there's no reason not to get a high grade in this class
DO NOT TAKE GENERAL PHYSICS UNLESS U HAVE TO! its a painfully boring class that taught me next to nothing. Adler is not a bad instructor but this course is awful and big (500+ students big). I did enjoy the lab component though..
For general physics, just read the textbook, do the homework problems, and there is no reason not to get a high grade. Literally every test problem is taken from some form of homework. If you've ever taken any sort of physics before, it will be very easy. If not, the textbook is more straightforward than the lectures, and you should still be fine.
Many complain that Prof Adler is either too boring or gives exams that are too hard. Attending lecture isn't a necessity since one can participate in the learning catalytics session from home, and the questions on the exams are taken directly from the homework he assigns and from the practice problems seen throughout the text. An A- is v. realistic
Do the work and really no reason for you to not get a good grade.
Such a fair grader, I love him! I definitely don't think this class is an easy A. However as long as you do all of the problems he assigns, and review both the homework and in class problems before each exam, you should be able to get at least an A-. I recommend taking him for sure.
Professor Adler provides many opportunities to learn the material. If you do every practice problem that he provides and you understand the theory behind each answer, getting an A should be no problem. People complain that his tests are difficult, but they are completely fair if you do the practice. He is also super sweet and hilarious in lecture.
Best professor I've ever had! He's really passionate about the subject and truly wants his students to succeed. He's super responsive to emails and will really work with you if you reach out to him.
Imagine you're Jon Snow going against Ramsay Bolton's army without the help of Littlefinger. Yeah, that's what taking his multiple choice exams feel like.
Multiple choice leaves little room for partial credit. His exams are kind of unpredictable, he repeats questions for some and none for others. He should probably record lecture.
Teacher name: Kitsikopoulos, Harry
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Very good professor. Teach economics not just based on textbook. Lectures are stimulating. Tests are not hard if you are willing to think. Would recommend.
I wouldn't take it again!
Although I am not a Economics major, I enjoyed this class a lot. Harry was very clear at his explanations and would not mind to repeat unclear concepts. Honestly, I dislike his arrogant attitude. CLASS STRUCTURE: Final grade is NOT curved, so you better work hard for an A. This class is based on 3 exams for which each question is worth 1 point.
Explains concepts clearly - but goes really slow. Useful for students who aren't used to economics concepts but unbearably boring to sit in lectures where he panders to students like we're kids. Grading system is ridiculous - one point  one percent. Some questions on tests are vaguely framed, meant to trick you, and other answers often have merit.
Kits isn't helpful at all. The tests aren't that hard, but you will NEED to study by the book. He barely covers any of the material in each chapter. Again, not that difficult, but you MUST STUDY BY THE BOOK.
By far worst economics professor of all time. Test are not hard but his lectures are useless. scares people that the test is coming from the lectures but it did not happen once. Everything comes out of textbook. Arrogant and always complaining. In this way, he never builds any bonds with students. Doesnt try to listen to us. bet my life on my rate.
There were only three assignments for this class - three tests that add up to 100 points. These are incredibly easy if you read the book and attend (at least some) lectures. Professor is a cool dude and makes the lectures entertaining. Really good for an intro level course.
Pretty decent class. Grading set-up is simple: every point you get wrong on the tests is a point off your average. Tests are heavily based on the textbook so if you read them closely you'll be okay, even if you miss class. The professor is entertaining and makes concepts clear and memorable. Accent was sometimes distracting, not unbearable though.
This guy is the hardest grader you will ever have for a class with essays in it. But his lectures are engaging and eye-opening. He takes economic ideas and applies them to comment on society and how (he believes) it should be fixed. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken here. But this is NOT an easy class. I barely passed.
Prof Kitsikopoulus is funny, knows his stuff and most importantly is a great teacher. He conducts class in an engaging way, encourages participation and uses real world examples to explain the concepts. Tests are tough but you learn a lot. This was definitely one of my favorite classes because of Kitz
Grade is derived from  a total of 100 questions over 3 exams. Solid A is less than 6 wrong. Getting an A- is VERY easy, but getting an A is very tough. You must read the book (there are a couple fact based questions each test that are only found in book). The questions are designed to trick you, pay attention to wording. Great professor, engaging.
Kitz is da man! He is extremely funny and explains subject material well using a great amount of detail and relatable examples, so go to class! Downside, he only has three exams that count for the whole class &amp; they're super tricky! So, pay attention in class and make sure you get the book!!
awful
super awesome prof, just be sure to read the textbook. talks about relevant current events which helps a lot
Kitsikopoulos is a great professor &amp; lecturer. He is very entertaining and tells funny jokes during class. He is also easy to approach with questions.  The only thing is that grades a 100% based off exams, and the final exam was really difficult (average final exam score of fall 2013 was about 71%).
Great guy, good at taking care of those kids who try to show off. His grading system is ridiculous and the material is hard. If you want to do well, read the textbook and go to lecture. If you can't bring yourself to do either, drop the course. Not worth the stress.
He's a funny guy and a good professor, but his grading system is killer. You can only get 6 questions wrong throughout the semester to get an A (which I was one away from getting...)
One of the easiest Econ classes at NYU. He is entertaining during lecture and I learned a lot. If you dislike this class or find it hard then its a good indication you shouldn't be an econ major. There were three exams and each one got more challenging, but overall the class was pretty easy.
The materials are not that hard, but it is the way he chooses to grade that drops most people's grade. If you made one mistake on one of the exams, you lose one point on your final grade. I studied a lot and ended up with an A-, but I am pretty sure those who get As do not necessarily know much better than I do. I did enjoy his lectures though.
I was hestitant to take this class but his lectures were really clear and helpful. Its important to read the book but in class he emphasizes important parts you may have skimmed over when reading. Grading scale is awesome- 75 is a B. Pretty good prof overall
Teacher name: Rectenwald, Michael
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Rectenwald was by far my favorite teacher of my first semester at NYU. He inspired my fellow classmates and myself to think outside of the box. His grading criteria is explained and extremely fair. He is very understanding and in the end wants each student to learn. Love him and glad to have him again next semester.
Professor Rec is such an Angel. Always hold class on Google handout when you don't want to go to class. TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT TO HAVE CLASS ON THE INTERNET. Just turn off the camera and microphone and enjoy his smile. Homework is basically some interesting readings and it's fine if you don't read them at all.
Dr. Rec is truly an amazing prof. I've never had another teacher who meets with each student individually and gives line by line feedback on their essays before they're due. Most of my profs won't even read my essays let alone give feedback. I feel like my writing did genuinely improve under his instruction.
Terrible.
If you're thinking of the MCC major take him! Great dude, super intelligent but sort of crazy. He does class online via google hangouts sometimes. I loved the readings but they can be long and difficult. A blog is due every couple of weeks, theres about 4-5 papers but he allows you to meet with him and he will give you feedback and he's easy grader
Very rigorous, and even more engaging. Highly sympathetic to personal issues, great guy all around. Always the most interesting and carefully chosen material to read and write about, and he manages to sprinkle humor into our discussions. Never mind being the best professor in LS, Rectenwald might be the best prof. at NYU.
Extremely rewarding writing class that has changed my entire academic career. Would not have made it w/o mike
Dr. Rec is without a doubt one of my favorite professors at NYU. Even if you disagree with his views (Like most of the class) you simply must admire him for being so understanding and helpful. He is flexible, gives out extensions, and his focus is teaching how technology has affected our society, with many dense, but enlightening readings. Worth it
Dr. Rec is a great professor. He cares about his students, is always available to give feedback, and is very lenient about deadlines and grading. You don't necessarily have to come to class, but I would because I would leave mind-blown pretty often. Not your conventional writing class, but I liked that a lot.
Dr. Rectenwald will physically edit your first drafts with you and he is very caring towards his students. He has pretty lenient deadlines. He's a great writing professor because he encourages you to open your mind about modern topics. His grading is pretty easygoing and he doesn't give below a B plus if you try. Take him. He is awesome. .
This guy is brave, inspirational, and honest. So many professors have adopted a singular idea and are unwilling to speak their mind.  Rechtenwald is different.  I encourage anyone who values critical thinking to study under him.
LOVE HIM! Take him if you have the chance to! He's a really inspiring professor especially for writing. The topic for essays is basically technology. He loves technology and everything is electronic (except text book). Dont really have to work if you really dont want to,  but I highly recommend to take his class seriously because its really helpful
DrRec is the reason I signed up for Rate My Professors because I really love him as my writing professor. He is a mad genius type of person and teaches a lot other than writing skills. He once reproduced the class for me because I missed the class. He's very responsible and definitely knows perfectly about what he's teaching.
Dr. Rec is fantastic. Know that he focuses on 'academic writing'- contemparary topics opposed to creative writing (this actually helps a lot for other classes). If not doing poetry like some of your friends are is okay with you, he's an unregretable choice. Manageable and clear workload. If you do what he asks and try, you'll get a great grade too
Simply put, Rec is a genius, and onto something, just does not necessarily know how to make it more difficult.  Does not make him a bad professor, actually he's amazing, but his class is definitely not the hardest Ive ever taken...
Eclectic, mad-genius type of guy. The papers he assign may be long and sometimes dry, but the in-class discussions are amazing. DONT BE AFRAID TO TALK! This is a good class to just open up and bounce around ideas. Not really a writing class, since you have so much creative liberty. Take this class just to become a smarter person.
Professor Rectenwald is the coolest writing instructor I've ever met!
This professor was very kind throughout the entire semester, he was very clear about expectations. The class was not easy, but was very interesting. The professor only choice topics that he knew would interest students, and students opinions were more than welcomed.  I would recommend that anyone considering taking Writing 1 take this class.
Professor Rectenwald and his course are absolutely amazing.  You read about engaging and modern topics which make you think hard and want to dig deeper.  Our "roundtable" in-class discussions are open and stimulating.  Writing assignments require thought and allow much freedom of content.  By far the best prof and course I've ever had.  TAKE HIM.
Dr. Rectenwald introduced a lot of information about modern life dealing with technology which taught me a lot and was a nice break from all the ancient text common in the other freshman required courses. You have to do the homework and reading to understand and pass the class but it was worth it cause the material was actually interesting.
Teacher name: Barna, John
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
DO NOT TAKE if you don't love culture things and these books. He has extra class which will influence your grade, and his study guide is horribly tough, though u can pass exams with study guide.
He's caring, very lenient with deadlines. He gives you a study guide for the exam with the questions related to the exam. Class is very relaxed, you don't need to participate and he talks a lot. You don't need to take a lot of notes in class.
great professor, talks a lot in class, does not care if you listen or not. one of the best in nyu
Definitely taking Barna again. Very understanding if you ever needed an extension or missed a class for something important. If you were late and spoke to him after class about it he'd usually just mark you as "present. " He gave study guides that could be filled out and used on midterm/final which were very easy but very long. No one really read.
Barna is the best professor at NYU! Easiest A and a great class to catch up on your sleep. Take him!
Barna's a legend - TAKE HIM!! Play for his intramural team/talk to him about sportsA. His lectures are quite useless so use them as a study hall. Midterm and finals are long but you get a study guide - and NOTHING else comes. In fact, u can even meet him outside class and he'll help u fill the whole study guide! He's the easiest professor at NYU.
Barna is the easiest A you'll ever recieve. Sweet guy and means well but if you actually want to learn something do NOT take him. Also trying to stay awake during his lectures proves incredibly difficult.
Living legend. Show up to class, fill out the study guides that you get to use on the exams and you will get an A.  He's the easiest teacher at nyu.
He is genuinely very kind. He rambles off topic a lot; read and teach yourself and be up to date with booksHe is very lenient on work, I turned in everything on the last day of class. Literally just go to class do not skip and just talk to him time to time and you will probably get an A-. if you discuss in class (literally anything) he'll love you.
He is truly an "old fashioned" professor.  If you take him, prepare to have 2 very long midterms, but he gives you them beforehand and lets you take them with the test. Definitely do not wait to the last night to fill them out and you will be more than OK. I love JB and if you can manage your time you will as well.
I thought I would be able to sit through his long, boring,  useless, and off-topic lectures all semester for the easy A, but I was terribly mistaken. I did not learn a single useful thing, and to top it off, he EXPECTS  you to attend extra classes OUTSIDE of the normal class schedule at the end of the year because of his disorganization.
Professor Barna is a nice guy who is passionate about classic literature. His lectures can get so far off topic, however, that sometimes it feels as though he's really rushing through material. He spent the first two classes of the semester telling us how "different" he is from every other professor at NYU... which is what every professor thinks.
Such a nice guy. Very clear on his expectations and a fair grader. He is always willing to help and will make sure you understand all material before a midterm or final. Interesting lectures and great professor overall. Highly recommended
His midterm is 4 hours long. His final is 6 hours long. NOT A JOKE. He NEVER stays on topic. If you're an athlete, you will DEFINITELY get an A. I feel bad because he seems to genuinely care about his students but at the same time -- all his attempts backfire and make the lives of his students a lot harder. Don't take him, please.
He is a really nice guy. He will give you review guide for exams, and during the exams, you are allowed to look at your notes on the review guide. He is sentimental but super friendly. Attendance seems to be mandatory, but he doesn't really care as long as you give him valid explanations for your abscence. I will definitely take him again!!!!!
Boring, disorganized lectures. I really recommend you don't take him.
Very disorganized and pretty incapable of staying on topic. Doesn't make it through a lot of the syllabus. As long as you read what he assigns, put in minimal effort, and participate once or twice in class so he knows your name, you are going to get an A
Really just a wonderful man who wants his students to learn. Can get boring at times, so try to start discussions with him and you'll be amazed at how interesting it can turn out to be. Great overall professor.
He is the man, works diligently, goes through great material, and funny!
His teaching style is not for all but all can succeed. Class can be rowdy and repetitive. The 3 papers are of little importance. Show effort on those, but don't kill yourself. Through the midterm and final he will see how well you listened in class and grade you on that. Easy A IF you do the work, as he says. As a person he is passionate and kind.
Teacher name: Rajsingh, Peter
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Challenging but worth it in every regard. A true gem. Try to never miss class.
Got an A: go to EVERY lecture &amp; take verbatim notes (the open-note MC has the same language he uses in lecture; I got a lot of questions right b/c I had the answer word-for-word in my notes). Contrary to popular opinion, it's possible to get an A w/o getting to know him personally/going to office hours (I never did). Challenging prof, but worth it.
Honestly, I love Prof. Rajsingh. I took his Amcon class and have systematically made PR one of my closest mentors and friends at the university. He's not only open and genuine, he's understanding and caring and when you connect with him he really stops at nothing to help you succeed. I cannot recommend him enough. He's an amazing man.
Peter is the kind of professor I had hoped to encounter during my time at NYU - a brilliant mind and person that clarifies the most dense of topics. His 104 question midterm was tough. He definitely doesn't dole out A's. If you are looking for an "easy" class with a nonchalant professor, this class is not for you.
Really enjoyed this professor and this class.  Material and tests are VERY challenging. But got a lot out of every class. Beware he cold calls and does not just dole out A's.
Hands down the best prof at NYU. Learned so much. Class emphasis is on gaining deeper knowledge and understanding. He explains things so clearly using great analogies. Also, helps you learn to read and write  in a more sophisticated way.  Randomly cold calls which is a bit terrifying. But he's all round  super nice guy. Highly recommend!
Of all the professors at NYU, none stand out to the extent Rajsingh does.  He is beyond brilliant not just in terms of what he knows but, more importantly, in terms of how he develops your critical perception and understanding of the world.  He also makes great strides, both in and out of the classroom, to ensure his students success.  Amazing!
Students ask him to repeat questions/statements/definitions 2-3 times, and rather than trying to come up with a different, better way to explain something, he just says it again slowly. He doesn't motivate you to do the reading or come to class prepared, so every kid he calls from the class list just reads from Oyez. He knows; he just doesn't care.
Amazing class with emphasis on learning not memorising (tests all open book but super challenging) and takes understanding to another level. Interesting discussions, though some students try to dominate. He does a good job giving a variety of students airtime. Large lecture hall but feels like a seminar.  Randomly cold calls so you can't be timid.
Peter is the best professor at NYU. He's actually one of the most fun, genuine, cool people to get to know and taking his classes has been one of the great joys of my academic career here. I cannot stress this enough, if you do not take his class and really try to get to know him you've done NYU wrong.   Also super hot.
Amazing class! I learnt so much about the US constitution. Grading scheme is a black box. Best to work hard on each quiz and do really well in the final hypothetical too. He likes to see a positive uptrend in the grades.   He is very willing to help out students as well. If you are unclear about anything, just ask him.
Need to work hard and be sharp about details to get an A.  Class really makes you think. Also keeps you on your toes. Learned so much in this class and from this professor and feel much smarter for having taken this class.
I missed a few of the lectures and was still fine. He puts students on the spot in class by calling out from an attendance sheet, which can be a bit intimidating. He is brilliant and very mysterious. Do a good job on the final hypothetical and you will be ok!! I did poorly on the first one but still ended up with a B+ in the class.
You will have times in this class that you think that you're way over your head, but he assures you that the purpose of the class is not to know everything but to stretch your mind and that's what education should be. Amazingly bright and interesting professor. Challenging but so rewarding if you put in the time.  This class is a must-take.
Really awesome lecturer, and a great class
Absolute best professor I've had at NYU. He's extremely intelligent and his lectures are interesting. However, his class is extremely hard and often understanding the material does not guarantee a good grade.
Amazing professor. He is funny, engaging and very smart. The midtermsfinals are tough though but most of us made it out alive. Highly recommended!!
Peter is an incredible professor, extremely interesting and well-spoken.. never looked forward to a class as much as i did his
He is amazing! He wants you to work hard for your grade though. This class requires a good amount of studyingreading time outside of class. I would definitely recommend him but I will also say that if you don't understand something, ASK HIM! He does not mind explaining something until you get it.
Great class! Super challenging and you'll probably fail the midterm. Most of us did, but we still made it out with decent grades. Prof. Rajsingh is so cool and he wants you to learn and succeed not just pass a class as long as you show real effort, you'll definitely pass.He's also super chill. MAKE SURE YOU ATTEND LECTURE. You'll be lost w.o it.
Teacher name: Regan, Ward
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
The best ever!!!!!!
One of the most intelligent, genuinely funny professors on campus. You have to work for a good grade, but it's totally worth the effort. Classes are entertaining and engaging, and he connects everything he talks about in really interesting ways. If you aren't afraid to read or work hard on your writing, definitely take his class.
just amazing.
Regan's class holds you to a higher standard of awareness regarding current events and socioeconomic realities. The texts primarily serve as philosophic touchstones, which provide different perspectives on our current political moment. Making connections is key. Do not expect summaries. He is always on time, engaged &amp; obscenely well read. Take!
Professor Regan is an extremely intelligent, funny man. His lectures almost never have anything to do with the assignment at hand. The few papers that are assigned seem to be graded somewhat arbitrarily. But email him your papers before you hand them in and he'll tell you exactly what he wants and how to edit. Take purely for entertainment value.
Here's the thing about Prof. Regan - very rarely are his lectures in their entirety about the subject at hand. Often they devolve into interesting but ultimately irrelevant current affairs discussions. If you are going to take his class, you need to accept that the lectures are not really going to be about the course, and catch up outside class.
Quite honestly, he's awful. He never discusses the readings, holds you after class, offers no grading criterion and then won't hear you out when you offer opinions that contradict his own. There is no structure to his class, he just doles out grades on a whim. Do not recommend.
If you need clear direction in your class, don't take him.  He'll seem crazy and off topic, but he'll make you think about what he's teaching and what's going on in the world in new ways. Be patient and he'll eventually connect back to the topic and the readings.  Just be willing to learn and have ACTUAL intellectual conversations.  Read the books.
very engaging lectures, manageable homework, mostly reading and writing
Very passionate and knowledgeable about politics. Took current events and connected them to historical texts - sometimes it was a stretch, but always interesting. Absolutely hilarious, but tough grader. Write to the maximum requirement to get an A. Participation is a must. Would take again.
Prof. Regan is super cool in the way he teaches. He's very informal in his lectures and talks about current issues for the majority of the class, but he also knows how to relate it to the course work very well! I'm taking him again next semester, not the easiest grader but has reasonable expectations! Take him!
The best professor at NYU, I learned so much from his class. Can be a tough grader, but so incredibly worth it
One of the most stubborn professors I have ever had. He acts very down to earth and seems chill, but he has really firm views that if you dispute, he fights you on them. His lectures are mostly monologues and doesn't respect other student's opinions. Lectures rarely have to do with the readings, as he mostly talks about current events. Don't Take
We spent our time discussing things that happened in the news and connecting them to the tenets of the course. Regan makes his leftist beliefs abundantly clear in his lectures, which are often cliche and questionable but nobody debates with him because he is cute. Every week he assigns long and difficult readings that are discussed but not tested.
Regan is the man. His lectures are interesting and varied. "Theology is a lot like fan fiction" was the basis of one class. 45 minutes each day talking current events and then we somehow relate it to the course material which doesn't feel rushed at all. Start working on the term paper early, or you'll regret it.
TOOK him for sf1,2 and 3 , he is the best professor at nyu. Extremely helpful, lets you pursue your own interests , keeps the class very interesting .... Take him definitely you will never get a better professor
Regan is the greatest Professor in the history of Professorship! The class was laid back, and yet will change the way you look at everything. He is very Liberal, curses a lot, but says plenty of good things. Most of the class is spent on discussing current events which is very interesting. Overall, this class was one of the best I've taken at NYU.
Best professor I have ever had
His discussions were boring to me- all he seemed to talk about were current events during the whole lecture, and nothing seemed to pertain to the class.  Also curses a lot, which can be a little irritating.  There is no midterm, but 2 short essays, 1 final term paper, and a take home final, which is nice.
I have enough trouble with philosophy as it is. The fact that he spends all of class ranting about religion did not help me understand the essay prompts any better. He also gave better paper grades to students who debated with him in class. Also, do not buy books from the place he suggests. Buy them online!! I was RIPPEDOFF
Teacher name: Andersen, Susan
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
best professor ever, detailed oriented, patient, always takes time to explain my questions, best mentor ever.
I kept hearing that this was the hardest undergraduate psychology class at NYU, but most of the difficulty was in her lecture. She doesn't use powerpoints, so most of the class is her going off on random tangents that made it harder to take cohesive notes. Do good on the midterms and final and you should be fine.
She lectures without powerpoints so you have to make sure to write everything she says down, cant skip lectures. The textbook should be used but the lectures are not based off on it. So tests are on text,lecture, and assigned readings. Writing assignment which is worth a test grade. She is really nice and curves the tests a little bit.
To understand the material and perform well in the class, you have to actually attend lecture and pay attention. (SHOCKING, I know!) However, Professor Andersen makes it easy to do that; she's very knowledgeable, awkwardly funny and engaging. If you're uninterested in the material, lazy and prefer memorizing slides, do not take this class.
andersen is a real gem-a wonderful caring person, and the material in personality is so fascinating! it's actually very easy to get an A bc her lectures require your engagement, and the readings really aren't hard- they're SO interesting. ended up w/a higher grade in this class than any other class bc she curves exams generously
So. Prof. Andersen is a wonderful person. She is incredibly intelligent, but Personality was unreasonably difficult due to the amount of material crammed into one semester. The reading is excessive and there are no powerpoints in lecture and if youre like me its hard to focus on someone talking for an hour and a half. Still like her though.
Please please do not take this class! She begun the class saying it would be "very hard" and I realised through the course that its due to the disorganization and tangential nature of the lectures. I was incredibly engaged with the material, its all very interesting, but the main takeaway from the class was understanding Andersen, not the material.
many students expect information to be fed to them, which doesn't happen here. this is the best class i've ever taken and dr. andersen is a really wonderful human - caring, hilarious, and understanding on top of being a total genius. her lectures are mind-blowing &amp; it's easy to get an A if you just listen,which is easy bc the material's fascinating
I don't understand why there's so much negative feedback on Andersen. I think people are so used to having slides to copy, but Andersen doesn't use slides, therefore you're required to really focus to understand her lectures and to be able to take notes. As a result, I actually *understood* the material rather and the rest followed, including my A.
Whole grade is just a couple of tests and a paper. Really pay attention in class and read the book. She is extremely smart and sometimes its hard to follow.
Mind-blowing class, Dr. Andersen is THE BEST - she is caring, supportive and really knowledgeable. Learned more in this class than all of my other psych classes combined. Not difficult, just keep up with the readings
Dr. Andersen is by far the most inspirational, caring, passionate, professor I've ever had and Personality was the best, most useful class I've ever taken. Her lectures are hilarious and engaging - she really knows her stuff and wants us to understand everything. Pay attention and read and you'll do really well.
Prof. Andersen is perhaps the best example of the scatterbrain academic who sweeps student's questions/concerns under the rug in favor of her pursuit to further her career. If you make the mistake of taking her class, you better be fast to befriend the TA.
Read the textbook, go to lecture and you will be just fine! Andersen's lectures can be dry sometimes but she's really sweet, brilliant and has the best dry humor. The class was tough but manageable -- my TA Laura is an absolute angel and is so helpful! Definitely go to her review sessions, work hard and you'll get an A. Such an interesting class.
This is a TON of content, but it's not difficult content. Just a lot. The exams are hard, but if you do the readings and GO TO LECTURE you're fine. Pro tips: write down EVERY word she says in lecture. Make sense of it later. Combine notes with friends. She's SO rambly but then TESTS you on the ramblings, so you DON'T want to miss anything.
If you can avoid it, do not take this course. You have to attend all lectures and complete all textbook reading plus all 20 page articles. The theories she teaches are outdated &amp; she focusses on Freud for a whole month. She's an established researcher but not a good teacher. I have not learned anything new that I didn't learn in Intro to Psych
Not only is the content of the course hard, Andersen doesn't make it any easier by not posting any of the notes or assignments online. You need to write down everything she says in lecture or you'll miss material. Also need to read about 20 research papers on top of the textbook and the lecture notes for the final. Not worth it for how hard it is.
I took this class in 2000 &amp; remember her as one of the most fascinating teachers I had. Engaging lectures. Part of your experience of her classes may depend on the TA due to there being extra study sessions with them (if the format hasn't changed). That's the one thing I wasn't thrilled with. As others said, be interested in the subject matter.
This was hands down the worst class I've taken. Andersen can't seem to stay on track or get her points out in a clear and concise manner, so lectures are extremely frustrating and almost always run over time. In addition to tedious and repetitive lectures, she also assigns mountains of tedious and repetitive reading.
Dr. Andersen is a very kind person. She expects studiousness from her students, but she is fair in the way she tests and interacts with us. She gives tests that are thorough but fair, and if you study hard, you'll do absolutely fine. Some people thing she's too though, but those people don't expect to try hard in their classes.
Teacher name: Pataki, Louis
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Prof Pataki is very kind and is just overall a caring person...I cant say that I really enjoyed his class because I *had* to take it for a science credit. Despite that, as long as you take notes and do well on the group projects and labs, it is an easy A. He is a pretty funny guy with lots of stories to tell.
A kind man that likes telling random stories while lecturing. His slides/lectures are pretty vague seems like he expects prior astronomy knowledge. Grades essays/labs lightly. Will deduct points if he sees that you are not in class, I had mostly As on his assignments/exams got a B-, i think that's why i got a deduction; he never answered my email
Often disorganized and gets confused easily. The main project consists of 3 essays 4-6 pages long. Wouldn't be too bad if his lectures weren't confusing. His grading criteria doesn't make sense either. Name-drops often too. Not really accessible during office hours either. Wasn't the worst teacher I've ever had but not the best either.
Really nice and understanding.
He pretty much just lectures, which is so boring. But, if you ay attention you will get an easy A. Turn in your labs and you will be fine, he does grade these a little harder than expected. He posts all the lectures online so you don't even have to go to class.
Honestly,  he's a great guy! Gave me a B+ even though my midterm and finals were both a C-. Make sure you do as many papers as you can if you aren't good at this class. Try and stay on top of your work or you will easily fall behind.
dont blink-- youll fall behind
Pataki is very passionate about astronomy. He does lecture often so it gets boring sometimes. You should purchase the textbook if science and/or math is not your best subject. You MUST study for the midterm and final because it's very challenging. If you go to office hours Pataki will definitely help you!
Professor Pataki is a very nice and extremely knowledgable professor. Has great stories from his experience in the field. This class was a bit difficult since I'm not a science major but it was not too challenging. He lectures a lot but if you take notes and pay attention, you'll do fine in the class.
Louis Pataki is an astronomy expert. If you care about the subject, you'll appreciate that. If you don't, you might be frustrated and confused and should take someone else. His class notes aren't the most concise but you'll know what to study. Most of the work is completing lab questions at home. Midterm and final aren't too bad if you study hard.
Professor Pataki is THE sweetest man. For the most part, he clearly explains topics and ideas explicitly how they appear on his (very easy) tests. He is always available to help and genuinely wants you to succeed. He is a very lenient grader. His stories are often first or second-hand; take this class to learn astronomy from a true astronomer.
He's a good guy, but this class is supposed to be designed for students who aren't majoring in the sciences nor do they particularly excel in them, and I feel like this is often forgotten. The class isn't particularly difficult, yet the midterm and final are. Lectures are helpful, but sometimes a little too anecdotal.
If you need to get your science requirement out of the way (like I did as a liberal studies major), history of the universe is the class to take but Pataki is NOT the professor you want. He means well, but he talks to you like you're Neil Degrasse Tyson and already know everything. Then when you ask questions he makes you feel stupid. Easy A though
One of worst professors I have had at NYU. His lectures are completely disorganized and mostly comprised of personal anecdotes rather than information from the text that will be on the exam. He is extremely unclear with his directions during labs. You won't learn anything of significance in class, so be prepared to read the textbook.
I had Professor Pataki for History of the Universe over J-Term so yes my experience with him probably isn't as difficult as it would have been over the semester; but even so, Professor Pataki is amazing. He is so passionate about the topic &amp; gives great lectures. He really cares about his students so he's very approachable &amp; VERY helpful. Take him!
Professor Pataki is a great guy and he has some really amazing stories. His lectures are really long though and don't fall asleep or miss class or you'll miss a bunch of important material. He gives you sample test questions before exams and if you know the answers those and pay attention to what he emphasizes in class, you're pass. Good professor
Completely non-sequential and sometimes irrelevant way of teaching course material. Spits out an abundance of information unrelated to the course, and personal anecdotes that leave the class utterly confused after every lecture. Expects each student to have an amount of background knowledge that is simply not there. AVOID
He's a sweet guy, and obviously knows what he's talking about, but doesn't seem to realize that his students (especially freshmen) aren't professional astronomers. One big group project consisting of 3 essays, one individual essay, and midterm and final. Pretty lenient grader and tests are easy if you study. Each class feels like its a year long.
The class really isn't very hard. I didn't read the textbook at all. If you do the practice exams and understand how you got the answers and the concepts around it, you will do fine. He's VERY lenient with lab grades and if you need help, you can ask him. However, he's a bit unclear sometimes so you might need to do outside research. Very nice man.
He is awesome. He's not the easiest professor so you have to put in the work. I struggled in the beginning but going to his office hours and studying his practice tests really helped and I got an A on the final. I recommended going to his office hours. Show interest and participate even if the answer isn't right!

Teacher comments: 
His lectures are extremely interesting but get ready to study for his exams which are really really hard. There is one paper to write, which he is extremely critical while grading. Get ready to work but you learn A LOT in his class.
my retention of material from first semester cf1 is amazing- still thinking and applying what i learned in his class now
You pay your tuition for people like him. I took him two years in a row initially almost receiving a D, wanted to prove myself and ended up getting an A the second time. He challenges you, forces you to develop your thoughts, knows how to get you to do that based on how you learn. Participating in class discussion helps more than reading everything
reynolds approaches cultural foundations unlike most profs. he is politically woke, witty, and knows how to pull information out of his students versus just lecturing at them. still thinking about the things i learned in his class today! one of the most intelligent people you will meet ever
is he a super easy grader? no. but when you get an A, youll know you really deserved and earned it. encourages group collaboration and participation. i loved his class so much that i plan to take him again for cf3! organized, passionate, hilarious, brilliant. nothing but good things to say about him!
just wow. full of passion about what he is teaching, very dynamic and engaging, and makes his grading process very clear. he can seem a little intimidating at first but is honestly funny, eloquent, and helpful. really knows how to take command of a classroom but can also be a wonderful listener and encourages discussion.
just amazing. learned more in his class than all my other classes combined, honestly. am still thinking about the things i learned- would highly recommend
If you do not understand something from the class, the guy will get mad at you. Definitely makes people feel bad for giving wrong answers. Very difficult class and assigns lots of homework with hard readings. If he just doesn't like you, expect a bad grade regardless of how hard you work for it. Learning material that no other class is learning.
this semester i didn't miss a single one of reynold's- absolutely amazing professor
probably one of the best professors I've ever had! energetic, engaging, brilliant. definitely take his class if you have the chance.
TAKE REYNOLDS. I am blown away after every single class- he is one the most intelligent people you will ever meet and my favorite professor this semester. He is able to articulately synthesize huge, earth shattering concepts with respect to both detail and overarching aesthetic themes. Funny, energetic, engaging. Am definitely taking him again!
Definitely not an "easy" class, but so worth it; he is one of the most intelligent people I've ever met and his personality and lectures are fantastic.  The material is very interesting, and he makes it even more so.  If you listen while he's talking, do the reading/semi-thoroughly skim, and talk at least once per class, you're golden.
Absolutely amazing.
This guy is super smart and a great lecturer. He demands active participation and unless you connect personally with him, like his love of Massive Attack, prepare to work VERY hard because he is a downright brutal grader.    If you want a challenge, take his class. If you want an easy grade, run for the exit.
Best teacher I ever had. Learn from him if you have the chance.
This class changed my life and that's not an exaggeration. Yes, it's difficult. Yes, it's a lot of work. But I've found myself continuing to think about what I learned in this course and using the knowledge I gained in other courses and aspects of my life. It will challenge you and change your entire worldview, for the better. Incredible professor.
Though many LSP classes are a joke, this class is one of the most intellectually demanding I've ever taken. Some of the texts are extremely challenging, but very interesting. I don't think he expects anyone to fully understand all the material, but as someone else said, this was the first class I took that felt college level rather than high school
The most amazing class I have ever taken, at NYU or otherwise. Professor Reynolds forced me to make connections and push myself intellectually in a way that I never have before. The class is very difficult, but if you put adequate effort in, you will go places academically that you never though you could. Improved me as a writer, reader &amp; student.
Had him a couple years ago as a sophomore &amp; I wish I could retake his class. Recently found my notes from this class &amp; I remember not understanding anything but now it all makes so much more sense. Def has high expectations for his students. But one of the best classes I've ever taken. So wish I could take him again.
The dude is well structured and dedicated to teaching his student. Would recommend if you want to be challenged intellectually.
Teacher name: Bauer, Elizabeth
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Great instructor, caring, and nice. Goes over content thoroughly, tells us what topics will be on the exam, and even allows a cheat sheet and formula sheet to use during the exam. Could even drop our lowest exam grade. SPSS assignments were annoyingly tedious to complete but helpful in learning and understanding material.
Absolutely awful. She is a kind lady but her lectures are hard and she goes too fast. The only ones who do not struggle in her class are the ones who already took statistics in high school.
For someone who really hates math, Bauer was a great prof. Daily attendance through an app, but u don't have to be there. double sided handwritten cheat cheat allowed. 4 exams, lowest is dropped, 1 cumulative final. recitation was pretty annoying. if u find urself falling behind, make sure to get a tutor asap.
Attendence is taken through app, so you don't really have to be there. She allows a "cheat sheet" for tests. Strongly recommended
Shes a great teacher. Took the same class in high school and did terribly. Took her class and got a high A. She is insanely intelligent and sweet. Very helpful outside of class. Lets you review your tests and lets you bring in some notes for test days.
Great professor. Makes Stats easy, and I've never taken it before. Cheat sheets on all exams and final. Lowest exam is dropped. Fun and interesting lectures. Make the cheat sheet thoroughly and it's an easy A (it also forces you to study. Would 100% take again! Also, lectures on youtube if you miss.
Prof. Bauer is an excellent professor, and makes Statistics manageable and sometimes even enjoyable. You will learn the material and be thankful that you did.
Easily the best professor I've had at NYU thus far. Even if you're afraid of statistics, Beth makes it easy to understand and pushes you to do your best. Go to lectures and put the work in and you'll be golden.
I absolutely loved this class and this professor. She teaches the material extremely clearly. Lowest exam gets dropped and each exam (including the final) allows for a cheat sheet. Also, if you ever miss class, her lectures are on Youtube! Highly recommend
Organized, amazing lectures, applies stats to real life, really knows her craft. Honestly speaking, she is one of the best professors I've had at NYU (saying alot, because I've had many of the "hyped" professors at nyu). The material gets hard toward the end, but thats not her fault. With consistent studying, an A is achievable.
SHE'S AMAZING. TAKE HER. I hate Stats w/ passion, but loved this class and went to every single lecture because she's perfection. Her lectures are so helpful- clear, funny, and always gives clear/ interesting examples. Always open for questions and available outside of class. Drops one exam and gives you many other opportunities to redeem yourself
One favorite teachers at NYU thus far. As a student who enjoys math but has never been excellent at it, I found her class quite manageable and rewarding. One tool I found quite helpful was in actually reading the text before exams. Sometimes I could not follow her lecture at such an early hour, but I found the text beyond adequate. Not hard.
a lot of people saying it's critical to go to lecture, but i disagree - you'll make an easy a if you go to recitation and pay attention to what you're writing down on the cheat sheet she lets you bring into exams. it's all about practicing the material, and between recitation worksheets and homework assignments there's plenty opportunity
Very responsible, organized, helpful professor. Effectively reduces math phobia. Incredible that she has 3 office hours each week - not that you can go for all three every week - try to find your TA instead - but that shows her commitment to teaching. Exams are fair. Grasp the basic concepts and you should be able to do well with some practices.
Good professor
Bauer is a great professor and wants students to do well. Her lectures are clear and exams are fair. Like any math, the end builds on the beginning so keep up
A lot of people seem to think she can be a bit intimidating/sassy but that's really just her sarcastic personality. Her lectures are packed with a lot of good information (which can sometimes be overwhelming) but she is good at explaining when needed. She can be slightly impatient, but only because she holds everyone to such a high standard.
Very difficult, comparable to Calc 2 in teaching and difficulty. Heavy workload like Calc 2. The only people who are able to do well have taken AP Stats in high school. Don't take it with Bauer unless its a requirement.
I took MA stats during my first semester of grad school and planned my whole schedule around Dr. Bauer's class because of the reviews I read here. She's amazing - I've been afraid of math my whole life and now I can't wait to take more stats classes! Entire grade is basically based on 4 exams - remember concepts are as important as computations!
You must pay attention to the lectures, you will not pass otherwise. The tests, especially towards the end of the semester are extremely difficult. You MUST study for these test. There is not a lot of leniency in her grading. She also was not very  patient or helpful when I attended her office hours and she seemed annoyed by students coming to her.
Teacher name: Sohan, Shivam
School name: New York University

Teacher comments: 
Sohan is a great guy, lectures are very interesting and relatable to real issues for the real world. I cant wait for capstone!
It was a great class to take. Interesting topics, so make sure and pay attention in class, most of his stuff shows up on the exams.
Contradicting with certain current events buts sets the expectation very high post graduation of the 'real world'. I would take him again.
Prof Sohan is brilliant, intelligent, hard working, insightful and extremely helpful. He is the man! Take his class, you won't regret it.
He is great, very clear in conveying information and very fair in his grading.
Professor Sohan is the best professor ever., pretty funny guy. He makes healthcare finance interesting and he is available whenever you need help.
Sohan teaches complex material in a very clear cut way and takes difficult material and makes it somewhat simple. He goes over every quiz and homework the day it is graded. You must study or the quizzes will kill you. No curve
He is an excellent prof! Lectures were always interesting and he has great study tips. Do the readings and go to the lectures and you will do well in this course.
Take note of actually going to class, recording every lecture, and doing the online practice quizzes are the keys to getting an A in this class. Professor Sohan is a great lecturer and will keep you engaged in this class.
Quite honestly he is the most helpful professor in the department. Without a doubt would not have gotten an A in the class without him!
Professor Sohan is a really good teacher. He is very funny and interesting and make all the lectures fun to attend. The test however were very difficult and I could not get a good grade.
Great course, well taught, excellent lectures, precise and accurate testing... Go Sohan!
Awesome Professor!! He makes this class so interesting. He relates everything with a story which is really helpful and makes you remember the material. Really great Professor!
Sohan is a great lecturer, if Healthcare Finance is your field or of interest, I would recommend. He cares about the field and is well educated but still very approachable. Quizzes and tests were hard, takes serious studying to get a good grade, but it is possible.
Super consistent professor, dedicated to your success. 10/10 -would learn from again.
Prof Sohan is a great teacher and person in general. Always available to help in any way he can. Teaches the material in the simplest way possible so everyone can understand. Tests aren't easy but he prepares you well.
Make sure you work and understand the material. If you do the work you will do well. He never hesitates to offer help on a concept and will make sure you understand it. His lectures can be long but they're generally entertaining. I really enjoyed taking his class.
Professor Sohan knows his stuff!!
What a professor. He is the real quality professor every student hopes to have. Polite and generous and he truly knows how to teach. Educated and that's why he knows how to pass it on. A true value..
Sohan is Super helpful. You definitely get a good background. The class is hands on. He will answer any questions you have and will help you outside of class. He's  all about making yourself marketable.
Teacher name: Goldberg, Burt
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is an ok professor. He is very hard to talk to. Lectures aren't helpful so I just learned on my own. LG Sheets and HW's are fair questions to be on the exam. Thats how you prepare for his exams.
The class boils down to you doing the LG review sheets. If you did the homework and the review you are guaranteed at least a B on the exams. He does take attendance in lecture, and recitation quizzes matter. He likes to lecture on things other than the material but he's a really nice person. Its chemistry so still hard but he makes it easier.
burt himself is a very smart man, he has so much knowledge stored in his head and he teaches fairly well. the course itself is pretty easy as well, he gives textbook questions that are the "study guides" and a lot of the test questions are directly from these questions. lecture quizzes don't count at all still got an a and never went to class.
he is brilliant and updates his study guides often. helped me through mcat studying. Updating the study guides helped me with self-discipline and studying more efficiently. def recommend!
Lectures hard to follow, pretty rude in office hours. You understand the material with his study guides, which are nearly identical to the exam he gives you, but he doesn't give you the answers, and you have to look for them in his disorganized lectures/google. 95-100 is an A which is pretty ass, no drops, no curve. But Rohini Qamra was lit.
One of the most brilliant (although slightly condescending) professors in the Chem department.  His exams are easy as long as you study the way he tells you to and drill yourself with the study guides.  Overall a great class from someone who has a passion for the subject material.  If you took MCB (BIOLUA 21/22), this class is essentially a repeat
Extremely arrogant, rude, and mean. He knows nothing about mutual respect, but his class is easy. Do his study guides and you will get an A.
Dr. Goldberg definitely has favorites, but if you ask good questions and pay attention to him during class, the class will be well worth it. Doing the Study Guides makes the difference of whether you get an A or D in the course. Try to do these in a good time span since he tends to put a lot of questions on them. Highly recommend taking it.
Burt has a "very bright" personality which is not understood by some, but he is The Best in his specialty. Make sure to absorb all the knowledge he has to offer! The subject is difficult with a lot to memorize/learn, yet he teaches only what you need to be successful in med school! Very fair grader, honest and charming. Take him at all costs!!!
He is the best. He's rude but only to students he knows and he's always joking! It doesn't matter if you listen in lecture because if you complete the study guide that he sends you, you will 100% get an A.
It hurts me when people say bad things about BG because he genuinely is the kindest professor i've had at NYU. He cares about all of his students, he just has a funny way of showing it. Lecture is worth going to not even for the material but purely for his stories which are extremely entertaining. Love him!
Dr. Goldberg is definitely not one to mess with, but with that in mind as long as you pay attention in lectures and DO THE STUDY GUIDES then there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A. Make sure to ask more questions during office hours rather than in lectures themselves. Forming study groups is really helpful in the class as well.
He's one of my favorite professors. He comes off a little intimidating at first, but a week or two into the semester you'll figure out he just cares a lot. The lectures aren't overly helpful, but worth showing up to if you have the time. Find a couple of friends to study with. DO THE STUDY GUIDE - IT IS THE EXAM. Put in the work, it'll pay off.
This dude is great. Gen Chem 2 was a class I feared, but I loved it a lot. The class is designed in a way that allows for everyone to get as much as they can out of it, and I really appreciated that. Goldberg does get tied up in his own interests during lecture from time to time, and office hours might be daunting, but the product is really great.
He renewed my interest in chemistry after Mandziuk had destroyed it. He's by far the best science teacher I've had at NYU. He even made me want to switch my major from Biology to Biochemistry (Still debating that). Hopefully I'll have him for Biochem!!
Best Chem professor I have ever had! Aside from having interesting lectures, he is also very inspirational and wants to motivate us all to continue strong in our desired career paths. He really did save my semester and thoughts about continuing with pre-med! I owe it all to this man
Burt Goldberg is the best professor I've ever had at NYU. Do not believe any negative thing you hear about him. This man will change your life. I love him.
Was continually disappointed by his lectures. He does yell a lot and insults people, but as someone mentioned he's a softie, you can see that he means well. At first I liked him, but I learned almost nothing from lecture cause of his rambling; he goes off on a tangent with stories from his youthetc. Which is sad because he's obviously intelligent.
Best prof. I have ever had.
One of the best professors I have taken! He may seem intimidating in the beginning, but he is a softy at heart. He appreciates people that do the study guides on time, show up to lecture and make an effort in class. Answer the study guides and you will do fine on the exams.
Teacher name: Bari, Anasse
School name: New York University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great class! His exams are not that easy but if you study hard you will do well. A lot of work in this class and you will learn a lot. He is very smart and it seems like he is very strategic about everything he does in this class. It was good overall.
The first mid-term had questions that we had hardly covered and he is incredibly vague with quiz dates, which were basically pop-quizzes. Arguably one of the most disorganized classes I've taken. Often went over the class time. Participation was based on if you answered the question right when he called on you, which has a huge impact on grading.
This is for Bari's PA class. Workload is high for a noncaptone class. But he will also help you a lot if you approach him. If you need help outside of class, he is approachable. He rather you learn something valuable than just grade your half ass work. At the end of the day, I've learned more about ML and DS than from my ML class.
If you want to learn without the fear of making mistakes, he is the best professor and mentor and awesome guide. He only wants to see a lot of hard work and innovation.
Best Professor I've had at NYU, his class makes you work very hard but it really turns you into a programmer in the end! Very genuine and inspirational as well!
He made me want to major in CS and enjoy coding! Best professor I've ever had!
Best professor I have had in all of college. He's reasonably challenging, but I guarantee you'll learn the material. Exams are very fair (basically gives you what will be on the exam) and he's exceedingly understanding when it comes to extensions. While attendance isn't mandatory, he knows if you are there or not and it will affect your grade.
Bari is a super thorough professor. Data Structures is a huge jump from 101 but he explains the concepts in great detail, and recognizes when students work hard and rewards them accordingly. His tests are difficult, but the other profs don't do it as well as he does. Bari is awesome!!!
Great class. Fostered on love &amp; appreciation of CS. Would recommend class &amp; Professor
good but way too hard
Bari has an incredible ability to remember students by name. He will remember you and will notice your participation. I struggled in his class but he did his best to make it as easy as possible. Great class and very fair.
He is the best. I love Bari!!!!
Professor Bari is very enthusiastic about data structures. It was a demanding class but overall it was good.
I learned so much from Bari. Take his class and you will learn so much.
Good class. It is too hard for those who are not fit to do computer science. I worked hard and attended the class got an A
Knows a lot about the material, but gives very difficult exams and can be quite harsh and unfriendly. Often highlights what specific things will be on exams during lectures, so attendance is super important.
I personally had an extremely difficult time in Bari's class. The way he taught was not for me, but other people seemed to like him. I think that taking a different professor would be a better choice. Hard course.
you learn a lot if you work hard. personally, i still found it extremely difficult and had to use the book a lot in my own time even after lectures. would recommend to take a different professor.
Most of the people who give him bad reviews don't show up to class then complains when they get a bad score. Data structures is a hard class and if you put in the effort, Bari teaches the material better than any other professors.
Best computer science professor at NYU. He is hard but if you take his class you are sure to learn.
Teacher name: Berta, Joe
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
2 exams, one paper and the final plus attendance. Berta is so funny, he always has a good story. He lets his students know how to succeed in his class. Go to the class before an exam!!!!!
Berta is a really awesome guy. Attendance isn't mandatory but he is very funny and always has really interesting stories, so I enjoyed his lectures. However, your grade is based off of solely three exams, so if you don't do well on one it's hard to get an A. He does give very good study guides though and extra credit opportunities.
Joe Berta is the funniest person alive. I'm going to take any class he teaches.
No attendance pts., the final grade in the course is determined by two midterms and the final exam. I usually attended the lecture, but you do not have to. Pros of showing up - He typically gives out questions that will be on the exams (w/ answers). All the material on the test is given in the study guide and he goes over every question. Easy A.
Berta is the reason I'm a psych major. Although his classes are sometimes considered a joke considering he makes study guides with what's on the test word for word, you still have to work for your grade. He's funny and engaging and really has his student's best interest at heart. I'll be sad the day he retires.
Really funny guy, cares about his students and gave us a free online code for the textbook (though we barely used it). Grades by two tests and a cumulative final, and makes a complete study guide for each. You don't have to show up, but it's a whole experience listening to his life stories. Will miss him next semester!
He is the most amazing professor. In a heavy science based major, his lectures were almost my downtime of comedy and laughter. TAKE COURSES WITH HIM! Even if your're not in the class, just sit in one of the lectures and be prepared to learn in ways you will always remember. Such a good guy. Quite the character.
Berta is absolutely hilarious and I am already signed up for Bio Psych for next semester because of how much .I enjoyed him! Your grade is only tests and there is never any attendance. The slides are posted online and a study guide is given! Highly recommend Berta!
Professor Berta is the BEST professor I have had at CU. I wish he taught all my classes. He is respectful, kind and really helps if you need it. He cares about students and his lectures are awesome. You will love his classes.
Berta is the best! He's my favorite teacher in the psychology department. I took him for General Psychology, Biological psychology, and cognitive psychology. Got all A's. He's funny. Most classes were 3 tests, each worth 33%. He tests you on his study guide and tells you to read a few pages here and there for the study guide. Do it &amp;you'll get an A
Really nice guy!!!
Berta is a great guy who genuinely cares about his students. He makes lectures very entertaining and gets somewhat off topic but always ties it back to psych. Attendance is not mandatory but I still went just because he'd tell some great stories. Easy A, he rounds grades up. Would definitely recommend.
Pretty funny guy, I actually enjoyed coming to class, he even allowed me to make up a midterm that I accidentally missed and hadn't noticed over a month past the initial test date.
He is a nice guy but he does not teach, he only talks about irrelevant stuff, only 3 tests per semester.
Berta is the nicest professor I have ever had. He truly cares about his students. He makes the material easy and interested. Guaranteed A. Great professor.
I took General Psychology with Dr. Berta summer '17, and it was an awesome decision. Professor really knows his stuff and makes class interesting. He always relates psychology topics with amusing real life stories. If you don't feel like a listener you don't need to show up to class (Although it does make understanding material easier).
I love love love Berta. He makes going to class super enjoyable and his tests are completely fair. He gives a study guide that will be very similar to the test. He does rant about his cat and ex gf quite a bit but the man really does know the material he is teaching you. He is always incredibly caring of his students Go to office hours if need help
i love Berta. I have had him for Bio and cog psych and think he is an awesome lecturer. He can get off topic about his cat or ex gf but he keeps the lecture going and is easy to understand. His tests are extremely fair and the book is really not needed. He really does care about his students and if there is a problem he will help out. Easy A.
Lectures can be dry but it's best to show up for them. He can get off topic with funny stories and comments. There are few tests so it pays to keep up with the book and do well on them. It's also good to talk with him after class.
This class was awesome. No homework. Just study the study guides and really understand everything on them and you're good to go. Also, if you ever are worried about your grade and you go in to talk to Berta he will help you out. He's a great guy and really cares about students and wants you to succeed.

Teacher comments: 
BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD!!
It's true, King is hilarious. You'll most likely leave every class having laughed at least once. While sometimes he gets off topic, he usually finds a way to connect it back to lecture which actually helps you remember the concepts in the long run. GO TO CLASS, he gives you a ton of hints about what will be on the exam and doesn't post notes online
Lemme tell yall about this man right here. First of all, dudes hilarious. Ive never actually enjoyed a lecture until this class. He makes the topic interesting and entertaining. The powerpoint slides werent lengthy and taking notes was easy. The tests were also a cake walk if you went to class and read: minimal studying. I highly recommend
Dr. King was one of my favorite professors. He is hilarious and makes the lectures feel like a stand-up show (really). Participation matters. King will cut you slack if he knows you are engaged and show up to class! He is a great guy and professor all around.
This class was really easy and entertaining. All of the tests are based on the reading, and most require examples which can be taken straight from the textbook. This class does involve a lot of reading, but if you do it then it is an easy A.
This class is boring. King does not stop talking the entire class and we only get through about 2 slides per class because he for some reason thinks he is wildly entertaining when he's not(also seems like half his stories are made up). Also he doesn't put his slides online so when we don't get through lecture we have to teach ourselves the material
His lectures and the material are both super interesting and engaging. He is so funny and like others have said, very passionate about the subject, which makes it even better. Tests are pretty easy but you do have to read the textbook.
Hes awesome
Awesome teacher, very approachable, very inthusiastic about his work. Overall a great teacher
Dr. King is the best professor I have ever had at CU. Other reviews are saying you don't learn anything from his lectures.... I took a summer course with him and I have never learned so much in one class. His lectures are interesting and information rich. He makes the material relatable and easy to understand and he is absolutely hilarious!
King is one of my favorite teachers I have had, he is an amazing prof and wants students to succeed. He had a lot of family emergencies in the semester I had him but still showed up positive and ready to teach and hated missing class for any reason. Very funny guy with really entertaining lectures. Made me interested in learning content.
He is easily one of the funniest teachers I have ever had! A really great guy who has many years of experience in his field. I wish he could teach every psych class at CU.
If you have the opportunity to take a course with professor King, I highly recommend it! He genuinely wants his students to succeed and makes learning psychology fun. He provides clear and helpful feedback and his exams aren't difficult if you study.
Dr. King's class has been my favorite so far!!! Even days when I was feeling sick or didn't plan on going to class, I went to his because I always left feeling better. I guarantee you will laugh EVERY lecture and the hour will seem like a solid 15 minutes. He loves what he does and comes to class every day with a smile on his face. Great guy!
He doesn't post the lectures online so you have to go to class, but he makes the lectures super fun because he's hilarious. He also doesn't make study guides but the tests are pretty straight forward if you go to class and pay attention. Brett is super understanding and respectful so if you ever have a problem go talk to him!!
Very nice guy but not a very effective teacher. He treats lectures like a stand up routine which can be funny sometimes but other times it is just frustrating when you want him to move on and explain the material. The book is incredibly boring but 100% mandatory. If you don't read the book you will not do well. Also never responds to email.
Dr. King is a very nice person, and makes lectures interesting, however he does not post lectures online, so attendance is mandatory. The book is heavily used on the tests, so make sure to get it. Tests are really easy as long as you prepare, however they were worth 100% of your grade, so make sure you study!
I like him as a person, but as a professor, he was awful. The lectures can be entertaining but he gets off topic and misses important stuff that is needed on the test. You must read the textbook or you will fail. Doesn't post his notes online so you have to attend class and never replies to emails. I attended most classes and still had a tough time
Hilarious and puts on a show every lecture. He's very welcoming and friendly, and I was never shy to go talk to him.
His lectures are really funny and he's a good storyteller but he gets so side tracked that he doesn't ever cover half of the material on the test in class. He's a better comedian than he is a professor. The tests were then super specific on things from the reading while glossing over a lot of the material we did go over in class.
Teacher name: Martichuski, Diane
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I also took her for PSYC2111 and she was amazing in both classes. For PSYC1001 attendance is not mandatory and as long as you complete the weekly quizzes and keep up with reading, you'll get an easy A.
Can seem kinda tough at first but is great with extenuating circumstances if you give her advance notice. Computational problems are easy; concepts are easily understood if you go to lecture and talk yourself through what you're doing (textbook is useless but you need it for online quizzes). Use a graphing calculator on exams if you have one!
Diane is super funny, chill and a great teacher! She gives so many opporunities to learn and to get a good grade in her class and her lectures teach you everything you need to know! The tests aren't super hard and she gives you cheat sheets on the third test. The final is open book open note and if you get an A you get an A in the class!
DO NOT take her. She is extremely insensitive. I took AP stats in high school and my high school teacher was better. Got a B in the class, and worked my ass off. With little help from her.
She's a real sarcastic and quirky lady. Which was fine for me but if you're easily offended or upset then Dr. Martichuski might not be the best choice for you. Her sense of humor really lightens the mood. Sometime she says some odd things when she goes off on tangents which is quite often. Class is not mandatory.
If you took psych in high school I definitely recommend not taking this class. All of professor Martichuski's lectures are exactly what are on the outline she gives you, therefore you end up not going to class or not paying attention during class. Mostly only talks abut weed and sex and tests and quizzes are on content we have not learned yet.
Prof Martichuski always made jokes in class and connected the class content to current events of the real world. The midterms were super easy and we barely had any papers assigned. If you came to class and studied at least a little bit, it's an easily passable class.
Dr. Martichuski is extremely insensitive. She treats you like you are an idiot if you don't understand something. She also only has office hours for 40 minutes a week, super rude in email, and made a girl cry in class. The two girls I have class with have failed her class once, and I am fighting to get by so I never have to take her again.
I took gen psych in hs and received an A and then came to college and took it again and barely got a C. She goes off topic all the time and talks about weed all the time or religion. Her test do not reflect anything that we were taught in class or given for practice. Her clicker questions are pretty fair, but not on the test. DO NOT TAKE HER.
For this psych stats class, ATTENDANCE IS A MUST! Professor Martichuski's LA's disagreed with her teaching method and exams so going to help for them this semester was extremely difficult. Get ready to teach yourself.
It seems like she wants you to fail, she's always saying if you didn't do well on so and so you should just drop the class. Not encouraging in the slightest and while she can be funny, she comes off as mean more than anything.
I thought her class was difficult, but overall I understood everything and did just fine.
I loved taking Psych 1000 with Dr. Martichuski. She is so funny and gives really great examples in class. Her tests and quizzes are all online which rocks and if you do the assigned work and come to class, her classes aren't difficult at all. I miss having her as a prof, and would definitely take another class she teaches. Highly recommend.
She sucks get ready to fail if you're bad at math
Diane is awesome! She makes her lectures fun and interesting and even creates note outlines that you can print and take with you to class. But, going to class definitely helps because some of her test questions are on things she said in class that aren't necessarily in the notes. Overall, I loved the class.
20% quizzes, 20% each on 3 exams, 20% final. Offers 10 points of extra credit out of 500 for the class. Doesn't specify what will be on the exam, but you can go to her to defend your answers on exams and SHE WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT BACK.
Loved loved loved her class! Would take again and recommend to anyone
Really good solid professor. Usually reachable via email and if not her TA is quick to respond then she will follow up. I took her online class which was really clearly explained through her lecture slides.  The online textbook was helpful supplemental material. She has tests that make you think, but she prepares you with good study guides &amp; practi
I don't understand why everyone is giving her such negative reviews. Yes you have to read a little (the text book is online and you have the choice to listen) and go to the lectures her amazing humor makes class extremely interesting and it's not hard to pay attention. The tests are also online and open note making her class not very hard.
Class is based on 500 points, if you do bad on one thing you're screwed her lectures don't help if you want to do well you have to spend time on reading the textbook over and over.
Teacher name: Adler, Patti
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Patti is a phenomenal sociologist, but her classes aren't for the lazy. Deviancy in US Society was a hard class, especially exams, but if you read the book and take notes in lecture, it's passable. The TA's and ATA's are a valuable resource. Patti isn't that helpful, but that's what the TA's are for. Doing well in recitation helps a lot on exams.
Rude and stupid hard tests. Not a nice person.
Definitely not an easy class, but you get a giant note card for very test to reference. Go to class, take notes, and put all your notes on the note card. I never actually studied, but i always made the notecard, and always did fine on the test. Also always do the homework. It comes in handy later.
terrible teacher
Avoid Adler at all costs. Her class is incredibly hard to follow, her power points provide no info, and the book is very hard to understand and read. Her exams and grading are also in some weird format that has to be perfect or you lose points on the test.
If you are dedicated to working hard in this class, you will do well.  Not for lazy people looking for an easy A.
Patti is an incredibly intelligent and outgoing person, and an amazing professor. Her stories are entertaining and this was one class I actually looked forward to going to!
I had the honor of taking Deviance in US Society. Using her real world research studies brings to life real &amp; honest issues. Some of the subject topics may be non-standard. That which makes us uncomfortable isn't something to be afraid of or to be shunned from the classroom. These types of discussions allow people &amp; societies to grow &amp; progress.
Easily the realest, most interesting class I've ever taken. Patti is a fantastic professor and is very engaging. Lecture was always very funny and it was not a chore to attend like some are.
This was one of my favorite classes its sad how the university no longer values academic freedom among their staff and forced her into retirement.
Patti was one of the best teachers I've ever had! Her classes are captivating and interesting to listen to! It's unfortunate that the university has decided to part ways with her though. She was a really great teacher who knew her stuff!
This is Patti's favorite class and is extremely passionate about it. I never got bored in lecture, but it easy to get distracted in a 500 student lecture. Lecture slides consist of 50% of tests, textbook lists make up the other 50%. Read the textbook, make an organized test note card, and go to recitation to do well!
SUCH an interesting class! All we talk about is prostitutes and drugs. Patti is a great teacher- she's very funny and relatable. As long as you read and go to lecture, you will pass. Take Kathryn as your TA- she is so passionate and informative.
If you go to class, make a good notecard for the tests, and do all of the reading lists from the textbook there is no way you won't do well in this class, you just have to try and pay attention and be good at applying knowledge because the tests aren't multiple choice.
Very interesting class. However, you need to understand the test format and what they are asking to do well.  Your notecard is your life saver.  Patti is a wonderful professor, but don't skip this class.  It is not that hard to get an A in the class, just make sure your notecard is thorough and write super small.
Patti is so awesome! Her class is truly interesting and she is quite a character herself. This is a tough course especially for students used to being tested by multiple choice exams.  She uses a short response and essay format for her exams which requires students to truly understand the material in order to succeed. An A is totally possible!
Patti has been my favorite professor at the University of Colorado. She has a great way of making the class very interesting. I found the class fairly easy because of how interesting it was.
Before taking this class I was mostly uninterested in studying Sociology. This class was a game-changer for me. I absolutely loved this class and found everything discussed interesting and applicable to the real world. Every student at CU should take this class!
I had Patti for Deviance which is an amazing class! I thought it would just be another boring core class but i loved it! Patti is hilarious and you learn a lot of really cool information. Take this class if you can! You wont regret it and you'll have an awesome time laughing every time you're in her lecture! I loved Patti's class!
Professor Adler is great! She is very knowledgeable and always keeps lecture interesting (you will NOT be bored.) She is really understanding and helpful. This class is a must take!!
Teacher name: Graves, Phil
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Graves was the boy. If you got above a 95 (WITH THE CURVE) on both midterms you didn't have to take the final. Curves on each midterm were heavy (10-12%). If you go to class and do the online homework this class is a breeze. Only graded items in the class were the midterms and the final.
His hour and a half long lectures are about how he would run the world and only teaches you to learn about graphs. He doesn't slow down to explain simple concepts and expects you to know everything. If you have a bad T.A expect to do poorly unless you get outside help. The homework has nothing to do with lectures or recitation. Pass this Professor.
His lectures are long and he makes simple concepts confusing through bad examples. The online portion is messed up, I did practice questions and ones I left blank ended up going against my grade. His grading is ridiculous, I was .2 away from an A, and the online factors I didn't know about and wasn't on the syllabus made me get a B. DO NOT TAKE HIM
Lectures and are really long and boring. Test are hard.
I'm about to finish up microecon with Graves and so far it's been fairly easy. I went to a total of four lectures (2 of which were the midterms) and I have an A in the course. As long as you read the book and go to recitation, you will be fine. Tests can be tricky for a lot of people but he curves the hell out of them.
I may be biased because this material comes to me fairly easy but I thought he did a great job teaching the course. My advice would be to not miss class. Lots of anecdotes that I thought kept the class from becoming monotonous. Think I'll try and minor in Econ because of the course.
Most people are probably gonna rate him poorly but I think his class was great. At the very least he is entertaining. His lectures weren't great but you will learn if you can pay attention unlike 95% of the class.
NOT a good professor, super boring not my best choice at all. Tests are super tough so read your little heart out.
Fantastic teacher. Logical as hell. Great grading system. Rambles in class about sometimes off topic material, but very interesting guy without a doubt. Highly recommend this teacher to anyone wanting to pass Microeconomics. You do not have to attend, DON'T so everyone who does gets better grades. Very competitive curve, 75 avg.
Professor Graves tests are quite difficult as they are littered with trick questions. He does curve it based on the overall class average, but you will find it hard to pass if you blow off his class. READ THE BOOK it will save your grade.
Grave's lectures are incredibly long and make you want to fall asleep. He over complicates simple concepts with a ton of useless, drawn out examples. His tests are very tricky too; The second midterm has a class average of a 53 but he curves like a madman. Reading your textbook will save your semester, STAY CLEAR OF THIS PROF.
Horrible lectures including topics completely non-related. Tests are ridiculous. None of the homework correlates with the midterms. Terrible teaching.   Midterms are multiple choice meaning that if you miss five you get an 80, and lets face it no one can miss just five. Every average ends up a failed grade so why does Graves continue with this???
Good teachers. Tests just like the practice ones;
First off, I would definitely not recommend taking any course with Graves. Online homework has no correlation to tests so studying is very tough. He makes his own presentations which are not related to the homework, textbook or tests so good luck doing even "decent" with this confusing teacher.
The textbook he uses is very difficult to follow and is completely different than the Aplia homework but it is easier to follow than his lectures. Graves loves economics and knows it very well that he assumes that an intro class should be easy. Midterms are ridiculously hard, probably 10x the hw. Average midterm grade was a 53%, take a diff prof
Phil is a legend. His lectures are all on point and he keeps you engaged the whole class. He is often behind and gets distracted easily, but he is hilarious. Also its an entry level econ class, you could have a monkey teach it and learn the same thing from a professor that has been teaching their entire career. Phil Graves is a definite must take.
Gets off track way too easily, in addition to having very long winded and monotonous presentation of topics
Graves loves what he does and you can tell, but it was hard for him to explain something simple, he tends to get very off track to the point you don't want to go to lecture and think you can teach yourself (you can't). His tests are difficult because they have nothing to do with the homework. Be careful of TAs, hit or miss.
Graves was behind on his lectures the whole semester. Our TAs would assign online homework each week but the things that the homework covered were not even close to what he was lecturing us on that week. Make sure to read the textbook too because the book won't try to make stupid jokes and actually make you understand the material.
He takes forever to explain something simple. He gets off track sometimes.
Teacher name: Dubson, Mike
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Mike Dubson is very well respected by students in the physics department, he is known for engaging and informative lectures. He seems pretty down-to-earth and a nice guy too. You'll like taking a class with him.
great lectures. as a lecturer, he is one of the best out there. every class is engaging and clear. overall, my issues are with the physics department as a whole. multiple choice exams are a horrible way to access knowledge, especially multiple choice exams filled with trick questions. dubson was awesome, but the class takes a lot of work.
One of the only professors I've had that manages to hold everyone's attention in a 300 person lecture hall. He's pretty funny and he has daily clicker questions which count for a part of your grade. As long as you do and understand the practice tests you'll do fine on the tests.
One of the best physics Professors !
Dubsons an awesome teacher, clearly knows exactly what he's doing, very effective &amp; entertaining lectures. Class is very hard, if youre not sure about physics beware of Calc 1&amp;2 requirement for PHYS 1&amp;2. Mastering physics takes hours and is way more complicated than anything else you'll see. Dubson is hardly available for help, go to help room
Always finds ways to make lectures interesting and fun for students. Great use of demonstrations to help everyone understands the theory taught right before. May be this course in general but quite a bit of homework for lectures and recitations.
Incredible lectures, highly recommend him. When I struggled he was very supportive outside of class too.
Dr. Dubson is one of the best professors ever. His lectures are fun and helpful. Everyone can enjoy his class while learning. (I took his PHYS1110 and PHYS1120.)
Very good at teaching a large lecture.
Dubson excels at making sure you don't just get on your phone and stay there. While I definitely have passed many lectures zoning out due to monotonous professors or a lack of enthusiasm, Dubson keeps you engaged, entertained, and caring. Which, in the long run, means less studying and googling answers since you actually remember the lecture.
Attend Class for Clicker Points which is a part of your grade. Lecture notes are very helpful print them.
This class is scattered. Lectures, homework, and tests all cover different material at different levels. Homework, for example, is WAY harder than lecture (or even the tests) and takes hours. You may feel you understand in lecture and get clicker questions right consistently, but that doesn't mean you'll do well on the tests. All hail the curve.
He's funny, charismatic, no-nonsense and does some brilliant demonstrations in class.
Best professor I have ever had. I went to him after almost every lecture, and he spent ample amount of time with me to ensure I understood everything. He told me he wished more students went to him for help. Very personable, and knows A LOT. I highly recommend him to everyone!
As a biochemistry major, I found this course really challenging. I took honors physics in high school and still struggled. Dubson is good at explaining things, but this is a huge lecture so if you have questions you generally don't go to him specifically for help.
The physics department here is amazing and Dubson is the reason for it. His lectures clearly make you fully understand physics with his unusually perfect chalkboard writing skills. Everything is to the point and you feel much more comfortable with the material after he's done lecturing. Wish I could take Dubson every year.
By far one of the most inspirational teachers I have had, Professor Dubson gives clear, engaging lectures that makes you enjoy the material.
Great instructor. Clear, detailed,and interesting. Funny and lots of amusing anecdotes. Sorry he apparently isn't planning to so any more MOOC's.
I came across professor Michael Dubson's lectures on an online EdX MOOC by MIT and found them profoundly interesting and helpful. He has a very clear way of explaining tough concepts and i specially like his quizzes in between the lectures. An amazing teacher!
He is the one that writes all of the notes that the other physics teachers use. He is not always clear with his lectures, but what's not covered in lecture is covered in his online notes. Not always engaging, but a respectable physics teacher.
Teacher name: Hendrickson, Susan
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
An ideal spokesperson for Chem induction. Has been a consummate professional. Responds to email promptly, flexible with scheduling, comes to recitation to answer questions!! Tests on what she teaches, clear explanation of concepts, illustrative lectures, really a pro at teaching, and dry, sharp humor. Sit up front and ask her questions at lecture!
She is a very nice professor and funny. She is always willing to help you if you are having trouble and replies to emails fast. No tests are dropped and no tests are curved (one of the averages for a midterm was 64%). However, she does curve the class at the end.
She is very nice and makes an 8 AM not horrible. She is very helpful in help room so I often went when she was there. That being said her exams are very tricky. The averages for the exams were two C-'s and one had a D- average. There were times I had the right answer but changed it since the wording threw me off. She favors algebra over concepts.
Dr. H is a great teacher! Chem 1133 is a difficult class so be ready to show up to numerous office hours and do a lot of out of class studying.
Dr. Hendrickson is the reason I felt good about most of the concepts in chemistry. She teaches them in a logical way and takes feedback from students to be able to teach future students more well . Tests are tricky but it you put the effort in and do the practice tests you should be fine.
It's a chemistry course so it's not going to be easy. Wasn't the best professor I've taken but I think it was mainly my lack of interest in the material.
I think Dr. Hendrickson is a great teacher who puts a lot of effort into making her lectures informational and understandable. she is very accommodating. Her tests are tricky so make sure to read carefully. Textbook is not needed to do well in GenChem2, she posts extra practice problems online. Just make sure to study and you will do well in class
She is the best gen chem prof at CU. She is entertaining, easy to understand and has amazing lectures. The class is easy, just go to every lecture as participation counts, do practice exams and HW. The practice exams are past exams so they have similar problems. She is amazing and really cares about her students. If you can, take chem with her.
One of the best professors I've had. She's here to help, she's clear &amp; consice, and makes me laugh almost every day. So thankful I took chemistry from her (gen chem 1 &amp; gen chem 2) she does an amazing job even though the class and is lightly terrible and very difficult... but she makes it better!
Shes great! Interesting lectures and cool material that can be fun. However tests can be hard, I had never gotten under a B in a chemistry exam before and this course changed that. You will need to put some effort but it is ok because you will suffer happly because Hendrickson is hilarious.
She is an amazing professor! Her slides were clear and concise, and she teaches all the material that will show up on the test. She keeps class lively, and provides additional resources on D2L to help you succeed in her class. She's always willing to  help you if you ask, and she is one of the nicest professors I have ever talked too. Take from her
Hands down the best professor I have ever had. She makes learning chemistry understandable and easy to swallow. Very caring and wants all of her students to succeed. Her lectures are clear and concise, and makes sure you have all of the necessary tools to do well in the class! The content is definitely hard, but it's best to learn it from her.
Instructions for lab reports were cryptic and unclear on purpose. Tests were tricky on purpose. The help room is over crowded, different TAs give conflicting information, and the amount of effort put into the class is not earned back in the form of a good grade or in knowledge. Waste of time/$. Most frustrating endeavor in my young life.
Very caring professor. She's a good person but loves to trick you on exams. It's a tough class and the professor being nice doesn't change it. In terms of teaching i thought i learned the most through lecture and i enjoyed her demos. I took 2 semesters with her. Best Gen Chem prof if you need to take it, take it with her.
She will never make you feel like you don't belong in her classes. She makes lecture fun, and she has the best chemistry jokes you'll ever hear.
She is by far the best GenChem teacher here at CU. She is organized, presents the material in understandable terms, and makes sure you get the concepts. She's also super passionate and nerdy, and always brings jokes into the classroom. Highly recommend her.
Dr. Hendrickson is hands down the best professor I have ever had. Being in such a huge lecture hall, she recognizes that hand raises aren't common, and manages to anticipate our questions. Whenever a question on the topic came to my mind, it seemed like she would always answer it moments later. She's a wonderful lecturer!
This is definitely a weed out class. My best advice to you is to get help from a TA WHENEVER you don't understand a homework problem . If you struggle at all on the homework, you're not prepared for the test.
One of the best professors I've ever had! Dr. Hendrickson made lectures easy to attend and material easy to learn. 10/10 would take one of her classes again. Also had pretty cool demos, explained the math part of chem pretty well, and was super helpful at the helproom (which you should definitely take advantage of).
One of the best professors I've ever had! Dr. Hendrickson made lectures easy to attend and material easy to learn. 10/10 would take one of her classes again.
Teacher name: Kaplan, Jules
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Kaplan is a great professor that makes difficult economic concepts very understandable. He doesn't use any sort of powerpoint, so it's crucial you go to every class, but his classes are really enjoyable so it's not too bad! Kaplan's class is fairly easy if you pay attention and put in the effort!
Kaplan is a good lecturer and he knows what he is talking about. Don't even think about skipping class because he writes everything on the board and doesn't post anything on D2L. Exams are kinda hard, but if you pay attention in class and really review your notes, its doable.
He is the worst teacher I have taken at CU. We are in the 21st century and he is not that old he should know how to make a basic powerpoint but he just puts no effort in his class. He doesn't present material well and his homework questions and test questions are very ambiguous and poorly written. He also puts nothing on D2L.
I would say Kaplan is an okay teacher. He knows what he is talking about but that doesn't mean he knows how to explain it well. Test material is tricky and you need to take notes on exactly what he says if not then good luck doing well on exams. Some material on tests weren't covered at all in class.
Kaplan is a really good lecturer and does a phenomenal job of relating course materials to the real world. He makes our learning seem applicable and valuable. He does not curve tests but, does allow you to complete homework assignments for extra credit. He does not post anything really ever and I recommend going to class to understand materials.
Super nice guy who really knows what he is talking about. He doesn't use powerpoints though and writes everything on the board so you have to go to class. He uses a lot of real world examples that make the content stand out. He uses his TA to give extra credit and quizzes.
Great teacher
I loved Kaplan! His lectures were interesting and there is limited to no homework. His tests are fairly hard but he only tests on what he teaches in class so if you go to class you'll be fine.
Dr. Kaplan is a great econ professor. However, you need to pay attention in lectures and take notes to do well. He drops one test and replaces it with your recitation grade, and homework is extra credit. That being said, the material can be difficult but the way he grades makes it easy to get a good grade. Take him!
I love Kaplan! He's a very relaxed professor with a great dedication to economics and his students.  Optional homework for extra credit, seems genuinely interested in helping, tests are not as hard as everyone says. His TAs are hot Don't even think about leaving early. He will call you out and embarass you. No yawning. No makeups for any reasons.
Jay is the man! You can tell he loves to teach this class (Money and Banking) and his lectures are awesome. I learned so much in this class that will be useful just in everyday life. I love how he wrote his own textbook and made it so affordable. He's always funny and engaging too, and it's a pleasure to come to class.
Microeconomics is definately a hard topic to grasp for the majority of people and this professor takes the time to make sure everyone is following up with the concepts. You will only be graded by what he covers in class, exams are not that hard. Jules is very funny and smart guy, I would definately recommend taking this class with him.
his test is very hard!!!!!
Jay was a great teacher when it came to being sociable and making his students laugh and feel involved in lecture. However, his teaching style made it difficult to get all the notes down and it seemed that over 1/2 of the material covered in class was not tested on. Very hard tests, only 3 per semester.
Great teacher, super hard tests.
I have mixed feelings about professor Kaplan. I learned a lot in his class, and I enjoyed his lectures. He incorporated current events to make the material relevant to society. However, his tests were difficult, so I relied on recitation and extra credit to save my grade even though I never skipped his class. Overall, difficult, but interesting.
Prof. Kaplan was an awesome professor! He helped made some difficult concepts/topics clear and concise. His lecture was usually a little over half way full and if you don't go to his class, you'll have a harder time passing as his tests are based solely off of what you learn in lecture. If you take him and show up for class, you'll do fine!
The exams are based on lecture, which he said repeatedly. Also, he assigned homeworks that were optional extra credit  worth two points each, dropped one midterm for recitation if its a higher grade and had great lectures using real-world examples. My friend and I both made great grades. Whiners probably skipped class b/c he doesn't take attendance
This was an Intro to macroeconomics class, but he taught us everything from his 4000 level banking class. He only curves kids 60%-78% to C's only to save himself so his "average" grade is a C. If you get a 78% he won't curve it to a B-. Worst teacher i have EVER had. Take any other teacher and I guarantee you , you will make the right decision.
Upper division teacher that shouldn't be teaching an intro class. He uses terms and words no one understands. He doesn't use a textbook or powerpoint or anything so if you skip class you're screwed. His tests are also hard. He does give extra credit so do every extra credit.
Teacher name: Bourdier, Juliette
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She is so exciting even teaching Medieval French. No one can make it come alive like she can. She does an amazing amount of preparation. I think she is the best prepared professor at College of Charleston, and she almost never gets a chance to teach the same class again, where other professors just dust off their old notes. The best ever!!
We read books, saw movies, court métrages with/without dialog, read bande déssinées. We learned critical thinking skills. I improved in thinking and expressing myself.  All of us did. She is amazing. We became a group of friends. We made movies from our papers interpreting Mme Tutli-Putli, a court métrage muet.  She could teach the phonebook. BEST!
AWESOME way to make learning grammar fun.  She used current French songs to illustrate the verb tenses and hard pronouns, so we learned about both grammar and French music.  Best teacher I have had at the College of Charleston and maybe ever because she really cares.  She is from Paris so we heard a good accent. French Again is her grammar website.
Although there were several sections of 202 and all used the same book, Dr. Bourdier used current pop songs and videos to illustrate the grammar, e.g. the various pronouns and verb tenses.  She is an awesome professor now at the College of Charleston in SC.  She cares about our progress and meets "face à face" with us to discuss our future. FUN
Hands down my favorite professor of all time. She cares deeply about her students' academic and personal lives. Get to know her, visit her outside of class, it makes a huge difference. We still keep in touch which I can't say for any of my other professors. She is an inspiration.
Now she teaches at College of Charleston.   She wants everyone in her class to love the French language and culture and goes to all extremes to offer us the opportunities to do just that. Extremely accessible by email and in her office. My speaking got better during this semester.  Now I definitely want to go to France for more practice.
College of Charleston-  Prof. Bourdier designed and taught a new course: French Journalism. The course allowed us to learn  about French news and culture of today. She is a superb teacher, the best  I have had. Her positive attitude is catching. She made this class fun, and we learned a lot about differences and similarities with US reporting.
She is French and different from Americans teachers. She is strict but nice. available, grades fast. very passionate.  gives lots of extra credit options. I didn't like the exams, she said that she took them from the book.  she is a ok grader. I think that she asked us too much for the presentation.  I will take her 314 class next year.
Nnow teaches at College of Charleston in SC. Unorganized and hates the textbook the school requires; instead teaches from her own lectures but tests on everything from the book. She tries to help by giving extra credit but makes the EC almost unattainable unless you have 6 hours a day to devote to just doing that. would never take her again
Fantastic and caring professor. She should be cloned. Gives her 170% if you give  your 70%. You will produce  a better paper than you thought possible. Don't miss the opportunity.
She can be harsh sometimes, but really dedicated and available. She taught me how to write my senor thesis. She taught me how to study and get focus. I recommend.
Madame you are my favorite teacher ever. You were very hard on me but I just got excepted in grad school. Thank you for making me redo my thesis over and over. Thank you for your letter of recommendation.
If you have to take a French class definitely hook up with this prof. If you have a hard time with French she will get you through it. She is readily available for help in class and before class. Very personable and wants you to pass. Her teaching style and pace is the reason I passed. MERCI MADAME
Prof Bourdier is the person who made me like la litérature médiévale. She cares!
Madame Bourdier is a hard worker who wants you to work hard too. besides that she is fun and she really cares. Can be harsh... don't take it personally, she still likes you.
She is an amazing teacher who truly care about the success of her students!
C'est la meilleure professeur! she cares, she makes us laugh and we learn/ super available but she can be strict and sometimes harsh
Madame Bourdier= the best ! I wish she had been my French teacher from preschool all the way up to the University level. She's very intelligent, can teach like no other, and has some great stories about France. If you're in her class, try hard and don't speak in English and you'll do great. Thanks for many great semesters Madame :) You're awesomeee
Madame, YA ROCK! (c'est triste que vous n'enseigne pas le semestre de Fall) Je ne crois pas que vous Ãªtes l'age de ma mÃ¨re :-)
I had Juliette in 2120, 2500, 3050, 3060 and this semester I am taking 3700. She is kinda though but very encouraging and can help with French and with choices in life. If I had to define her i would say that she is Wysiwyg
Teacher name: Asirvatham, Margaret
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Dr. Asirvatham was amazing, so caring and sweet! She made o chem (almost) bearable. Hope she has a good retirement
She doesn't really explain ways to approach problems well, so I always felt like class time was not being used well. Her exam averages were extremely low and she was completely fine with that. I'm trying to think about something positive to say, but I just had a bad experience with her overall.
Dr. Asirvatham has difficulty presenting what material will be on her tests well enough. Her presentations lack more complex examples for her students to practice with. If you took a chemistry class in high school, odds are this lecture will be much to easy for you. Make sure you show up to class because she gives a lot of clicker questions.
Great class. She really cares about her students and makes hard topics easy to understand. She asks for feedback and clearly takes it into consideration. Very organized, clear lectures. Always willing to help inside or outside of class.
Only good quality is her handwriting. Find another professor with better reviews. Should not be a teacher.  Confrontational, disrespectful, and does a poor job laying a good foundation for chemistry. Also has the final say in lab sections. Make sure you don't have the hardest grading TA, because she will also not take that into account.
I enjoyed Dr. Asirvatham! She cared for the students' success and she carried herself so professionally! She is very educated and a wonderful person. Chemistry is a difficult class, but if you put in the effort to succeed and communicate with the professor you'll be more likely to do well!
She was a great teacher, she gave many opportunities to be graded and evaluated unlike my other teachers. Content isnt hard just need to put in the work and not to mention she is a hottie. "Good morning"
She is horrible, do not suggest, I am not a fan. I will be failing this class because she explains absolutely nothing and the only way to learn to correct material to pass the exams is through other resources that don't involve the coursework. Probably the reason I hate my life so much this semester. If you have her I apologize for your life.
Professor is confrontational when you correct her, but refuses to admit to ever being wrong. There's no winning course of action while dealing with her if she's in a bad mood basically. And she will hold a grudge afterwards. Honestly just best to avoid her.  If you have to take the class other professors like Hendrickson or Nabilah are much better.
She does not explain new concepts well - if anything, she makes simple concepts more difficult to understand.  She is well-meaning but can become impatient with students' questions. You MUST be willing to teach yourself the material from the textbook to pass her class.  I highly recommend choosing a different professor if possible.
She futzes around topics and trying to teach you new ways to do something that already very simple. She spends way too much time trying to have perfect handwriting and gets grumpy when you ask questions, but she's passionate about teaching. If you're not a bio or premed student, she makes it pretty tough to apply to your field. Also: clickers :(
Everyone was confused, and it seemed like everyone I talked to did poorly. The first test had a 50 something average and she was okay with it
She is nice but the class is hard.
She's passionate for sure and will help if you do ask. However, lectures are unbearable. Doesn't make sense and has this tendency to shout into the microphone so re-watching her lectures online are even more unbearable. Her notes are scattered yet colorful, and will add whatever she thinks of anywhere she can find space. Recommend someone else.
She is a very good teacher but you have to really, really want to learn the material on your own. It's a huge class, so sitting in the front few rows helps (she will get to know your name). But sit in the back and it's not hard to get lost and lose motivation.
Worst professor I have ever had. Avoid taking this class with her if possible. You will not pass. Tests are hard, and contain content not taught in lectures, homework, or in the book. Her lectures make no sense, it is just 50 min of her writing scribbles on the projector. Going to class makes understanding harder. Avoid.
This class was an extremely difficult summer course but I imagine it would be much less intense over a spread-out semester. Exams are tough but fair and Dr. Asirvatham was very kind and a good teacher. That said, the class is definitely tough. Would recommend for a semester but not a summer course.
Worse teacher I have ever had. She is confusing and makes no sense. Her notes are scattered and doesn't explain concepts or use examples. Im learning from the book and youtube videos.
Asirvathim is a great orgo professor. Her tests and class are very challenging, but going to the help room and reading the text book will get you an A
Worst chemistry teacher I've ever had. She scribbles on a projector for notes, doesn't give examples, homework and tests are hard and she doesn't go over them. When people ask for her to slow down or explain she doesn't. And her accents unbearable.
Teacher name: Mertens, Billy
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Worst teacher I've ever had. Lecture notes are hardly explained, extremely sparse &amp; any math is done by him in class. The math he does do is very graph heavy, not helpful for application. Rude to students &amp; doesn't offer help if asked questions. Test q's are very hard to prepare for. Much learning comes from dense economic articles w/ no guidance.
Mertens believes that forcing students to adhere to his unforgiving and redundant teaching system is the best way to learn. He cites recent studies as evidence, and fails to take into account student learning styles. His attitude toward the class is rude, evident by his syllabus in which he mocks FAQs and threatens to lower grades for accidents.
online Econ class was absolutely awful. Assigns multiple chapters for one exam. Exam questions are nothing like the notes he posts online. Literally took him weeks to respond to multiple emails about questions and is not very helpful when you ask for reasoning or why something is as it is. Would highly not recommend.
Doesn't provide any feedback at all and is very hard to get ahold of
By far the hardest class I have taken. The professor is unhelpful and a tough grader. Very unfair. Avoid this course it will ruin your semester and stress you out.
Professor Mertens is a nice guy, but lecture notes and lectures are extremely dry. He makes you learn on your own by doing Group Assignments and isn't much help in the classroom.
The worst professor ever! I took his online class and I learned nothing, not helpful at all. Totally just wasted my money and time. If you want to learn something, don't take his class.
Just a very unhelpful professor. Will not be taking again.
Had him for 2010 online. He taught me nothing. All I did was read the textbook. Don't recommend taking his online course.
Bill is a great professor. Don't get me wrong, his classes are tough, but if you put in the effort you'll do fine. Lectures usually involve problems for solving in small groups, so he makes you think instead of just spoon-feeding you or just having you memorize the steps. Problem sets are given out only as exam practice.
Hardest teacher I have ever had, if you are not an applied mathematics major good luck, he assumes you know everything and moves at a very fast pace. Not helpful at all worst teacher i have ever had
Terrible, terrible professor. Calling him a professor would imply he taught me something, however. Avoid at all costs.
Grade is based only on midterms and in class assignments. He explains very quickly but always willing to go over things if asked. Very helpful and approachable, tests are tough, and posts review sets and their answers on d2l. Previous textbook ed is pretty much the same, which you'll use for problem reviews.
Best teacher I had at CU - by far. I think I asked for questions every day after class and he always took the time to explain more. Math doesnt come easy for me - but Billy made it easy.
I really enjoyed taking this class with Billy. He really knows the material and is very clear about what he expects from you on the test. Look at his study guides, look over the group problems,  and attend class regularly! As with most econ classes, spend more time on concepts, not on specifics. You should be able to get the grade you want!
This professor taught me nothing. His powerpoints are vague and uninformative, and he won't help you if you ask for it. Be prepared to learn everything by yourself, and don't expect him to tell you (even after you submit the tests and get your grades) what the correct answers should be. Absolutely terrible teacher
It was an online class and I understand a lot of that is figuring things out for yourself but his notes were so vague, they read as if I was supposed to know all this information already even though it was an INTRO class. When I asked for help he made me feel small and stupid. Terrible teacher. Just terrible
By far the worst teacher I have had at CU. Doesn't teach and expects you to know all the material. Billy simply review al the slides as if we all had prior knowledge. Billy also taught intermediate macro in an introductory course. Very confusing. He has officially made me hate my minor. Do not take his class, b/c you are better of teaching yourself
If I knew Billy was going to teach likes this I would have dropped his class in the first week. He just sits in his chair in the front of the room reading the lecture slides. He doesn't teach at all, more like he reads the slides and expects us to understand what he said. If you are in his class, you are better off teaching it to yourself.
Great teacher only for UPPER division. In his intro to Macro he almost always introduced a concept without fully explaining the what it meant or its purpose. Unfortunately he seemingly expected us to already have prior background knowledge- leaving us to teach ourselves the basic information, concepts and principals. Required a lot of outside work.
Teacher name: Morey, Edward
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Professor Morey, was a great professor and made glass enjoyable to go to. Although the course was very difficult in my opinion it really taught me a lot and made me more engaged and made me want to go to class more. I highly recommend taking professor Morey.
If you are taking this class as a major requirement do not take his class. He lectures were close to useless and the quiz/test questions (usually recycled) made no sense and hurt my brain to try to read. I've heard he is a good professor at an upper level, but he should not teach a principles class. You will have to work too hard for just average.
Morey's ECON 2010 class was by far the hardest class I have taken. The lectures are very full of material that isn't exactly relevant to the midterm or final. Although he is very willing to help you outside of class if you go to office hours, which is something I would recommend. And go to recitation as well, it will help your grade a lot.
I think people can take Edward's class and do well. His quizzes and tests get frustrating you just need to learn how to work with them. The most annoying thing about his class is it is YOU WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT GRADE YOU HAVE until the last the day of the semester.
Edward Morey was the most difficult economics professor I had at CU Boulder. Nonetheless, he was the best professor. Listen, economics isn't a breeze. This professor prepares you for REAL WORLD economics. Amazing dude, and hilarious at that.
One of the worst Professors I have ever had. "If you want to succeed on the Exams just memorize the past exam questions" - Edward Morey
Although I received an A+ in this class, Edward Morey is a bad professor. I will admit I found his classroom antics hilarious, but his in class examples were very poor representations of what you actually need to know. What I found most annoying was the fact that his test questions are essentially riddles with a vague bearing on Econ.
I can understand why most don't like Morey; they want to get good grades but don't want to work for it. If you're willing to put in your work (mainly reading the textbook and showing up to class) and really focus on the examples he gives in class, I promise this class will be manageable. He's also hilarious with a very non-PC type of humor, love it
Really just not a great teacher. Really did not enjoy the class. Tests were overcomplicated and confusing and his examples in class did nothing to help. Though if you study past exams you will do fine
Edward Morey- although trashed on this page, is by far one of the best professors I have had at CU boulder this year. He is smart, funny, and although intimidating- will help you out tremendously if you go to office hours.
Prof. Morey does not teach clearly, and assumes that we know more than we do for an 'Principles' class, even with the assigned readings.   If you are in this class, GO TO RECITATION!
His lectures are completely irrelevant to subject material on the exams. He gives odd inappropriate examples that do not make sense and only confuse the subject matter. His exams are a compilation of riddles only he knows the answers to and he gets a kick out of seeing how confused he makes his students with his nonsensical questions.
Boring
Took it as a Freshman, yet he teaches his classes as if we are all graduate students already able to understand ambiguous concepts. He resents Pre-Business kids looking to get at least a B- in his course to go into Leeds (AKA MOST OF THE STUDENTS TAKING HIS COURSE) and finds it fun to confuse students through the most riddling questions.
He is a cool guy but his tests are vey hard and confusing. What he lectured about never seemed to be on the tests.
Ed Morey is by far the greatest prof in the econ department. He is extremely intellgent and uses real life examples to make his points. His tests are hard but if you go into office hours he wants to help you and all of his past tests are on his website. Econ is clearly his passion and it shows. Good class.
Long boring lectures,  He takes attendence randomly  Tests are confusing
He gives really good examples in his lectures but none of them relate back to real micro. They are all about tequila and chocolate. The tests are basically 50 riddles vaguely about Econ. HE puts all his old tests online and pulled questions from those so if you can memorize 10 years worth of tests you are good. Attendance is graded for recitation.
Although he can be confusing at times, Edward posts every exam he has ever given on his webpage. Study those exam questions and your chances of passing increase significantly.  His unique personality is reflected in the examples that he uses in lecture notes. You could probably not show up and do well just by reviewing his lecture notes and exams.
He's a nice and relatively funny guy but his tests are impossible. His lectures are extremely long and are ususally pretty boring. Though I didn't do that bad in the class I deserved an A, and the only reason I got a B is because I completely failed the final. His test questions are like riddles and don't reflect your understanding for the content.
Teacher name: Walden, Glenda
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I'm taking Glenda as my internship advisor and I absolutely adore her. She is super down to earth and understanding and also has a good sense of humor. You can tell she definitely cares about her students and what she does. She made more interested in the field and was supportive in every way throughout.
She uses her college courses to advance her personal political agenda, even in courses without relevance with her agenda.
Dr. Glenda is an absolute charm, and anyone would be lucky to have her. Her lectures are engaging, fun, and great for taking into the real world. Very accessible outside of class, and always has great insight at office hours. Only one paper for the semester, which she gives the prompt for months in advance. Tests are hard, but manageable.
She is probably the worst professor I have had at CU. She is unable to keep her opinions out of lecture. I am not sure what her problem is with police officers, but she perpetrates the war on cops. She also equated people who text in her class to rapists saying texters do not understand boundaries. Unacceptable.
Glenda is the best! She makes the class material so interesting and funny. She offered three opportunities for extra credit (all easy) and is very easy to reach out to.
Glenda is a great and fair professor! She is extremely relaxed compared to your typical prof. This is a pretty easy and fun class to take. Very interesting material and great extra credit opportunities!
Glenda is an awesome teacher. I personally didn't do well in her class but it had nothing to do with her. You are graded on very few things (three tests, a paper, and attendance) so if you do poorly on the test it is hard to get a good grade. Her tests are all multiple choice. You don't know which days she is going to take attendance.
Glenda is a great professor. Her lectures are engaging and she is very knowledgeable about what she is teaching. She is a very fair person, if you take the time to go to her office hours with any problems she is very accommodating. Definitely do the readings if you expect to do well on the tests.
Take SOCY 1004 as an August semester, it is a lot of reading but it's interesting so it's not too hard. The test are straightforward and she gives out a study guide. Going to lectures are super helpful for understanding the theories and concepts. You can go into office hours if you need extra credit or if you want her to edit your papers.
Glenda is funny, compassionate, and engaging. Her class is not easy but what you put into it, you get out of it. She is very approachable and tries her hardest to offer extra credit, office hours, etc. The grading is a little harsh. Class is reading-heavy, but not impossible if you know how skim for important ideas. I'm happy I took her class.
Do not take a class with Glenda. Her lectures are vauge, however, she demands you know an infinite amount of information for the test. She even admits to trying to trick you on the test, making them very very hard. She will give you a study guide but it has 60+ broad questions. She can be funny at times, but it is not worth the bad grade and work.
If you want to be entertained take a course by Glenda Walden. I didn't read at all for this class and ended up with an A. She offers lots of extra credit opportunities and if you go into her office hours she is always super helpful. I was NEVER bored during her lectures, and that is saying a lot.
Glenda loves what she teaches but is a tough grader. Her lectures can be entertaining, but she was far from my favorite professor in the SOCY dept. This isn't a mess-around class.
This was just an internship credit course and she was simply grading papers on my experience but she is pretty scatter-brained. She's really nice and definitely wants to help. I met with her several times and she called me by a different name every time which made me feel really weird. But she gave me great sources for my lit review!
Glenda is the best teacher I've ever had, hands down. Class material is engaging and she keeps everything interesting. You'll be laughing one minute and then be  questioning your entire existence then next... Anyone deciding on taking a class with Glenda and is reading this review should look no further than the enroll button.
She's a fun lecturer but in this course specifically you learn nothing in class. Everything about your grade lies in the hands of a few papers and she has a 3-5 sentence rule for quotescitations. All about readings and no room to have your own opinions because its all based off how you can relate to readings.. its consciosuness.. that doesn't work
Glenda is a tough grader and can go off on tangents every now and then, but she's also very accommodating and does a great job of making her classes interesting.
I think Glenda is hilarious. She provides really funny and relatable examples for all of the material she presents in lectures, which is so helpful. She is very easygoing which creates a more relaxed classroom environment, and yet, she still has very high grading standards and makes you work really hard. Her classes are certainly not boring...
Glenda is amazing, Her classes are always awesome!
Glenda is wonderful. Hilarious and helpful she made me want to be at every single class
Teacher name: Paradis, David
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Do not take a class by him. Grades way too hard and is passive aggressive. I worked extremely hard and he gave me below average grades on everything I turned in.
Great guy and very intelligent, but horrible class. Would never recommend taking, his expectations are way too high for an intro level course and while this class was interesting... it was more stressful than anything else. If you are ready to work exceptionally hard it is possible to achieve an A, but be ready to WORK.
Dr. Paradis was one of my favorite professors I've had so far. He did a really great job keeping lectures interesting, and really made you think about the content he was teaching.
A terrible, horrible Professor. Very passive aggressive with students and a tough grader. Gave me a 55 on my first paper, did not put comments as to why, and then when i went to office hours to discuss, simply put the blame on his TA. Studied hard and make a 92 on his final, and the guy gave me a 79.9 in the course. Dont take this dudes class.
Has absurdly high expectations of students and piles on far too much work to keep up with. I have never received below a B on an essay and he gave me an F on my second essay after I followed the directions that he gave me off of my first essay. This class is way too difficult for what it is.
Really interesting lectures and is good at keeping you engaged in the material. Although he is a pretty tough grader. The class is basically just papers so if you're not a good test taker and like to write, he's probably a good fit for you.
Fair grader or papers. If you write clearly and actually read the book he gives pretty decent feedback. Easy class to get an A in if you do the work.
A great lecturer, but really prides himself on not giving out A's. Gives great feedback on your papers, but is impossible to improve. Frustrating when other friends are in a different HIST 3020 and are getting A's.... Smart man though.
As a senior this is the worst class I have taken at CU. Unreasonable grading, unreasonable grading. And an unfriendly unhelpful professor. DO NOT TAKE.
Great professor that really cares about the material. He makes the class laugh and portrays the information well. He is sometimes cocky and seems short with his students, but show up and study  a few hours you'll be fine. But does seem a lot for an entry level course. He should be teaching more upper level courses.
He seems like a nice person, and is interesting to listen to, but has some definite flaws. It was very hard to tell what was important information to copy down, making the quizzes harder than they should have been. He was also a very hard grader on essays, and often on criteria that hadn't been put forward.
Harsh grader. I got A's on both of my papers but people around me were receiving C's and D's for work that honestly should have earned at least a B in a 1000 level course. Online discussions were ridiculous and I never earned higher than an 80 despite fulfilling the criteria of what was expected in our submissions. Others liked him, to be fair.
Grades really tough especially with essays and tests. That being said the quizzes are relatively easy. The most important thing is to at least read spark notes and always remember to bring your clicker to class. He has usually 3 clicker questions per day that tanked my grade hard.
Very very tough grader and lectures are pretty confusing as to what is important and what to write down. He is a very nice guy and a very entertaining professor, but that wont help your grade any.
First off his papers are graded like this is a upper division history class. He often says, "I will grade like an intro history class." Then when you get feedback on papers he picks apart the smallest formatting details. Then in his lectures he doesn't use visuals well at all. Get ready to go to class and listen to him ramble for the full 50.
He grades very hard. I am a Biochem major and this class was my lowest grade. The final is pretty BS he gives you two essay topics and a list of terms, which sounds easy enough to prepare for. So, before class I did the whole test in my notebook, using the course books, then went to class and copied my very in depth answers and got a C-.
He's the person I aspire to be.
This is not the class you seek. Avoid this guy at all cost. This man is a very old school/subjective grader.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! Spent Couple hours on one paper and received a 65 with NO COMMENTS! Then, bs'd my final paper that was due, absolutely read ZERO from the book and received a B+. quizzes are absolutely stupid ridiculous for an intro course!! Look at the other reviews if your not a firm believer yet that this class blowsssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For a 1000-level history course, it was very hard. You really have to pay attention in lecture and work hard on the reading quizzesessays. I feel like I put in enough time and effort for an A, but I ended up with a B. He let's you know up front that he isn't an easy grader and he means it. He gives really good feedback though.
Teacher name: Chan, Steve
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
If you struggle with exams, don't take this class. Steve is difficult to understand and there are very few grades for the semester. If you do badly on one exam it is hard to recover.
I think he was a hilarious professor, but I understand the mixed reactions. You need to actually listen to what he says because his slides are normally just the terms you are going over. The actual application of the terms is in lecture. If you don't go to lecture, you'll probably be very lost.
The class has a lot of busy work. Recitations involve papers and group projects. The tests are pretty difficult. Chan is not a very good lecturer either. There is also a 12-15 page paper.
Steve Chan is very intelligent and knowledgeable within the theory realm of political science. But, this class is difficult and there is a lot of information to keep track of. It's an interesting class but not my favorite. You have to put in a decent amount of effort to get above a C. Chan is hard to understand as well....
Had him for a small lecture. Definitely need to review the terms he puts on the syllabus. During lecture, he kept calling us "stupid" which I think he meant as a joke, but it was annoying. He's a tough grader and doesn't give extra credit. Also, he didn't follow definitions from the book, he liked to make them up himself. Some of them were wrong.
Took the 5-week course, which was insanely paced. Assigns you to read 1 chapter/day and take a quiz on it. Offers 3 discussion for extra credit, two mandatory papers, and two exams (final, midterm). Offers almost no flexibility in his class, which defeats the purpose of an online class. His accent is heavy, so you have to rewind the lecture a lot.
Professor Chan is a great guy, he is enthusiastic about his class in international behavior and is very funny when it comes down to it. He is easy to follow in class, so long as you attend class and make yourself known he will take care of you in the long run. He is enjoyable to listen to and there are readings but they are discussed in class.
I had him in a small seminar class with about 15 people. It was definitely the best class I have ever taken. I've come out of the class feeling 100x smarter, yet 100x more stupid. He makes you re-think everything! The readings are long, but it is not essential to read every piece because we talk about them in class and the material is not tested on
I would only recommend Dr. Chan in a small seminar. We focused exclusively on journal articles (all free!). He is long-winded and talks more than he should for a "discussion," but he is very informed and approachable with questions. If you do the readings, make sure to understand them, and can write a strong and logical paper, you will be fine.
The main fault in this class is the variation in the recitation leaders so its important to talk to other students, also the tests are very comprehensive but for an introduction IAFS Chan was notibly intellegent and interesting. Not very helpful personally but very fair and clearly knowledgable. Go to lectures.
Prof. Chan is very confusing and hard to understand. He has minimal visual aids and is hard to pay attention to in class. I do not recommend this professor for anyone who is a visual learner. It is a bore and the tests are very hard.
He's very Love him or hate him. he uses lots of interesting analogies and sometimes goes on tangents in lectures. He tends not to go over the book in class and leaves that for your own time/recitations which i liked but may be a bother to other students
Very eccentric
This class is horrible. What we talk about in lecture barely shows up on the tests if at all. The tests are worded very poorly and he gives us no study guide material for this class so you have no idea what he wants for the test. I would not recommend this class to anyone.
This class is horrible. Chan jumps around from topic to topic and doesn't adequately tie concepts together. He speaks to the class as if we are complete idiots. One day he said, "I don't know if you know this, but the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore." This class is required for PSCI and IA majors, but try and take it with someone else if you can
Chan is an extremely captivating professor. He is eccentric and someone who can hold the attention of a 500+ person lecture class. He is a really nice and approachable professor. If you know the terms that he writes on the board and how the relate to each other you will do fine on the exam. He's great and hilarious!
Mr. Chan is a sweet man and covers a lot of information. He also repeats himself over and over again to try and drill in his points, which can be annoying. Overall he's easy
This class was ridiculous and terrible. What we talk about in lecture barely shows up on the tests. The tests are worded poorly and he gives no study guide material for this extremely broad class so you have no idea what he wants for the test I don't think he even knows he is really hard to read. He seems sweet but in reality is rude and arrogant.
I'm a political science major and this class made me want to switch majors. Very nonspecific about study materials [anything said in lecture, anything read in text] and he jumped around during lectures making it hard to keep track of things. good analogies. Lots of jargon. making flashcards of the terms goes a long way.
Chan has a lot of good info to share in the classroom, but is also sort of eccentric and all over the place when lecturing. He uses a lot of irrelevant analogies and can make things harder than they need to be. I happen to like eccentricity, but if you don't find another professor.
Teacher name: Cundiff, Mel
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He sets you up to fail on the tests bc his slides are so disorganized &amp; hard to read. If he edited his slides then it would be easier to study for the tests. Sure, he's a nice guy, but the first day of class he tells the students that only half will receive A's&amp;B's &amp; the rest will get C's,D's,&amp;F's. Tests are curved bc everyone fails.
Lecture's are dry and boring. Slides are disorganized and he often goes on long tangents about things that are not on exams. The only grades are 2 exams (which are held outside of class) and a final exam. He reviews his last lecture for the first half hour of class so you will get the same amount of info going once a week and you will save time.
Think you study hard and then the tests are completely random and you can't understand anything
Don't waste your time by attending lecture- just teach yourself from his lecture slides. Tests are very hard and ask specific facts that you most likely didn't study. Take advantage of the old exams that he posts b/c usually the current exam will ask the same exact questions. This is basically a self-taught class, don't try to give Mel a chance.
I only went to lecture 3 times all semester because it is a huge waste of time. Mel's slides are posted online and in class he just makes everything more confusing or will put you to sleep. Tests are very difficult and ask weird, specific questions about random facts he includes on his slides. Worst class I've ever had.
This class was my worst class of my second semester. I really hope that future students of CU who are in need of a science credit won't make the same mistake I did and take this class. He is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He is the most monotone speaker- his classes are irrelevant because he just reads off of the slides- don't take it.
Worst professor I have ever had at CU. He makes no effort to get into his contact with his students, his entire lectures are based on slides you can access online, and the grade of the course is 2 midterms and a final. Not to mention, he makes numerous mistakes in lecture, therefore providing his students no incentive to go to class. Truly awful.
If you enjoy sleeping in class, this is the class to take.  Every time I went to class at least 6 people were asleep.  The good thing about this class is that you never have to go to class to understand the material, it's in his powerpoint online.  Just watch out for his tests, he asks very specific questions so make sure you study.
If you're taking a heavy semester, be warned do not take. If you are not a auditory learner, don't take. If you can't stand monotone or self focused lectures, don't take. If you hate contradiction in lectures then, don't bother.    He attempted to teach things he had no clue on, example being ATOC course work. Can't answer questions at all.
I took tropical marine ecology hoping it be an interesting class; however, Mel managed to make this class horrible. He has been teaching the same lecture for 20 yrs. He goes straight off of the slides and doesn't engage the class at all. The tests are extremely tough and all specific fill in the blank questions. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS
Why all the hate for mel?  He is a really nice guy! Sure, class is boring, but if you show up and take notes you are almost guaranteed a B or above in his class.  Tests are based entirely on lecture slides.  Dont buy the book - it's useless. He curves tests heavily, and it is easy to do well in his class.  Plus he is a really nice guy!
Super nice guy, the tests aren't hard. Drink an energy drink before class though.
Class isn't hard if you just study the slides but the actual class time is pretty much useless.  I never went and still ended up with an A in both parts of the class, but every time I went to class just felt like a waste.
ONLY good thing are his exams are all based on the lecture slides &amp; he posts them online. However, he was 4-5 weeks behind in his lectures and is just now speeding through to catch up, making this final having a ridiculous amount of info to study. Haven't been to lecture since September, got a C on the 1st exam, B on the 2nd w/huge curve.
His class is sooo boring. Monotone voice, not exciting... makes you fall asleep. Also his tests are super difficult. Half the things were only slightly mentioned in class and not on the power point at all. All fill in information, very specific and no multiple choice. The worst. Take a different class.
Mel is adorable (he invited the entire class to his Thanksgiving dinner) but his lectures SUCK and his tests are THE WORST. I got a D in EBIO 1040 and now I have to take it in my final semester to get credit for my major. Please take gen bio... Perhaps it's harder but it's not taught in an archaic style/the tests reflect the material.
This class is painful to sit through...his slides are a mess, his voice is impossible to hear (and he sounds like yoda), and it is impressively boring...I've never had a class where I physically wanted to run out and away from the building.
Mel has great stories to share and always makes himself laugh. Sometimes he changes things up, but other than that the tests are 100% off the lecture power points and very boring. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you want a good laugh its nice to go. His tests are challenging, but if you study and review the practice tests they are manageable!
Great professor with a ton of drive.  I'm not sure shy people are ragging on him so badly but if you sit anywhere in the front 10 rows you can hear him just fine.  Probably has the most life experience in and out of the subject out of anyone that I have ever met.
WORST PROFESSOR I have had in my four years of attending CU Boulder. I took his Coral Reef Ecology class which consists of one week of in class lecture + one week in Cozumel. Sounds like a great class right, Cundiff managed to make it not only a terrible trip, but ruined the potential for any 'fun' you think you would have. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES!
Teacher name: Acevedo-Munoz, Ernesto
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Ernie is tough, I like his personality. I like him. But him as a teacher is super rough. In this Latin American cinema class he made it super obvious how poorly he felt about US culture in comparison to LA culture. This was a huge turnoff, especially as a American student. I did learn lot in this class and enjoyed the content....
I personally think he is a great professor. If you walk in late however, he will stop talking and stare and you. There are only tests to grade you and he does have some really random questions, like "Who is the editor of the movie Jaws." PAY ATTENTION and TAKE GOOD NOTES on EVERYTHING that comes out of his mouth. Strict on the outside, nice inside.
I read the other reviews on here and thought that I would hate Ernesto, but his class was by far the best I've had at CU. He can be rude, but that's part of his sense of humor and he makes the material so interesting. His tests are also super easy if you pay attention and go to class. I would highly recommend taking anything that he's teaching.
Hard, but fair. Knows a great deal about film. Favorite film is the Little Mermaid.
Not a cool guy. Ernesto is an arrogant man who puts his students on a level below him. He refuses to be wrong, and will say things to piss you off. The tests aren't hard, but they're tricky: you have to memorize a random crew member from each film you watch. Overall, the class was ok, but Ernesto was unbearable.
Ernesto is an awesome professor; he is funny, engaging, and makes the material enjoyable. But, HIS CLASS SUCKS AND YOU SHOULD AVOID IT. Why?  He does not use D2L so you have to guess as to what your grade is. Quizzes and tests are extremely difficult because the questions are extremely subjective and obscure. Almost impossible to get an A.
Professor Acevedo-Muñoz scared me at the start. He doesn't allow phones at all, and doesn't like students who go think they know more than him when it comes to film. But as time goes on, you realize he's just tough to start to weed out people who aren't serious about film. Go to class, pay attention, and you'll be fine. In the end, great professor.
Ernesto is amazing!  You would be so lucky to have him as a professor for any film class.  He will make sure to get to know your last name, so GO TO CLASS.  He lays out everything you need to know for his class so, if you go to class and take good notes, you will do well.
It is sad to see educators today who don't know what the word "education" means. Ernesto was my least favorite professor this semester because of his lack of knowledge on the subject and disregard for feedback or student progress. His tests are terribly structured in subjective essay grading where he expects students to guess what he is asking for.
Hilarious and really explains the material thoroughly. Reading the book is only necessary for the first two quizzes. GO TO CLASS! He had 3 pop quizzes this semester in order to reward the kids who go to lecture. No matter how big the lecture, he will know your name &amp; know if you dont come to class!
By far my favorite professor at CU. He comes off as arrogant, but once you get to know him he's an extremely nice and funny guy. He keeps lectures interesting and i never got bored. As long as you attend class, you dont need to read the book at all. No matter how big the class is, he will know your name, so i recommend going to class
Ernesto was one of my top five teachers at CU. I started off disliking him immensely because his jokes are often rude and his opinion is fact. But by the end of the semester, I had a new and deep appreciation for film. I learned so much in his class because he demanded so much from his students-you have to pay attention and can't help but learn!
He knows his stuff. He's the best professor I've ever had.
he is extremely funny and he know what he is talking about. any hard headed people should not take this class because  his opinion is a fact in his world. But his class is definitely worth taking.
He knows what he's doing.
Not sure what the class #s were when I took them.  All I can say is that Ernesto opened my eyes to more things than any teacher or professor in my education.  Ernesto is the reason to be in the Film Program.  The reason to go to CU for Film if you choose too. He is honestly one of 2 teachers in my life that shaped my world view.
This guy is the real deal.
He is the best at CU.
Often presents personal opinion as fact. He has a good sense of humor (mostly) and teaches you what you need to know if you go to his class. He does think very highly of himself, but if you can filter that, his class can be enjoyable.
This guy was hilarious. Class is really easy if you just memorize the info on his power point presentations...most of this stuff is on the test so take notes. Also, pop quizzes come up every now and then. Just show up...come on it's film class. Really funny guy though.
Teacher name: Ulbrich, Ingrid
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Ulbrich is an awful teacher. She refuses to lecture, and instead makes the students work on busy work for the entire period. She asks for advice to improve the class, and rejects any ideas that require her to put forth effort. She refuses to work with students who have complaints. I should have dropped the course.
So disorganized. Too many learning tools teaching completely different concepts, and there's nothing tying it all together. She hasn't lectured once because she thinks "students don't learn anything in lecture". We work on worksheets in teams every class. I'd have no idea what's going on if I didn't watch recordings of other professors' classes.
Passive aggressive, you can't ask questions until after class, when you get the chance, she answers questions with questions. Talks about our feelings rather then actual chemistry. Treats all students as children, which is degrading and offensive. Had no takeaway from that class. Pointless and a fair amount of homework 5/7 days.
Her notes were incredibly hard to follow and the tests in this class are extremely difficult. The tests are designed to trick you even if you know the material. Her lectures are incredibly unclear and most of the material covered in the lecture is not even on tests. Avoid taking her class if you can.
Very unorganized, doesn't post notes, extremely passive aggressive. Take any other gen chem teacher and you'll get a better grade.
The class is difficult, but if you put the time in you will get results. As for Ulbrich, do not take her class unless there is no other option. Unclear in lectures and the test are not over anything that is taught.
She can not teach. She's confusing and is very slow and does not get to the information we need to know. She also treats students like we are back in middle school which is very annoying. Inn general she is not respected by students and she should not be.
Absolutely the worst teacher I have ever had.  She took pride in making things way too difficult, and had a general bad attitude about teaching the class.   The tests were next to impossible.
I don't know why she got so many bad reviews. Yes, the class was challenging, but no more so than other chemistry classes. I thought she explained things pretty well, and she helped me when I asked.
She teaches well, but misleads her students into thinking that exams only cover lecture material when it is only briefly covered on exams. Often, most of the test covers foreign material that was never even discussed in class. Also, she words the exams in a non-understandable way, and doesn't give straight answers to questions asked in class.
She taught well in class, but she totally misleads her students into thinking that exams only cover lecture. The majority of the time, there was stuff on the exams that was not even covered in lectures. I don't want to be tested on foreign material! Also, she didn't always give straight answers to questions asked in class, which was frustrating.
While this class was one of the most challenging in my academic career, professor Ulbrich has the uncanny ability to fully teach all of the challenging material in her class. She provided students with as much help as they needed and her well organized class well-prepared me for other chemistry courses. She was not only a genius but also kind.
Chemistry classes are supposed to be difficult but avoid her classes if possible. The exams are ridiculous. A low D average is acceptable for her.
Worst teacher ever.  Not flexible, confusing as hell, and inconsiderate.  DON'T EVER TAKE HER CLASS UNLESS  YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TOO!
A frustrating teacher to have for an upper division class. Does not come prepared for classes, barely knows the material and commands no respect over the classroom. Don't be surprised when the tests are on material barely covered and make no sense. She overall is one of the poorest instructors I have ever had.
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Never in my academic career have I had to endure such incompetence from an educator. Ingrid Ulbrich makes this course ridiculously more complicated than necessary, and ruined what could have been a pleasant class for me. She deliberately tests students on material she does not teach, and, in short, does not do her job.
Doesn't teach what is on the exams. Class is damn near pointless to attend. Doesn't answer questions clearly. Exams are confusing and no review guide is provided even though the class has hardly any guidelines to begin with. She's awful. Find another professor to take this class with.
She didn't answer questions during lecture.
Chem is not an easy subject, but she does her best to explain the topics and help students get good grades. If you pay attention in class you'll know what will be on the tests. She's completely reasonable and I did very well in the class without devoting all my time to Chem.
Dr. Ulbrich was a fantastic instructor.  She designed the course around the interests of the class and used actual research problems from the students as homework.  We learned enough in class to do the homework, but we weren't spoonfed the material, nor was the homework a regurgitation of lecture material.  This was my favorite class at CU.
Teacher name: Bhat, Sujeet
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Overall amazing professor
Excellent professor, clear lecture and easy exam.
Excellent professor, I took his Calc 1 and Calc 3. His legendary "are you with me" is still in my mind.
Awesome professor. He didn't let the idiots interrupt him in class and he was always available in office hours if you had any questions or needed any help.
Literally the most amazing professor I've ever had. Cleared up in 50 minutes what has baffled me for over 3 years
I have now taken APPM 1350, APPM 1360, APPM 2350, and APPM 2360. Out of all four classes, Bhat by far was the best professor I had. Really makes clear examples and goes in depth. I learned stuff for real for the first time in that class.
Very engaging and helpful teacher. His lectures always have the best analogies, and he manages to make even the most difficult content appear conquerable.
He's really funny and easy to follow along with. You can make his lecture a drinking game for every time he says "Are you with me?" You definitely have to put time in outside of class or you won't pass, but a pretty standard math class with a dope teacher. Also don't buy the textbook because it comes with your webassign login
Wonderful in lecture for a calc class!  Our time was filled with students on the stairs with people from other professor's lectures.
Dr. Bhat is very energetic in lecture and goes over good examples while explaining every part of the problem. He will definitely help you have a good semester.
Sujeet is literally the best professor at this school. He wants you to learn and he will help you get there. This class was really hard (class average at around a D) but he curves and you really enjoy the class anyway! Which is saying something. He's the greatest.
Sujeet is a kind man and a wonderful teacher. He truly cares about his students and will do his best to explain things. I enjoyed all of his lectures, and his teaching style is both hilarious and clear. The only complaint is the way he structures office hours. He only works with one student at a time on just one problem that many have questions on.
Awesome
Sujeet is the best! He is a funny and engaging lecturer who almost always gets his point across. His tests are extremely difficult, though, so it'll take a lot of work (he writes every test though, so you're not escaping this by getting a different teacher). It's better to have the professor who actually writes the exam. Definitely recommend!
He is a great professor, and his class is very interesting,  but his tests are so tough.
I had always assumed my math professors in college would be dry, boring people. Sujeet proved me wrong. He's hilarious, has a very deep knowledge of what he's teaching, and teaches with precision. Honestly, I look forward to his class and would highly recommend.
Gives very clear lectures, helps you if you need it. Also he writes the tests so he tells you what you need to learn in lectures.
Sujeet is the MAN! He is the best math teacher I have ever had by a long stretch. He writes pretty tough tests, but if you take 5-6 practice exams and attend every class and don't nod off you can do well in the class.
Sujeet can do no wrong. He's the best math teacher you'll ever have.
One of the only teachers of math that can make it funny and somewhat interesting. I enjoyed his lectures, he is very funny. I have a lot of respect for Sujeet.
Teacher name: Adams, William
School name: University of Colorado - Boulder
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
His slides are mainly pictures of various biological processes that makes it extremely difficult to take notes on ahead of time like he suggests. However, he is very good at explaining the topics in lecture. My advice: go to lecture and listen to try to understand and do the clickers and then re-watch the lectures and take notes at home.
really funny and cares a lot about Bio, but he knows the material so well, it 's often hard for him to explain it to students who don't understand. clicker questions every class, and homework every week, exams are extensive. but he's a good guy.
This class is extremely difficult for a 1000 level course, especially if you don't come in with lots of previous knowledge of bio. He is a very nice and friendly guy, but he moves through the slides so quickly that it is impossible to keep up, and they are very unorganized which makes it difficult to take efficient notes.
One of my favorite teachers, very nice and really helpful.
Professor Adams is a hilarious and sweet man that really lightens the mood. At one point he dressed up as a gangsta to rap this song about biology. It was hilarious and really showed William cares about his students. He just has issues displaying information because he knows it so well.
Solid professor. Has a habit of going on tangents that are related to the subject, lots of stories, but all of them are fairly quick and many funny. Nice guy, really good at explaining the material; answered questions even I didn't know were answerable in the scope of the course. Do note: Classes heavily rely on in-class, powerpoint is gospel.
He was very entertaining. He does go through lectures pretty quickly but that is normal for a huge lecture class. The exams can be tough but they were online so you can have your notes accessible just in case. The content is tough but he made it fun. I was sad to see the switch of professors halfway through the semester.
I'm so glad I had Adams first semester of freshman year. He made a class I thought would be difficult fun and far easier. He and another prof switched halfway through the semester, but I'm happy I had Adams for at least a bit.
DO NOT take this class unless you already have taken an intro biology and intro chem class. This class is SO much more difficult than an intro bio course. Professor adams is very nice and sweet but his course is in no way an intro bio course. If you don't have a solid understanding of biology before this course you will not do well.
Adams taught the first half of the semester and Taylor taught the second half. Don't let the easy clicker and homework questions fool you, the tests are very difficult. You have to pay attention and study hard to do well. Challenging but not the hardest thing ever. I would've gotten a better grade if I put more effort in
William is very funny &amp; makes lectures interesting. But, I believe this class was way too hard for an entry-level biology class. The tests are very difficult and they go way deeper into concepts than we ever covered in class. Using the book helps, although it's not required. Be prepared to do everything online.
Great Professor who is really good at explaining concepts in lectures. covers all the details you will need to know for the tests. He is very kind and speaks with tone that makes it hard to fall asleep, always engaged.
Very good instructor. Attendance was not mandatory, but he does use iclickers. He's fun and very passionate about his lectures, which helped to make them more interesting. He was very clear and thorough with his explanations and was always willing to help clarify any confusion. Would strongly recommend.
Very funny. Makes the lectures interesting and talks a lot about his own experiences. He's very lenient on homework; you get like a week for each assignment, and he's great at watching out for questions and does his best to answer them. Make sure you go to class, because clickers are a huge part of the grade and there are tons of them.
Professor Adam taught the first half of the course this semester and was fantastic! Not only does he really enjoy his job and is passionate about the lectures, he makes plenty of time for students after/outside of class for help. One of my favorite teachers so far! Very quirky and wears a polo and fanny pack almost everyday. Note: LOVES plants!
Professor Adams taught the first half of the course and he was awesome! He is a very enthusiastic lecturer and clearly loves what he is doing. My favorite attribute was the fact that he wears a fannypack everywhere! Overall though, this class isn't too bad at all. Show up, take notes and get clicker points, and this year the tests were even online!
Fantastic teacher, very helpful, always in a good mood, reliable.
An amazing professor who cares so much about his students. I was so sad to see  him leave halfway through to switch profs. I hate the subject but he made it click of me. I'v never had a more engaging teacher.
Dr. Adams is great at making extremely boring and dry material very entertaining at least. As long as you pay attention in lecture the tests aren't hard at all. Terrific professor. The fanny pack is just an added bonus.
Dr Adams is a great teacher. He does make it easy to get some grade padding clicker questions in class and is super passionate about what he teaches. Tells you exactly what will be on the test, but that doesn't mean it's easy.
Teacher name: Rustici, Thomas
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Thomas Rustici is the second worst Professor I have taken at George Mason University. He does not lecture in a way that provides comprehensive notes. He also participates in unethical, unprofessional racketeering tactics by forcing you to purchase his books, and you CANNOT pass his course without them. He is an intelligent, funny guy, bad prof.
I hated his class while I was taking it, but I came to appreciate it after I was done. His class toughens you up, especially if you're a freshman. Yeah it's hard and you'll probably fail an exam or two before you learn how to pass his class, but Rustici is one of those profs that you just have to experience at least once while in college.
Prof. Rustici is hands down the best professor I've ever had. I had no idea how interested in economics I was until I took this class. BEWARE: If you hate/can't understand basic economics, this class will be a nightmare with this professor. However, if you're okay with econ, prepare to be given the equivalent of Ted Talks each and every lecture.
I started this class quite frightened by all the reviews people gave him. But, he ended up being one of the best professors I had last semester. I leanred so much in such a short time, but that came with putting in a lot of effort into studying for his class and some failure along the way. I would recommend that all students take his class once.
-Rustici knows what he's talking about, but sometimes it can be a pain to follow along. -His lectures are entertaining and filled with information. -He doesn't coddle you and let's you decide what you will get out of the course. -Definitely did not feel like a 100-level course. -Exams are the only graded material: go to class and study!
Nightmare exams that are worth all of your grade. If you have the option to take a different professor do it, but if you get stuck with Rustici, be prepared to take notes. The textbook(s) are not needed except the one that he wrote because those have test question answers in them. Use koofers for help with exams.
Attending Rustici's class is like attending a TED Talk almost every time. It's too bad it's overshadowed by the nightmare that are his tests. Study hard and try to practice previous exams you get back. His tests are really unique but if you get them you will do well.
Took econ 103. He often spends the majority of the class talking about barely related experiences and jokes. Very hard tests, study the equivalent of the time in class to get a decent grade. Avoid this teacher to avoid an extremely difficult semester. Retaking next semester.
Almost everything on the tests are going to be from his lectures. Gives some extra credit out on tests. Four tests whole year: Test 1,2,3, and Final. Tests have tricky wording. Almost everybody fails. This is a weed out class for the School of Business!
Although I am not a fan of the way he structures the class, he is one of the best lecturers I've ever come across, immensely motivational. If you are willing to stay on your toes and try to understand why the correct answer is the right one, you will not have a problem.
4 exams; the exam answers are literally from the lectures. He is hilarious, I am prior enlisted in the military and when he cursed or told us stories I cracked up. Very helpful- SAVE all exams &amp; have a question ready. Lots of extra credit- do all of them. I started with a 62 15%, 51 20%, 76 25% final is 40% of the grade but I got a C overall
His lectures are amazing, but his exams are cumulative and tough. Exams 1-3 are 20% and the final is 40%. I did well on the written portion (short essay questions w/ some graphs and explanation + extra credit), but I failed the multiple choice portion. I know its a lot but its worth doing the readings and getting lecture notes. Record the lectures!
Make sure to take detailed notes and I recommend recording the lecture and taking notes off of the recordings, not in class, because this will help you pay attention to the actual lecture since youre gonna listen to it twice. Study previous exams, dont just memorize them or youre screwed. Avoid him if possible bc its not worth the stress.
The lectures are good. The tests in my opinion do not reflect material covered in the lecture. Not just multiple choice questions and the grading is done by teacher's assistant.
I took Rustici for Micro and Macro, and got a relatively high grade in Micro but Macro was close to impossible. This man goes through material SO fast and didn't bother explaining or writing anything in 104. Exams will ask about the most intimidate details barely gone over in class. Even if you study and enjoy Econ, do not take him for Macro.
Dr. Rustici's Econ classes are the most challenging, but they have been my favorite. Read the material, go to all the lectures, and visit office hours if you don't understand. Also, go over tests, each exam builds on the one before; if you don't fix the mistake, you'll keep making it. Also, do not miss an opportunity for extra credit on exams!!!!!!
Econ 103 with Rustici is a challenge. Some of the exams are challenging and the tests are only part of the grade. There are also a lot of textbooks to read. Make sure to study a lot. However, Rustici does give funny lectures and he is willing to help the challenging material at his office hours.
Great professor in my eyes, notoriously-hard exams but phenomenal lecturer and very respected in the economics field. You can slide without buying any of the four textbooks. If you're in the honors college go to the recitation - it REALLY helps. Study his previous exams if you want to pass (although I do not know how much longer this will work).
If you don't mind basing your entire grade for the class on four exams then go ahead and take him.
This class is way too difficult for a 100 level course. I find it troubling that he makes it so difficult, considering that most students in this class aren't econ majors. The only grades for the entire semester are the four exams he gives. Don't choose him for this class unless you want to regret your decision and hate your life.

Teacher comments: 
You should get an A in this class if you do the work. The solutions to the homework are given to you and if you do all the test practice problems you will be ready for the test. The lectures are sometimes a little boring because he read off of the slides a lot. He is kinda funny and will remember the students names who show up to class.
In order to do well in this class, you really have to put in a lot of time and effort. Unlike other classes, this course starts out pretty difficult and then gets easier as the semester goes on. A crazy high number people fail the first test (I failed the first test also) but you can still get an A if you do well on the other 4 tests.
The class is easier than what he makes out to be. Stay focused, do the homework, attend recitations, and you'll be solid. Before the exams, make sure you do ALL of the practice test bank problems. There are no surprises on the exams; it's extremely similar to the practice problems. The professor goes fast so you might want to read the notes ahead.
Pilloff makes everything understandable, truly a great teacher. Do all the graded assignments, a little of the test bank problems, and all the practice tests and you will succeed. He has solutions for every type of problem if you get stuck. Exams reflect the practice tests. You can skip class by just watching his online lectures.
Testbanks is your best ally here. UNDERstand them. Do not memorize. Each choice in the multiple choice exams is possible answers when you use a different mode or sign. I wish his exams would require solutions so that the effort to solve the problem will be considered. Process over product. Work hard for this class and you'll pass.
Don't get me wrong, he's an amazing professor but the class is very difficult. He gives everything you need to pass but you will need to spend majority of your time for this class. Also, practice test banks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The practice tests are your best friend in this class, so long as you practice those and understand the logic behind each question, you should do very well on the tests. Also Pilloff has a rule where you're free to attend any lecture you choose, so long as you take your tests in the class time slot that you're signed up for. Very good guy, 10/10.
He provides more than an adequate amount of material to succeed in this class (practice tests, HW problems). I took it online but through his recorded lectures and brief interaction seems like a nice guy. Key is to stay on top of HW and practice the test bank Qs religiously. The class is time-consuming but not overly difficult.
This course took more effort than I expected. Although you have the test banks you really have to understand it. Attendance not mandatory and the practice tests helped me most.
TEST BANKS, TEST BANKS!! Im not a finance major, but im doing relatively well in this class by doing the test banks over and over. Pro tip is to not MEMORIZE the problems but to UNDERSTAND them! Pilloff is very organize with the way he teaches the class. He posts EVERYTHING you need on blackboard. Just commit a lot of time and effort to the class!
This is a very difficult class. You would probably spend all your semester studying for this class. The professor is average ( he just reads off the power points) but the way the course is structured, in my opinion is not the right way. 100 questions study guide each test.... Unfortunately, not too many options for finance.
Dr. Pilloff is the best finance professor in Mason. His classes are always taken, so get him before you miss out. He really wants us to succeed, giving us practice test banks and extra credit (for just filling out the scantron info correctly!). He's got video lecs online so you can skip and make up classes. Just don't slack. Keep up with hw.
In addition to the below comment, Pilloff is an awesome professor I have at GMU by far!! U dont necessary need to come in for lectures bc he post EVERYTHING you need on blackboard. Common reason why people do poorly in this class is bc they did not commit enough time and effort. I cant stress enough to say DO the test banks and KNOW them by heart
First time taking finance and I was stressed out on how am I going to do in this class, however, I follow other's advice which is TEST BANKS. I got A's on the first 2 exams so far with the cycle: 1. Look and UNDERSTAND how to do the test banks 2. Do the HW on your own 3. Do the practice MapleTA prob and repeat. Treat this class as your daily habits
Took this in the summer, this course was a lot of work but do able. We covered a lot information daily so be prepared to read and do the problems. He also offered video lectures that really helped me understand better, so attendance is not mandatory. test are 10 problems each with the final been 20. If you can take him, he really knows his stuff.
Practice, Practice, and Practice. I failed the first exam bcz I did not know what to expect. After the first exam, I practiced every day and got 90-100 every exam.
Prof Pilloff is genuinely a highly knowledgeable and smart person. He has a very clear grading criteria and test bank problems from which he draws exam problems. He is always willing and ready to help but he expects you to put in effort to understand the material instead of learning by heart. TEST BANK PROBLEMS WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE!!!!!
He's the best professor I've taken at mason. He's very knowledgeable and knows his stuff. He's a great teacher. He really cares for his students and want them to succeed. Go to his office hours or TAs for extra help. Don't miss his class and pay attention. A lot of homework but it's not too hard. Study test banks for exams. Take him!
Attendance is mandatory but you should show up since he helps you during class with all the lecture problems. This class is doable in 5 wks if you put forth 100% effort. Do test banks and understand them not memorize. Homework helps to get you going then test banks help to make the processes click. Lowest test grade is worth the least, it helps.
He knows his stuff breaks it down to make u understand the concepts not just formulas. I took the class in the summer so we covered ALOT of stuff in a short period. Attendance not necessary since video lectures are posted after class, you have to put in effort to pass. I think all finance classes grade the same. If you try you should do well.

I did this for extra credit. Public goods lol
Has many real life examples applicable to Economics. Great story teller and well worth taking his class. Although the final is 40%, he does go over the final study guide in class. Need to go to class to do well
meh not the best. in order to get an A u need over 94%
Dr. Thomas is a great professor.  The incentive to show up to class is quizzes he gives every week.  If you buy the Gregory Mankiw study guide for the class, and study the study guides within, you will most likely pass this class with an easy A.
He has quizzes regularly and there are not very many points in the entire class so be careful! The final is 40% of the grade. Study guide is VITAL. I recommend starting a Quizlet at the beginning of the semester and adding on questions and answers for every chapter. Very interesting lectures to start off your day and get your brain churning.
He is extremely smart and is a great teacher. I learned more in one week with him  than I did a whole semester in 201. The quizzes come straight from the study guide, he wants you to do well and actually learn the material. I would highly recommend him!
Mr. Thomas is always available to help with any material. He wants everyone to pass
Great professor. I think everyone should take this class. I highly recommend it!
Great professor, really love his class.
ECON 335 by Dr. Thomas( I think he would like this new title) has been considered as one of the cost-effective classes by me as a student out-of-state. Totally love his teaching style!!!! Have learned a lot through one semester. Unfortunately, he is leaving Mason.
You need to go to class, because you do not know when he will give you quiz.
Interesting class, you will get great grades!
Inspirational!! Great professor!!
If you go to the class, you will get a great grade!
Cool professor, really help you!
Great teacher!! give many extra credits!!
Really popular and kind teacher, you will learn a lot in his class.
The Greatest Professor and most enjoyable class ever! I even start loving writing this semester because of assigned 12-page case study. A+!
Great Class!! He gave pop quiz but dropped the  two lowest grade.
Interesting class, but he will leave mason, feel sad.

Teacher comments: 
Terrible Professor. Terrible attitude. Not Helpful at all. Exams are hard.
During lectures, she was repeatedly rude and condescending to students. Tests are pretty straightforward. Weekly homework and quizzes on WileyPlus.
Took this class 2x, once online and another physical lecture. I don't advise taking this class online AT ALL. She gives very little guidance even to her students attending the in-person lectures, so taking it online is harder. Your TA in recitation will likely be the one to rlly teach you everything so ATTEND RECITATION! That will save&amp;help you!
If you take this professor plan to study more than usual. The problems gone over in class don't go in to enough detail and you may feel rushed. The professor is very competent in her field. That being said she may be forgetting that this is possibly the first accounting class some students have taken.
She is a really tough grader. You can never pass her class with an A period. My manager gave the best midterm and final review and still, I got 89% Even my manager got mad for her giving me 89%. You have to write 6 Journals (30%), a research paper (30%), a research topic, which she will never accept the first time (5%), and two manager reviews (40%
DO NOT TAKE HER!
Harsh grader, rude and condescending. My best friend is an accountant and I've shown him some of her grading and it's a complete joke. She doesnt know how to treat people professionally. She calls students out for mistakes in front of 100 people and if you email her she gives you vague answers and accuses you of not studying. Only passing bc of TA
Hylton knows her stuff, but she's not a good professor at all. Honestly, TA's are the reason I passed this class. She's condescending and makes the class an uncomfortable environment to ask questions. Take advantage of recitation/tutoring hours if you want to do well. She'll make you question Acct as a major.. just a dreadful experience.
Tough professor, does not go into detail on material, if you take her plan on learning the calculations yourself.
Hylton does not go in depth during her lectures. This makes it difficult to understand the harder questions that appear on her test. Does NOT give straight answers at all. Good luck busting your ass to anyone else that has to take her class
Terrible professor. Does not help you at all. She's evil and she knows it. DO NOT TAKE HER.
Avoid her at all cost. Taking this class made my entire semester miserable. She wants you to study for her class and her class only. Got As and Bs in rest of my classes but got a C in her with twice more effort and studying time. Puts questions on test which she never went over. Worst professor I ever had and ever will have.
This class is one of the easiest class in my life. I didn't study at all and got a perfect on the exam. Homework problems help prepare you well for the exams. If you can do those without looking things up you should have an easy A. Also she is Hilarious and not afraid to call people out.
I do recommend her if you are an accounting major, take no other classes and have no personal life. Again, if you are in college to be an accountant, great, you will be a good one. But if you are not, the amount of work is excessive, the teaching method is outdated and ineffective, tests are badly designed. Again, she is only for accounting majors.
I had to take Constance for Accounting 203. I studied constantly and used the resources given to me, however I still was not able to score well on her tests. If you go to her for help she does give you very vague answers. I think she forgets we are just starting out in the beginner levels.
The worst educator I have ever had. Do NOT take this professor unless you enjoy repeating courses.
poor teaching
Professor Hylton has probably been my least favorite professor I have had while I have been at GMU. When I asked her for help, she would completely ignore me and would tell me to look it up for myself. I would not recommend. Beware of the second test.
Constance is a very tough grader when it comes to her 492 class. I don't understand where her grading comes from since it is not clear. Don't argue with her if you want a good grade. You don't know your grade until grades are posted on patriotweb so that sucks!!! If you can stick with her bs then you should be fine. She is very difficult to work w.
Read chap prior to each class so that you're not learning material for the 1st time w her. Lectures are more of a review rather than an in depth explanation. Do not expect to gain much understanding til recitation/tutor hours. Tons of resources like ORION in wileyplus USE THEM! 2nd &amp; 3rd exams are ridiculously difficult, do all exercises/quizzes
Teacher name: Singer, Harvey
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Not the best or the worst, just an average professor. He gets a little annoyed when you ask him questions during class, but otherwise his tests are not that bad and he provides samples beforehand so you get a strong idea of what you'll be tested on.
He is VERY RUDE. Entire semester he was rude to multiple students when it came time for teacher evaluations he wanted to act "nice" as if we forget how rude he was the entire semester. He's condescending &amp; very disrespectful. You're a teacher your job is to teach not be rude &amp; talk down to those who ask for clarification.
Horrible professor he is rude to students and talks down to everyone. He is not helpful what so ever &amp; is very condescending. Take another prof.
Horrible teacher, would not recommend to any living human being. I believe in Donald Trump more than i believe in this moron. Lectures arent worth a mcchicken. His references remind you of Kanyes drunk tweets.
Horrible Professor. Lectures are absolutely useless and bland like a sandwich with no sauce. Covers material over the course of 3 hours that takes 5 minutes. Do not take this professor. Babbles on about irrelevant examples and his encounters which don't apply to the class.
Best professor I've ever had!
He's you average college professor. As someone mentioned earlier, you can either like him or hate him. LONG power points (over 80 slides) FILLED with information. Attended every class but still couldn't figure out which info was important vs. which wasn't. Really boring subject, tries to make it fun by cracking a few jokes (not all are funny).
This class is very easy to pass. Attendance isnt required however, he does have quizzes that he "announces" but you need to be in class to hear that announcement. Exams and quizzes are easy and he makes the topic and course enjoyable for the 3 hour lecture.
I highly enjoyed his course. The slideshows are long but just take notes on the key points and it'll cover what you need to know. Exams have problems like the homework, do those and you'll be fine. He gives you the formulas so if you did the hw at all, you'll remember how it works. Great guy who cares about the students and has a sense of humor too
Singer is a fine professor, but I just found the OM course to be very dry and boring. Very definition-oriented. Read through the PPTs and practice problems in the textbook and you should do fine, but I'm just glad I'm not an OM major.
You will either love Harvey, or you will hate him. Theres no middle ground. I loved him, however. Very caring guy, and a very dry and sharp sense of humor. This class is straight forward, just make sure you attend EVERY class after the midterm as there are pop quizzes almost every class. Also, check blackboard every week as he hides announcements
Not a bad class but long lectures. Tests are off PP slides (a lot) and text book examples he does in class so it helps to be there, he also gives credit for attendance.
Terrible! Exams based on his PP which contains 200 slides and you have to read the textbook too. Slides poorly written. Talks to hear himself, gives little explanation on the exercises, poor lectures but exams are made hard and trick (with surprise questions). Quizzes are completed by himself in class, not by students so they get "free" credits.
Harvey's lectures are enjoyable to listen to, even if the content is boring. Gives little homework, one 10-questioner per chapter, and its all online that you gotta buy access to. Lenient grader, some trick questions in his exams but otherwise easy to get at least an A- on em.
He talks the whole class time, most of the time he's off topic. The lecture powerpoints have like 100 slides each so it's a lot of reading. Didn't need the textbook. Need to study for tests but he curves them pretty nicely. Says there are pop quizzes but announces them before hand.
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! He is the worst! Every topic he discuss in class has over 80 power point slides, and he is expect you to also study the textbook on topic of his slides. His exams are so long and it's not enough time to finish to check them. everything is very confusing. it's not supposed to be a hard class but he make very difficulty
He's very rude to students. One time I went to him during his office hours, and he was very rude to me and made me feel very bad that I was asking for help. His teaching abilities aren't great, and he's also extremely boring.
He's good.
I do not understand how anyone can give him a bad review. He is a great professor, very passionate about what he does and wants everyone to pass. If you are respectful and show up to class on time each day like you are supposed to, there is no reason why you should fail. I did not study too hard for the 3 exams and I received A's and a B on them
I expected the worst from these reviews but I really liked him. Everything is pretty organized and you know what to study. Study off the PPT, do the homework, practice the problems a few times and you can get an A. I recommend showing up 'cause he explains the problems and may give pop quizzes where only the people in attendance can get an A.
Teacher name: Fondufe, Gwen
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
I recommend if you actually want to do well and know the material do NOT take this professor. This is a heavy do it yourself type of class and no homework just heavy lectures/exams.
Rambling excessive talking makes understanding simple concepts difficult. Constantly behind her teaching schedule so we are left to teach stuff on our own for tests. tests are exceptionally difficult and her powerpoints do not prepare you for them. You might as well teach yourself the information. Definitely do not take her.
Reads off the slides a lot of times and she does not explain well.
Not good
Horrible. Can't teach at all and reads directly off the slides. Don't be fooled by others that she's easier than other professors. She's the most difficult.
The slides and textbook for this class are pretty dry, but Dr Fondufe is so animated and passionate that she makes it (at least fairly) interesting. Very nice and caring, definitely recommend to get through upper level bio classes.
She's amazing. Take her!! Her exams are easy because she gives study guides that are really similar to the tests. She also posts her powerpoints that are word for word just like the textbook, so don't bother buying it. She makes her lectures fun and tolerable, and she's really easy going. Take her if you are given the chance!
Such a sweetheart. All lectures are read directly off the powerpoint, so attendance is not mandatory. YOU HAVE TO STUDY. Study guides are incredibly long but success in the class is based entirely on how well you know test content.
She is definitely passionate about biology as you can tell by her lectures. The homework on Sapling is very easy to get an A on and she gives you plenty of time to complete them. Her exams are based off of her powerpoints so attendance isn't mandatory. She will answer any questions you may have during the lecture.
Mason is blessed to have Dr. Fondufe. She is so knowledgeable and passionate about bio. She will provide students with amazing notes and study guides. Replies to email within few hours. She has respect for all her students. Just make sure to study the powerpoint notes and you will ace her exam. I would take her again.
Dr. Fondufe is an amazing professor. Bio is hard. You get what you put it. She will provide you with amazing notes. Dont even bother buying the textbook. Everything is from the PowerPoint. She will always give 1-3 points as a curve and extra credit on every test. Everything on final is from old tests. She is caring and always have a +ve attitude.
Fondufe has a slight accent but its still very easy to understand her. The lectures were really interesting and she sometimes included questions from the exam on the slides. She also has additional online homework that will help you learn the material.
This class was a 100 level class. I was shocked by how much work and effort I had to put into this class. I spent a lot of time studying for this class. There are four exams and all are pretty tough. If you are not a biology major I would recommend not to take her. Overall, I struggled in this class.
She's a great person and is obviously very passionate about biology. The class is very lecture heavy so if you don't enjoy being talked at for two hours straight lecture can be a struggle to get the motivation to go to. Should do fine on tests if you're able to memorize the powerpoints also, take advantage of the LA review sessions!
She is such a lovable woman and so easy to talk to if you have a question after class or during her office hours. Exams are so easy if you just study the lecture slides, I would recommend saving money and not getting the textbook for the class because you won't need it at all if you just study the lecture slides a lot.
She was an amazing teacher. You have to sit through 2 of her talking about interesting topics! I loved the classes.
Professor Fondufe is an amazing instructor. She knows her stuff inside and out and genuinely enjoys teaching biology. You have to know her powerpoints for the exams, but if you come to class and go over them once or twice, you can easily Ace her class.
No need to buy a textbook, exams are based off her PowerPoints and all assessments are on the syllabus. Lectures are fun, she has such a personality!
Prof Fondufe is an amazing teacher and person. If you have any questions at all, she is more than happy to answer them outside of class. Bio 213 is very lecture heavy, so if you cant memorize you obviously won't do so hot, but if you can its an easy A.
Basically just reads off the powerpoint slides. Don't take her if you like being talked at for 2 hours. The exam questions are right off the powerpoint. Make sure you know the "flow" of everything and how everything fits together. Going to class is useful, only if you pay attention. Don't go if you zone out or are not willing to put in the effort
Teacher name: Kocache, Malda
School name: George Mason University

Teacher comments: 
She is very knowledgeable on the subject and tries to make it as fun as she can. This is a very hard class though, it contains a lot of material. You must go to every lecture and study a large amount!!
Amazing, hilarious teacher! Absolutely loved her and the class, just be prepared to really pay attention to her lectures and study for the midterm/final.
very funny and informative lectures. If you show up to class and focus on what she says you should be fine. Final is not cumulative
by far the best professor I have had at gmu. extremely passionate about the subject, does a fabulous job at teaching the material. yes this is a 400 level class so it is difficult but if you show up to class and listen to her lecture/read the powerpoint notes youll end up with an A. Also do the hw makes difference by letter grade
Dr. Kocache is my favorite professor by far at Mason. She's really entertaining and really gets into the material. Its amazing when you have a professor who is as passionate about a topic as you are. She's very knowledgeable and explains things well in an easy to understand way.
Highly recommend Dr. K to anyone who is on the pre-med/dental/health track. Yes this class is hard bc its a 400 level course but its worth it. 3 noncumulative exams (exam 3 is the final), 3 short summaries, 7 case study hw , 1 group presentation. No book req. just study the PowerPoints &amp; show up to class you'll do fine! :)
Dr Kocache is an amazing professor and I would defiantly take her again. 2 article reviews. 1 midterm and a final( not cumulative) and one case study presentation. I usually hate presenting in class but it was not hard at all. It is a 400 Biology class so it's not easy. But if you study , you will pass with an A.
Such a fun class. Really gotta use the powerpoints to study for her tests. Make sure you really know the material before tests because she tends to ask trick questions on her tests! Pop quizzes are easy, just make sure you are listening during her lectures! It's not hard to stay focused during her lectures because she is freakin' hilarious.
Dr. Kocache is phenomenal. She is passionate, entertaining, and a true expert in the subject area. There was never a dull moment in the course. Be prepared to study your butt off if you want that A because her exams are difficult, especially Exam 1. Provides great feedback on how to improve. You have to start studying ahead of time and go to class!
The best teacher I ever had. She really knows how to teach; her lectures were engaging, funny, and helped you remember with stories. The class is hard because you have to memorize a lot, but only the info she teaches in class. Never used the textbook. Print the Power Points to write on, record the lectures, and study what she teaches in class.
Dr. Kocache is an amazing professor. She is very passionate about what she teaches and is very good at her job. She is great at explaining the material and very funny. Although, the material is VERY hard. Incoming nursing majors you have been warned. Go to every lecture and pay attention the entire time, study a LOT, and you will be fine.
She's the best teacher I ever had! Very funny, caring, and a great teacher all around. The material can be challenging, but she does her best to help you in any way she can.
Dr. Kocache is a great teacher! She makes all the lectures engaging and interactive. She makes sure that you truly learn and understand the material completely. Her powerpoints are detailed and good to study from. She also is always available by email or office hours. She is great at helping one on one and giving good tips for studying.
Professor Kocache is absolutely amazing. She loves what she teaches and constantly gives you fun stories to help remember  material. She is straight forward with what is expected. Does NOT give out any minuses, ex. C-. You have to stay on top of the material or else you won't do well. Thankfully, she makes it fun! I wish I could take her again.
I took Dr. Kocache's class this spring and she is AMAZING. By far the best Professor at Mason and I am actually sad that her class is over. She's passionate, enthusiastic, and wants her students to succeed. She taught me so much this semester and she has absolutely made an impact on my education for certain. All teachers should be like Dr. Kocache!
Omg Kocache is the best. Her lectures are the best. Her test is heavy on ppt. She will not test on things she won't go over so really going to class and taking notes on her slides is helpful. My lowest test score was a 89, and she dropped one test so I had an A in all my other tests. Again key to pass is to show up and take notes and do the HW.
Dr. Kocache is a fantastic professor and just genuinely a really great person. Her lectures were never dull and she really engages students throughout the class in discussion. Exams were MC and homework assignments were helpful to use as study guides for tests. Kindest professor I've ever had. Take her class if you have the opportunity!
Make your own study guides along with her own, record lectures, get a group of classmates to exchange, take notes, understand material, ask for help if you need it, write notes when you get home, do well on homework and quizzes to increase your grade if a test is bad
She is a great professor. She knows her information. However,  her exams are quite difficult and tricky. This is not an easy course. But she is a fun professor. Go to class, go to office hours because every grade matters in this course.
Introduction to Microbiology was a really good experience with Dr. Kokache. However, some of the questions of the tests were tricky. However, she was fantastic at explaining important concepts of microbiology even though some of the concepts were complicated. I would definitely recommend this professor to other students as she is awesome.
Teacher name: Orens, John
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Orens is a traditional and competent professor. Each class is a spoken lecture assisted by a topical outline projected to the board. His lectures are clear and insightful; he keeps the content as interesting as possible. He does not allow technology in class. There are several multiple choice quizzes and two "papers" (collections of short answers).
Prof. Orens' lectures and storytelling skills made this class interesting - you can tell he is genuinely passionate about history. He provides review guides for all the quizzes which is very helpful. For the midterm and final, you are required to write a paper (it's graded hard, but if you put effort in and follow his guidelines, you'll pass) 10/10
Professor Orens is caring and wants his students to do well. The 4 quizzes were easy. The midterm/final papers were difficult but still doable. There is a lot of extra credit offered at the end (really worth raising your grade)! If you're not strong in writing nor enjoy history, don't take this class. This isn't a class you can slack off in.
He lectures the whole class, but he talks in an engaging way. His history class was the first history class I've ever enjoyed. He has a few quizzes, but if you study the review sheet, and understand it, you should be fine. The midterm/final are essays and straight forward so just stick to the rules he gives (very specific rules) or you lose marks.
Great guy, very nice and understanding. His lectures can be really dry and you have to take notes off of his talking points. Quizzes are easy as long as you study for them and papers are graded VERY HARSHLY. When I went to talk with his TA about my paper, she ripped me apart and accused me of not using the textbook. Kinda felt insulted by that.
Your only grades are a few quizzes and 1 or 2 papers. The lectures are basically all you need to complete those, so you HAVE to go to class. He does lectures weird though, no powerpoints. He just writes topics on the board and talks about them so you have to write as he talks.
The best teacher one can have, very understanding, very lenient, and very respected. I never liked history but he made me love it. His tests are very nicely graded. The class is an easy A if you right down every word that leaves his mouth. All the tests given will have sample questions from which they will be tested.
You can tell loves the subject and teaching. The downsides are that he doesn't use blackboard so you either ask him in office hours what your grade is, or calculate it yourself. He is strict on grading but he tells you what he wants. there are 5 quizzes which he basically tells you the questions before, and 2 essays that have extra credit (DO IT)
There are about 5 quizzes throughout the semester, BUT the final and midterm are papers. The only thing is he does not use Blackboard so you do not know your grade unless you show up at his office hours. The final and midterm have ALOT of rules, if you take him make sure you do the final and the midterm the way that he wants you to do it.
This guy would put me to sleep every class, the study guide is pretty similar to the quizzes but not exact. They grade harshly on the essays for no reason acting like its an advanced history class...
Dr. Orens is a good professor. Hes very engaging and truly cares about the subject. However, the essays are insane. I got an A on all of my quizzes but a 77% on my essay. I was deducted 23% only because of formatting. Its ridiculous. The essays arent difficult. Theyre just really picky on how they want it to look like.
Prof. Orens is a nice man and he lectures very well. However, if you're not interested in history, it may be a boring course for you. There are four quizzes that he sends out review guides for and there are two major papers--the midterm and the final. The class overall is not hard but make sure to go to class.
He is one of my absolute favorite professors. He keeps everyone engaged during his lectures and story telling. His quizzes are ver easy if you do the review guide. He doesn't tolerate phones, laptops, or talking in his class but I feel that this is helpful for keeping me focused. I would love to take another class with him and recommend his class.
Orens is pretty good, but for his midterm and final he gives papers instead of exams so if youre not into writing, then I wouldnt recommend him cuz hes really strict when grading them
Good professor, engaging. But when it comes to grading papers........ they are very tough and grades very harshly. Honestly don't know why. It's only a 100 level class not 400 level. Gives study guides for quizzes (4 in total). I would not recommend taking him ONLY because of the 2 major essay. Grading is ridiculous! BE AWARE AND TAKE SOMEONE ELSE.
Best professor I've had at Mason so far. He is really nice and passionate about history. Doesn't take attendance, but go because that's where you'll get your notes. Strict about use of electronics, but it keeps you engaged. Gives 4 quizzes, but he gives study guides with all the questions on it. Doesn't give mid-term or final tests, only papers.
The guy's very passionate about history. It's just western civilization so of course I don't really need to go as its stuff we already learned, but I still do, because the guy obviously knows what he's talking about and he loves what he does.
He is really nice and funny. Attendance isn't mandatory but go because that is where you will get your notes. He doesn't use blackboard so everything is turn in class. you only have 2 papers but you have 2 weeks to do them, and they are easy. Test are multiple choice 35 questions. give study guides. NO ELECTRONICS IN CLASS! Easy class. Take him.
Good professor, his lectures are entertaining and he is very enthusiastic about what he is teaching. You aren't allowed computers nor phones in class, which he is very serious about. But besides that, it's a good class to take! He gives you study guides for the quizzes, and they're very helpful. Do the work and you'll be fine!
He was by far my favorite teacher at Mason. I came prepared to hate History but it ended up being the best subject. Though attending class is not compulsory, I recommend showing up and taking notes because the tests are based on his lectures and primary sources. His lectures taught me so much about life and were very deep. His TA's are very helpful

Teacher comments: 
Don is a great Prof. I would take again. You dont need to do the readings if you show up to class. Very clear, and entertaining speaker.
Great Prof easy class three exams funny guy 30 multiple choice.
Not only is he a very kind human being with a clear passion for his subject, but he's also a great lecturer. I won't lie, the class was pretty dry sometimes due to the nature of the material, but he made it more interesting. Grades consisted of 3 exams. Go to class, that's where all his questions come from. I would 100% take a class with him again.
He is the best econ teacher at Mason, he only tests u on what he talks about in class. The book is not necessary. makes econ easy to understand. i would recommend to record the class, take good notes and get a study group for suree. i would take him again no boubt. he doesnt use blackboard. if u are struggling, talk to him!
Prof. Boudreaux is masterful in economics. His lectures are very informative and he's extremely intelligent. In order to do well in this class, you need to attend every class, take good notes, and understand the concepts. His class consists of two tests and a final. Tests can be tricky and wording can be tough, but if you study, you'll be fine.
Amazing lecturer! you never get bored in class! Final grade consists of midterm, paper, and final. If you will be absent for a class, make sure you can get notes from another classmates. He really knows what he's doing and I would take him again.
exams are mostly on applying concepts in the lectures and are multiple-choice. i dozed off a lot in the class until the very end where it got a little interesting. i recommend taking notes and recording his lectures since his main topics are outlined in his head, but he speaks in an unorganized manner about them. luckily he gives a lot of examples.
Was nervous about econ- took this course over the summer, best choice I ever made. I highly recommend Boudreaux. Lectures are easy to comprehend. Recording lectures will help tremendously! Write good notes and review them if you want an A which shouldn't be too hard. He provides no notes/pwrpt. Only graded on 3 exams, txtbook not required!!
The class has 3 exams; exam 1, exam 2, and final. All of them come straight from lecture but you have to know the lectures really well/in detail. He does give curves and the exams are okay. Textbook was pointless to buy and he tells you to not buy it. Only thing I didn't like was that he does not give any assignments to help with your grade.
His class is based on 2 exams and the final. Just show up to class and take good notes and form study groups and you should pass the class with no problem. His lectures are very interesting and quite stimulating.
He is truly the best Econ professor at Mason. It's all about listening and note-taking when comes to a high institution. He doesn't use blackboard or give out homework, however, he does repeat the concept quite a few times and provides great examples. The exams were decent and the key to pass this class is to take good notes and form study groups!
your grade depends on 2 midterm and the final. I did bad in the class because i got a C on my second exam cause i was sick. this professor is really good and passionate about econ. the final was hard for me
He is not that grade. If you hate econ then you will hate his class. grades were based off three hard exams. Show up and listen and take notes and u will do okay but it is soooo boring. only econ and finance people like him
Maybe the best professor I have ever had. This class was intellectually stimulating and extremely useful. He's a terrific lecturer and if you show up, listen, and take notes, there is no reason not to get an A. Anyone who doesn't like him obviously did not attend class regularly. This class will give you a much better understanding of the world.
Professor Boudreaux is fantastic. Considering that he is one of the top economists in the world he is very down to earth. He is always willing to help and talk to students. If you disagree, let him know. He's very open to discussions. Really enjoyed this class.
One of the most useful classes I ever taken. Show up to class, pay attention very careful and you will get an easy A.
He does make a 3 hour lecture very interesting and go by quickly. However, his teaching style made the class difficult. Not sure if its his strategy or just laziness. The only grades are 2 exams and the final. He will test you on anything he lectured on and doesnt have slides, notes, or any sort of study guide.
Boudreaux is the BEST professor at Mason. If you have the chance to take him do it! He makes economics interesting and funny. Hes got loads of stories that all correlate to what he lectures on and does a great job relaying it to the class. He know what hes talking about and if you just show up, take good notes, and listen youll pass easily.
It's hard to get a good grade in this class because your entire grade is just two tests and a final. If you don't do well on one, your basically screwed for the rest. I'd only recommend this class if you are a good test taker and don't want to do any outside work besides studying lecture notes (b/c that's what his tests are based on).
Only graded on 2 exams and a final. Doesn't use blackboard and takes forever to respond to emails. Don't miss lecture or you won't pass, so make sure to take great notes cause that's the only thing you can refer back to study for exams. Textbook was a waste of money in fact he wrote in his syllabus to follow what he says in his lectures.
Teacher name: Bennett, James
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
James Bennett never used the textbook for the class. The online homework was made intentionally difficult. The exams for the class werent based on the practice exams. Professor doesnt use blackboard.
Dr James Bennett intentionally made this class hard because the exams were so difficult and not based on lectures, homework, and practice exam. He deliberately makes students fail
Didn't go to a single class and still got an A, the textbook is your best friend. Tests heavily based around textbook teachings. If you feel bad about an exam you can 'DNR' but that puts more weight on the final. Do not do this. Just be sure to read up and do well on alpia homework and you'll be good. Read for the time you'r skipping class. Trust
Much easier than the other option of restisi if you have the option of bennett take him he is the easiest econ professor but still not that easy.
This guy is great. Very funny. If you actually show up to class and listen and do the work you'll be fine. He literally tell you what is important and what will be one the exam and he tells you things to help you remember the concepts. I don't ike economics but this professor made it enjoyable.
He is a very rude professor ever. You could not communicate with him even the 1st time. He doesn't respect the students at all
Worst class ever. He tells you at the beginning of the semester that his class is the most failed course in the entire university but I was naive and stayed in his class. Big mistake. All he does is talk talk talk and derails himself from what he's teaching to personal stories and he doesn't go in depth, the exams were a nightmare.
His lectures are vague, but makes understanding the material easier, but don't depend on your in-class notes to help you pass the exams. Reading the textbook made this class easy for me and also take advantage of the sample exams he posts on blackboard and the ungraded HW problems. This is an easy class to pass as long as you put the effort in.
Funny guy, hard tests. His lectures are vague compared to the tests.
Economics is already a really boring subject, and though he's very nice, the class was definitely TRASH. I struggled following along and the homework or reading didn't help me at all. Maybe I'm just dumb but..... wouldn't recommend.
It's easy to follow along with his lectures if you read the chapter the night before. You will be lost if you don't. Skipping class will affect you the most since there are times where the lecture made more sense than the textbook. if your lazy and you fall behind by one chapter it is over for you. Good Luck playing catch up from then on.
Do not take!
Do not take!This man is so disrespectful, when handing back our exams, He threw them on the ground so we could come pick them up like dogs. Once during a test I asked a question, he came up straight in my face and told me I didn't know cause I don't pay attention. turns out everyone had the same question. I reported him, and the school did NOTHING
Most savvy prof ever. Relates everything to economics. Wants to prepare students to succeed in REAL WORLD. Tough grader who teaches by showing where wrong. Short paper every week to improve analytical and writing skills. Course is unforgettable.
Lots of thinking; not much reading. Class stresses how to use basic econ to solve problems and business writing. Seminar format. No exams. Bennett marks up we short weekly papers to improve writing skills. You will learn a lot. Don't miss class, discussion is always interesting.... different from other courses. Prof's TA grades the papers.
Where do I begin with this professor? To flourish in the class, you have to DROP YOUR EGO bc he is not afraid to tell it like it is. Get ready to get low grades on your paper. By low grades I mean 4/10 one week, 5/10 another week. Maybe 6/10 the next week. But once u get thru the trails/ tribulations , you will love the course for he is brilliant.
Bennett attempts to dismantle the typical undergraduate learning environment by running his class like a symposium. While there is a range of appropriate answers for each weekly prompt, the structure allows you think both economically and logically. Students who have a clear understanding of economic concepts are rewarded.
Hard Grader Worth it. No other course is like this one. Teacher explains how to analyze problems using simple economics. Sort of off the wall, but interesting classes. Sometimes stuff discusses seems weird, but it makes sense in the end. He marked up my papers more than any english prof. Useful course.
Never had a class like this.... Never know what will be discussed in class. Could be opera, ancient China, recycling, ducks, or most anything -- but it WORKS. It's entertaining, interesting, and I leave each class with new info/ideas. Sometimes seems crazy, but there is a method.
Dr. Bennett is a true asset to GMU. His main goal is to teach you to think critically in life and become successful. This class is not for the faint of heart, several people couldn't hack it. If you manage to make it to the end of the course, you will learn a lot about yourself and the challenges employers will give you.

Teacher comments: 
Easy A. Four exams for your grade. All open note and most are take home. Lectures are a little bland and some questions on the exams aren't in the book or slides. It is open note though so they are still very easy. Would recommend. Easy A.
He is so sweet and truly cares about his students! He doesn't believe in traditional memorization so he allows open note exams (hint, use his powerpoints from class and skim the textbook beforehand so you know where everything is in the chapters). 100% recommend!!
Literally this is an EASY A!!! I did not show up most of the class, just read the book and his power-point.
This class was almost too easy for me. He is a nice professor and talks alot but its good. The exams were open book but may not always be that way. Everything is in the textbook or online too. The last two were take home exams which makes it even easier. Maybe the class can be more challenging but people will still not care so everyone is happy.
Class is only open book classes. Sometimes the questions on the test werent in the book but overall it was a v easy class. He spends most of his lectures humblebragging
The grade comes from 4 open note tests. Usually there are a couple of questions on the test about his lectures, but everything else you can learn from reading the book. There's also an option to do an extra credit paper, you just can't use it to get from an A to an A+. He's very friendly and likes to tell jokes, he'll also talk about careers.
this guy is awesome! he gave 4 tests that were super easy--literally just questions from the study guide-- and most of the time they were take-home. he really listens to what the students want and cares for them on top of being HILARIOUS. love love love him!!!!
Prof. Shiraev is very knowledgeable and has first-hand experiences to share with the class. He is one of the authors of the textbook that is used and slides are available on blackboard; there are minor differences between what is shown in class. He's a bit too pro-Russia for me that is in conflict with my previous learning and work contexts.
Very nice guy. Everything is in the textbook, you just have to find it. The tests are open book and easy, you just need to have the review done and you'll be able to get a good grade on the tests.
Great professor, Russian accent is easy to understand. Very smart, funny, caring. He offers a global view and has lots of jokes and practical examples. Works with you,offers an extra credit paper. Read book (he wrote it) and take notes for open book exams. You need to go to class, he has class examples that aren't in the book. Class is fun! Go!
JUST TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN AWESOME PROFESSOR TESTS ARE TAKE HOME AND HES JUST SO SWEET AND CARING! BEST PROFESSOR FROM MY FOUR YEARS IN MASON
If you have the chance to take any class by Professor Shiraev do it. Open book exams and there isn't attendance taken. There is also an extra credit paper worth 5%. If you get anything less than a B in this class then you really shouldn't be in school, plus the syllabus is clear and concise
People will tell you all his classes are open book - proceed with caution b/c you could be in the ONE class he has a semester that isn't. Other than that, he's a good prof but will spend WAY too much time on some things rather than others. You can get away with skipping class if you read the textbook - it's written by him so it's 100% same material
This past semester he didn't do the open note tests like he had before. The class is kind of boring but he's nice. He does give study guides that include 90% of what is on the tests but sometimes the test will include very specific #s (ex. 72% of population, 4.3 million people, etc.) that are nearly impossible to get.
His class is very fair. Read the book and do the study guide and you should do well. Extra credit is great
Dr. Shiraev is a phenomenal professor. His class for IR Theory is made up of 4 tests, non-cumulative and 1 term paper that varies between 2200 to 3000 words. His tests are open book, open note, and you can have your laptop out at the same time. So needless to say you can get an A no problem. Dr. Shiraev himself is very wise, so please take him!
I was expecting an easy A out of this class, but for me it wasn't an easy. I don't know if it was because of his teaching style that I struggled with this class or because I didn't understand the material. You don't really have to go to class. His study guides are so long and tests on the minor details. Only the last test was open note.
He is the BEST !!!!!!
Professor Shiraev is so knowledgeable and respected in his field. However, his lecture style was really hard for me to follow and his tests focused on tiny details instead of important concepts and facts. The final was open note and that made all the difference.
TAKE THIS CLASS!! He is a very nice person. The textbook is written by him so you don't even need to show up. easy A
Teacher name: Schreifels, Joh
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Great guy, horrible professor. Do not take him if given the chance. His grading criteria is confusing and you don't know if you're going to pass until the final is put in because of the way he weighs everything. Worst prof ever.
Dr. Schreifels is really a great professor, very caring and genuine. He wants you to pass with the grade you desire but you need to earn it. Watch his online lectures outside of class and be prepared to do problems in class. He does I-clickers almost every class. The key is to stay ahead and youll be fine! Im so sad hes not teaching Chem212!!
He would assign videos to watch outside of class and in class time was for practice problems. First day he has everyone write their name on notecards and he draws names at random to answer questions on the board for credit and there's also iclicker quizzes so I would show up to class. He's a fine dude but not my preferred way of learning.
You definitely have to prepare outside of class if you want to pass. If you don't watch the videos before class, you'll just end up confused the entire time. Put in the work, or you wont pass. Don't bother emailing the professor because he never emails back. Show up to class because he will give you mini quizzes every class.
I attempted to receive help from him directly by emailing him and going to his office hours. This is not recommended. However, It's highly recommended to receive help on homework and practice exams from the tutoring center sooner rather than later. Attending the classes and review sessions helped significantly to learn the concepts. Good luck!
Honestly, he is such a kind soul who truly cares about his students. You can definitely tell he has a passion to teach. Just be sure to watch videos and try to get 100 on all homework. Put in the work, it's not that hard. I wish he was teaching orgo :(
Prof Schreifels was definitely not the professor for me. If you're more of an independent learner, for sure take Prof Schreifels. He posts lectures online and you're expected to know the material by next class. He uses class time for iClicker quizzes and if you don't know the material, you're kind of screwed. The TA's aren't much help either.
Awesome chem prof. Gives lecture videos as hw but mainly gives practice ?'s in class which is SUPER HELPFUL, especially for hw &amp; tests. Make sure to take careful notes! Iclickers every class. Really wants you to understand the concept and be able to solve different types of ?'s. Super caring &amp; always willing to help.
Kindest professor I know. I can't believe the amount of altruism he exerts. Always willing to help and has been teaching chem for years. Put in the effort, go to office hours, do your homework (use it to also review before test) and you will be fine. A few in class quizzes and problems. Took him over the summer.
Really nice guy, you just have to put in the work. He is more than willingly to help, and the he conducts his class just has to be your style.
doesn't lecture, makes u watch videos at home and just quizzes on the material (and sometimes things that weren't reviewed in the videos). several iclicker quizzes almost every class
"I can be your dad" is one of the ways he tells his students that he's there for you. Basically professor Rick from Rick and Morty, but in real life. If you ever want a good story you can hang out with him in his office anytime.
Nice and is willing to help and answer questions.
Chill
Had him for summer 2003 with Roberts Weatherspoon as the lab teacher. What a team, an incompetent lecture teacher and a RUDE lab professor. He doesn't even know how to grade, he says he curves yet he made a 70 percent which is a "C" in standard grading a C-!! What kind of curve is this?!
Chemistry is obviously his area of expertise, he is a man of genius. However, I do not feel that part of that expertise is being a professor for a Gen Ed course. He is very quiet, gave us assigned seats that kept switching, and his 4 exams used vocabulary that the 19+ homeworks didn't use. W/o the exams I had a high B, but I failed all the exams.
NOT TOO MUCH LECTURE IN CLASS!!!u have to watch his lecture videos to study the material before classes, so that he goes through practicing questions on the classes. For the course: IF U GOT HW &amp; PRACTICE DONE PERFECTLY, THEN U ARE FINE. u practice with the questions that u 'll have on exam. Final has its own question, but u can deal with it.
He's good professor but you have to do the work and have prior knowledge to get an A. Make sure you do/take notes of videos before lecture and complete hw. Ive heard people did well on exams when they went to review sessions/prac online exams. In class you do lot of 'group' probs and iclicker with little lecturing. Keep up wwork and ull do fine!
I'm not a chem wiz but Schreifels isn't as bad as people make him out to be. The key is to stay ahead. most people get confused because they fall behind. As far as exams, redo the prac. problems over and over until you memorize them (get an A if you do). Watch YouTube videos. Yes you will have to be practice a lot own your own but that's college
Basically his exam questions come straight from the online practice exams which makes it super easy to get a good grade on the exams. BUT this does not prepare you whats so ever for the ACS final and the lab also drops your grade. In the end he does a bell curve so like the last post do not expect a curve if you got a C, only for Ds or Bs.
Teacher name: Demory, Yvonne
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
She's a lawyer teaching Business Law, so she knows what she's talking about. Her tests are pretty easy if you paid attention during lectures, but she's a tough grader on the in-class essays and really makes you work for an A. Overall, she's a good choice.
Professor Demory is a great professor, yes, you have to work for your grade but she doesn't over complicate your life or make it hard in any way. Her grading criteria is very clear, and she is very compassionate - especially towards the end of the semester. The one thing I recommend is to THOROUGHLY read the textbook chapters :)
(4) Final essay is cumulative. Out of 56 cases from all semester she picks a random one for the final. So you have to study all 56 cases and the laws that apply to each and then she chooses one. Waste of time. Only 30 minutes to do the final. So in those 30 minutes to have to figure out which ONE out of the 56 case applies and write the essay.
(3) The text book really isn't necessary. You really only need to listen to her audio lectures and look up the cases if you feel like you didn't get enough info from the audio lecture. Movie assignments (3)25 points, essays (6) 100 points, final essay (200). 2 lowest essays are dropped. You only have Friday afternoon and Saturday morning to do it
(2) Not flexible at all despite being an online class. She is a very tough grader, the only thing I liked was that she did grade everything on time and was well organized. She gives a rubric for the essays but shows a completely different rubric once she gives back the grades. Sometimes came off as rude in her comments and passive aggressive.
A great professor who can seem intimidating at first but is a gem. She lets you drop one low test score out of five tests. You NEED to read the textbook and her slides inside and out and take notes in order to pass (take notes before she goes over it in class). Not a hard class if you study your notes. She tells you what is expected on exams.
I took her online class and she is well organized and you know what is due by when by schedule every week. lectures are available online. But the only thing I did not like about her is that she is a very tough grader on essays. It was stressful moment when I had to write the essay each week in only 30 min.
I took BULE 303 online with her and she was great. The class was so easy. Exams were open notes (since they were online) and you're allowed to have a whole page of notes for the essays. Super easy class and she's wonderful.
Took her online BULE 303 class and let me tell you she's the biggest hardo possible. She gives you NO TYPE OF HELP. Refrain from taking her class, she isnt worth the headache!! You'll have a good reasoning why you need help or even why you need extra time on assignment and she wont budge. She honestly is so heartless its absurd.
I took her online BULE303 class for the summer 2018 and boy did I work. You have to work a little everyday to make sure you keep up. Also pay close attention to all the cases they talk about in the chapters she asks you to read. Make little notes about what happened in the case/outcome. The essays are the WORST so prepare well.
If you want a professor who makes you do all the work, refuses to communicate and help you, and will accuse you of plagiarism or cheating when you make a mistake, this is the professor you want. She is not an educator, she is someone collecting a paycheck who does not care about their students. If you like to feel unappreciated, take this prof.
She is nice, no doubt about that. Seems like a good teacher. But. She is confusing. Her grading is confusing. One assignment you'll get full points (even if you didn't completely follow the prompt), the next (when you do everything correctly) she fails you. I do not understand her. I'm wasting my time taking this class. Don't waste yours.
A lot of homework, does not gives you another chance, doesn't understand your needs, take another professor, writing essays are so annoying! choose another professor.
Take it ONLINE! Follow the instruction, do all the hw, quizzes, lower grade is dropped. Read and keep up with due dates. Mention cases when writing. You will do good and pass if you follow the syllabus and turn in hw, I promise you will pass successfully! The hardest part was the on-campus essays exams and it was not that bad either
BULE 303 is supposed to be one of the hardest classes and she managed to make it seem not as hard. There is alot of note taking, reading and homework assignments. There are 5 exams including a final and 4 writing assignments and class assignments. She literally makes it easy for you if you go to class and listen. Definitely would recommend!
If you fail or have failed this class, it is 100% your fault. This professor gives you all the tools to pass. Allows to drop one test and writing assignment if you get 150+ pts on class participationsuper easy. The tests are mostly scenarios, read the cases within the chapter and the ones she assigns and really understand how everything applies.
Prof. Demory is a great professor and lawyer. I can see how this class could have been beyond boring, but she made it so much enjoyable. She very thorough and makes sure that you know the cases and concepts to ace her tests. They are not hard, mostly scenarios, so actually understand the material. Overall, I learned a lot from this class!
Demory is a brilliant professor. She really knows her stuff and teaches it well. I highly enjoyed her class and learned a lot. No frills class three exams and a final. Read the chapters and you should be fine.
I heard that BULE was hard, but it wasn't that bad with Demory in the summer. She is great.  Long tests but OK. She drops the lowest exam grade if you get at least 100pts (easy) on class participation assignments. With writing assignments, you can easily ace it or screw up.  Make sure you use a COURT CASE and the right law/rule. Great lectures.
This is my second time taking Prof. Demory, and again, it was an enjoyable experience. If you have to take MGMT431, I suggest taking it during the summer. The expectations are clear, the essay questions are clear, and so as long as you're doing your reading and learning the material,  you will get an A. I wish Prof. Demory taught more classes.

Teacher comments: 
While he's a really engaging professor, he assigns way too much reading. He expects you to know the text forwards and backwards and gives pop reading quizzes randomly. You'll have 2 writing assignments per week (on average), and he's really big on word counts. Missing one assignment or getting a bad grade on one will bring your grade way down. 2/5
The comments that say he's a tough grader are true. I really had to work for a good grade. He's very opinionated, and will go on about how he's right and you're not. The grading is mostly reading and synthesis posts, but they're really tough. I dreaded this class, and I normally love English. Try to avoid.
Although a lot of people seemed to resent his strict grading policies, I actually found them helpful. They helped me develop paper-writing skills I needed for other classes. Professor Nanian also has a good, slightly sarcastic sense of humor that I really appreciate. He's willing to work with you if you work with him. Overall, a great experience.
I took him for 305, and he's definitely one of the most challenging professors I've ever had. Brutally honest, extremely intelligent, and a bit pretentious at times. That being said, I'd recommend him to English majors, as you'll leave the class a better reader and writer. Between lectures and his thorough written notes, improvement is guaranteed.
You know if you want to pass this class with a good grade, do not take him. e makes it seem like english is your major. I spent wayy too much time on this class which I could have used it in a better way
Dr. Nanian is really tough but honestly it was truly refreshing having a teacher who didn't coddle his students and give everyone A's. I felt like I truly earned my grade and am proud. I would recommend taking him if you want to be a better writer and researcher. Also, don't take his comments on your paper to heart! He's actually really nice!
He knows exactly what he asks for. Details are everything; he's very clear about what he expects from students. The course load is hefty, so don't take him if you're not ready to do work. You end up a better reader and writer after taking his class, you actually feel like you learned something. He cares about his students and makes you work for it.
Dr. Nanian is a passionate professor, but he's a harsh grader and piles on the work. NOT an easy A, and not the kind of class you want to wait until the last minute to do work for. His lectures are fun and discussions are entertaining but the work load is overwhelming. This class is very time consuming, he expects a lot from his students.
Dr. Nanian is a caring professor, but you WILL feel overwhelmed with work. With that said, every other class there is a minimum of 400-500 word paper due, and that must meet all of his requirements. Unless you're willing to work hard, please don't take his course. While he is nice, he is a SERIOUSLY tough grader. Consider your GPA, and think again.
He definitely grades you accordingly, if you half-ass an assignment you will receive a bad grade. If not, you will get a good grade. If you are looking for an easy class, this is not it. Lectures are interesting, there's pop quizzes, and a final exam at the end. There is a reasonable amount of extra credit.
Prof Nanian seems super cool at first, but then once it's too late to switch classes, you realize how tough of a grader he is and how much homework (readings/movies/email homework posts) he gives. If you have 18 credit hours and a part-time job like me, you will NOT have enough time for this class. It's a lot of work and very time consuming.
I went into this class feeling like a decent writer and came out feeling way better than I did going in. I can say that he did teach me a lot of things about writing that I didn't really know before. It feels as though he expects better-than-average writers from the get-go. So beware if you have any doubts with your writing.
Nanian, although pretentious sounding and condescending at times, is a great professor who has a genuine interest in his students abilities. He actually wants his students to know how to write a respectable position paper. Gives great feedback and will tear your paper apart, as well as your self esteem.
Took this class a while ago but I can still remember it like it was last week. Hardest grader I've ever encountered, but he does leave very thorough (sometimes harsh) feedback, although he did take the time to speak to me in class when he wanted to say something complimentary about my work/ideas. Very motivational and made me a much better writer.
I have never cared for Shakespeare. I actively disliked Shakespeare. Professor Nanian managed to make me love Henry V through his lectures. This is not an easy course, and he will definitely make you earn it, but he is the finest professor I have ever had the privilege of learning from.
Took him for a humanities section. Wont sugar coat anything; blunt and will call you out in essays. Will definitely make you a stronger writer, but some people can find his style to be harsh. If you're willing to have someone tear your papers apart for the better, I would recommend him. (midterm1000 word essay, final2500 word research paper)
Most exciting English Lecturer at GMU. Loves this job and he gives thorough responses to papers. Nanian might be the toughest grader at GMU. He is like Simon Cowell; brutal and honest, but when you do well, you deserve it. A worthy adversary and a smart man. Wouldn't take a Nanian class again. It would be like climbing Mt. Everest twice.
If you are ready to be challenged, take Dr. Nanian. He WILL criticize your writing, but it is for your own benefit. Don't get discouraged, even if it feels overwhelming. Don't forget to use all of the resources on his class website, which he puts there on purpose. I enjoyed his lectures, as well as his obvious appreciation of the works we studied.
Professor Nanian happens to be one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. As impossible as this seems, he is condescending about the fact that he knows so much more than us and simultaneously expects us to be at a level way higher than we are. I enjoyed his class a lot; I learned so much and he gave the best feedback. But your GPA suffers.
Nanian stole my passion. Had him for 2 classes in 1 semester - he made me feel unintelligent and small. He gives great feedback, but his grading is unrealistic and does not reflect your improvement (never gotten below an A- in English class before him). Egotistical. Doesn't accept opinions that do not coincide with his own, even with evidence.

LOVE HER. LOVED her class. First class that taught me to think! We didn't just regurgitate her lectures. We actually THOUGHT about stuff. Her lectures are easy to follow, but you'll need to take good notes and ask questions if you don't understand. And tests come from the lectures so attendance is a must.
Terrible teacher, I went to her office hours for help and she pretended to care but when I handed in the project she gave me points off of things that she helped me with. She's tough with grading, makes you know how to spell the names of architects and buildings that are completely ridiculous.
Best professor I've ever had!!! I took her as an elective but she taught me a lot more than just art. Her class consists of mostly lectures but everything she teaches she's passionate about. She teaches in a way in which you are interested and actually understand. I would without a doubt take another class with her!! BEST COLLEGE PROFESSOR!!
HARDEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. I thought this would be an easy class to take as an elective, this ended up being the class I put more effort into to pass than my core classes. Do not take this class if you'e never taken art history before. It is not easy. She gives A LOT of homework, the exams are extremely hard and the textbook is dreadful!
I loved her! Honestly the most interesting professor iv taken so far. Her classes make you want to hop on a plane and go see all the art in the world. The class is an easy A if you give it some effort. Totally worth it!
HIGHLY recommend for your art credit. I struggled a bit at the beginning with the weekly quizzes, but then I contacted Professor Bauman who very accessible and very helpful in giving methods to improve my grade. She is hilarious and made a gen-ed very enjoyable. She treats students like students. As long as you do your part she will do hers.
Amazing professor, absolutely loved coming to this class and learning about art history when it doesnt relate to my major at all. Shes hilarious and caring. She gives quizzes weekly on tuesdays and there is one big art museum project. The attendance grade at the end can boost your grade from B to an A- so show up!!
Amazing lectures, I have learned so much about Art and its history because of her. I feel like I can share what I have learned with my peers! She is super enthusiastic! Either take notes in class or read the book, some of the quizzes are tough (drops 2). 2 fun projects that involve a trip to DC, not too bad. Attendance is mandatory.
Great professor, inspired me into the world of architecture. as long as you come to each class, write notes, solve homeworks, study the study advice well, you should do really well.
AVOID !!!!!!!!!
Professor Bauman is my favorite teacher. She is so passionate about what she teaches that it makes the class very interesting. She has quizzes every week about previous material. If you study for them, you'll be fine. She has two projects about going to the museum, which was fun. There is no final and attendance matters.
She makes a boring subject somewhat manageable. The quizzes are straight forward. You have to attend class to do well because she does not post her PowerPoints on Blackboard.
HANDS DOWN THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT MASON! I CAME IN THINKING THAT ART + HISTORY WILL BE SUPER BORING, BUT OMG DR. BAUMAN IS A REAL GEM! HER LECTURES ACTUALLY TAKE YOU ON AN ADVENTURE INTO THE PAST! SHE MAKES SURE YOU GET THE MATERIAL! SHE IS SUPER COOL!
I loved Dr. Baumans art history class! She is very passionate about her work and always energetic. There are no exams, just a weekly quiz on the material from the previous week so it is an easy A as long as you pay attention and take notes.
Ok I took this as my art elective class. This was harder than my main core classes. I legit had to study so hard for all the exams. It is not multiple choice so you basically need to know it. She doesn't post PP on BB so you have to come and take word for word notes or else you'd fail the exam. This class stressed me out. need to word hard for grde
Yes, she's super friendly and nice but she's all about getting your money's worth out of this class. Even though this is a 100 level class, she makes it seem like its beyond that. DONT TAKE ARTH. FOR YOUR ART CREDIT IF YOU WANT AN EASY A CAUSE THIS CLASS IS DEF NOT THAT!! Get ready to actually think and make connections GOOD LUCK and PRAY FOR ME
AVOID!!DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS FOR YOUR ART CREDIT!!-ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A MATH/SCIENCE PERSON WHOS USE TO JUST KNOWING THE FACTS!! she makes this class so HARD for a INTRO CLASS!! she wants you to think out side of the box -coming from a student who ACTUALLY tries their best in school
Prof Bauman was really great! I'm not an art person, but this class was very interesting and engaging. If you need to knock out an art elective, this is the class to do it in. I learned a lot and honestly enjoyed it a ton.
She is one of the best professors at GMU. She is so nice and sweet. Lectures were always entertaining and she has a great sense of humor. She cares for her students and was always there to help. Easy to talk to and the class was an easy A if you attended lectures and paid attention. I would definitely recommend her!!
If you are interested in any form of art you will love this class. Professor Bauman has a way of connecting with students and really being able to open your eyes to the world. After taking this class, I look at a lot of things from a different point of view. Would definitely recommend to those who aren't art majors, but it doesn't matter either way

Teacher comments: 
If you want to take statistics, take him!! His lectures are amazing and you will learn if you listen to him. His tests are pretty easy if you study the materials he covered and the recitation class is also helpful as well.
The exam was very hard and unfair,Homework is worth only 2 point,He forced us to memorize formula, and what each sign meant,What worse is, he didn't tell us in class which one we had to memorize,Even if half part is open book, it is very hard, Doesn't give enough example in class, You only have 2 exam and 1 final, do bad on 1 and you failed
All of the notes are online, and the tests are half open note. The online notes can be confusing, so make sure to watch the examples during lecture, but it's also safe to skip lectures. Definitely do the homework, it usually takes a few hours but you have a week to do it and it is really similar to test problems.
Interesting teaching and lecture style but notes are very clear and posted online. He's pretty chill. Homework is due once a week but it's direct and follows the lectures.
Lectures aren't necessary if you have experience with statistics, yet they are enjoyable - he is easy to listen to and has a good sense of humor. There are 2 midterm exams and a final, so the grades are relatively test-heavy. Homework is very straightforward and provides a nice cushion to your grade. Overall, would recommend.
Amazing guy! Lectures were funny, but not mandatory if you've had experience w stats before. First exam was wonky-didn't know what to expect. Got a 97.5 on the final- very good teacher. love his website. R program a little difficult-recit is mandatory. homework needs to be printed for recitation. notes he writes in class are okish, online better
He is honestly one of the best professors I've had at Mason so far. I HATE SCIENCE but he made this class really interesting and bearable. He also posts notes but you need to attend the lectures to get the full feel for them. His pop quizzes are HILARIOUS and super easy! He will keep you till class ends but he does give a 10 minute break in between
This is my guy. Awesome class, lectures are a little boring but its def worth going to, pay attention and you will do well and learn everything you'll need. Awesome notes to read before tests. Overall great guy, super nice and friendly. Would absolutely take him again if I could
Dr. Laemmerzahl is an amazing professor! His class is very straightforward, so if you do the work there's no way you won't succeed. His notes are easy to follow &amp; he explains things thoroughly. Definitely take him!
Professor Laemmerzahl is great at explaining things, your only grades are from the easiest pop quizzes (write your name on a piece of paper) and 3 exams. He posts previous exams which are pretty similar to the actual as well as all of his notes. He is a solid choice if you are not that great at Bio because he makes things easy to understand.
Nice guy, can get a little off topic and sometimes won't go over something because it's "too difficult" but he's a pretty good teacher, definitely cares about biology. Attendance isn't technically mandatory but sometimes he gives super easy pop quizzes, where you'll like have to write your name or answer questions on stuff you just went over.
Very easy class and professor. 3 exams (lowest dropped), no textbook, one 1 page paper (not formal at all), and one final presentation. This course is the synthesis course so I would choose this one for an easy A. His notes are simple, typed up like an outline and uses those to make the exams. Memorize notes, pass test. Kind of boring dude, but hey
One of the best teacher at GMU! Take his class, you won't regret it! His lectures are very helpful, you don't need a textbook.
Honestly, an amazing professor! Would recommend. Just come to class and do the homework, the tests couldn't be easier.
Ardnt's cool. Has notes online that r ez 2 follow by urself (no textbook; can skip lecture if u understand them). Lecture's slow/boring (follows notes exactly) but helpful if u don't understand the notes. Tests are short (half closed book about terminology/ideas from notes, other half open book about ?s similar to the hwk) so u got plenty of time.
Dr. Laemmerzahl is awesome! No textbook; he writes the material for the course and it is presented in a very clear and comprehensible way. Attendance optional but necessary if you want to do well, 3 exams with open-note sections! Recitation has weekly assignments. Put forth the effort and you'll definitely do well - I learned a lot in this class!
Great Professor! do all the homework and really understand it because that is what is on your exams . Also, make sure you come to class cause although you can probably get away with just the notes, the notes were a little confusing at times and going to class helps. SUPER amazing lecturer and great for recitation! Approachable and fair.
Although attendance isn't mandatory, he gives pop quizzes and those points are very helpful for your overall grade! I enjoyed his lectures and think he was a great professor.
Very engaging and provides numerous examples of statistical problems. If you prefer step-by-step instructions he is a good professor in that sense. Started to go to class A LOT less but his thorough notes will do just fine. Notes are very extensive but easy to follow along. Exams are half open book, half closed.
He's a great professor, very sweet and cute. When I went to visit in office hours tho he seemed abrupt. Isn't always available. Talks a lot- but good because makes you understand the material. Always asks if audience has questions- people don't usually ask but its nice.

Teacher comments: 
Dr. Bedore hands down is the best mentor I have ever had, she is very kind hearted and pure spirited. Very attentive, caring and understanding. Dr. Bedore will definitely push you out of your comfort zone and does an amazing job at giving positive feedback, she even helped me as a mother. She shared so many stories and lessons that truly touched me
By far the best professor I have ever had in my life. Dr. Bedore is an amazing speaker, and can improve communications in any setting. She is truly talented and a fantastic public speaking professional. This university will not be the same without her, but I wish her the best of luck and success.
Amazing professor and speaker. Her passion to make sure her students not only excel in the class, but beyond, is phenomenal. I am positive that what I learned in her class will stick with me from here on forth both in my social and professional life. She's inspirational and is also a great mentor. Thank you Dr. Bedore!
Dr. Bedore is an amazing professor! She makes class fun to attend. I wish for the best for you in Florida!
Best professor I've ever had, hands down. Her passion for her students and energetic teaching made class exciting. Her stories not only made the material easier to understand, but were also amusing and insightful. I highly recommend taking this course. Also,if you're looking for an inspiring speaker, she definitely won't disappoint.
This will be your most unforgettable class ever. Class is not hard, and she always compliments you whenever you make progress. Amazing professor. You will hear many sincere stories in class. And if you like in-class games, then this is the right one for you. You won't regret!
Dr. Bedore is the best professor I have ever had. She encourages interaction during lectures which made them really fun and interesting. Her assignments were very helpful for learning the material. I learned a lot in her class, I would recommend it because is very useful.
She's so energetic, you won't fall asleep even if you take her early in the morning. She isn't a hard grader, but she is strict about turning in all work and attendance.  but other than that it's very chill and a good way to start the day. also summer 2013 is her last semester!
Amazing the only class I took on a Friday morning and never hated a minute of it. She is a great professor and helps you no matter what the situation.
Comm 101 with Dr. Bedore was honestly an easy A.  She is ALWAYS smiling even in the 9am class. The assignments are mostly straight out of the book, with detailed examples for the essays.  You can simply copy the format for outlines/essays, so I don't see why anybody can't get an A. Overall an easy and enjoyable class.
Dr. Bedore was probably the best teacher I had this semester. She really tries to help you out and is a lot easier than the other comm teachers from what I heard. She's also very funny and nice!
Best Professor at Mason period!! She has wonderful stories to tell, class was always interesting and very meaningful. She taught me more than I would've expected when I signed up for classes. Like she said this should be Life101 instead of Comm101.
I had Dr. Bedore this past spring and she was by far one of the best teachers I've ever encountered. Her stories make the information easy to remember and interesting as well and she is just an all around great person, I absolutely loved her! Definitely a best professor at Mason hands down!
Dr. B was great! Whenever anybody was confused with a concept, guidelines for a project, etc. she was very helpful! She's also funny and keeps a lively class atmosphere! :)
OMG Dr. Bedore is hands-down the best professor I've had in my entire academic career.  She kept me engaged with her stories, helped with any confusion, and spiritually guided us to becoming better, more complete people.  This class should be called LIFE 101, not Comm 101, since she teaches everybody the best life lessons that I'll carry forever.
Class was never boring, plenty of stories to keep you interested, she clearly loves her job, and does a good job of getting nervous individuals over their fear of speaking in front of groups.  Paper grading is kinda random, and gives examples of what NOT to do with the format rather than what will get you a good grade. Take her! You won't regret it
Best teacher ever! I had her this semester and I enjoyed going to class each day. She really cares about her students and does her best to help. Her stories were also great to hear! I recommend taking this class!!!!
Best Professor at Mason, if she isn't the best I'm dropping out of college! Her class is fun and  helpful. I love Dr. B class if I had the chance I would take the class over again just to hear the story she tell.
Dr. Bedore is great. I took her this semester and really enjoyed it. She is very positive and helpful. She responds to e-mails quickly and with a lot of help. I DEFINITELY recommend taking this class with Dr. Bedore. She has interesting stories, and it was a great way for me to start my morning in her class.
She's GREAT! Take her class!!!
Teacher name: Madden, Charles
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
Madden is a great professor, he is very funny, his class is based off four exams and eye clicker quizzes which take the place of your lowest exam grade.
Professor Madden kept class interesting by showing a lot of pictures along with the lecture slides so that we could understand what was being taught. He tells a lot of dad jokes which is pretty funny sometimes. Class is relatively easy as long as you pay attention or watch the lectures later at home.
He makes the material harder than it has to be. He does great curves. It's the only way to pass his class tbh. The hardest exam is the second so get ready to fail that one. The final is cumulative but its not hard. It is just general questions from the previous tests. He tries to make the class and he is really funny. Has random puns here and there
Dr Madden is awesome, hes a very nice person and will do his best to have his students end up with a good grade. His exams are tough but he usually gave a curve and drops one exam grade. I didnt come to class much and ended up with a good grade. Love this guy
Take him. He's the best.
Unless you're passionate about Biology, do not take him. The way he explains things is so hard to understand. He barely addresses the stuff on the slides and instead talks about random stuff that's way more complicated. He takes 5 minutes to answer one question because he starts talking about unrelated stuff. Had to teach myself the whole class.
Hands down the best professor you could ask for. Posts all of his lectures just incase you need to review, drops the lowest exam (including the cumulative final), he is so articulate and is so knowledgeable. The only thing is some exam questions are tricky, but an A is very attainable if you just study the powerpoints posted. SO GREAT. TAKE HIM!
Had him before for 213 &amp;305, really nice and good at explaining material. only 3 exams no projects, the final is the third exam its not cumulative. textbook is optional, listen to audio recordings more helpful
I noticed a lot of people think the class is hard, but I thought it was easy.. i guess it depends on the person. Every brain is different. Def dont need textbook. He is super great for self-esteem, as he complimented me about literally everything you can think of. He is *extremely* charming &amp; always up for meeting anywhere at all. Gave me his cell
I found this class pretty difficult because I didn't take AP Bio in high school or Biol 103 at GMU. Dr. Madden makes the class extremely interesting, and make sure you study a little bit every day because the powerpoints are packed with information you may or may not have heard of. Lecture/textbook not mandatory. Recommend him to pre-med students.
I really like that tests arent the only things that are put towards your grade, theres online homework that helps with your grade which i really like. He's a nice professor, study guides are similar to tests but tests are still tricky so still study a lot. ask any questions, he will definitely answer without attitude.
I love Dr. Madden! I thought his lectures were interesting, well-organized, and helped me understand so I could succeed. His PowerPoints are thorough and covered all material on the tests. Don't bother buying the book, I didn't open it once the entire semester and I wasted my money.
difficulty of class Depends what your standards are/ where you come from. range of students here so mixed opinions on that. Book was worthless to buy. He would contradict it sometimes. He was extremely charming and did wonders for my self esteem as he gave me the best compliments ever and gave me tons of attention. Made me feel special
Easy A! Dont have to read. Just attend lecture or listen to lectures he posts. He is very charming and highly accessible. Will meet with you outside the school as well and he gave me his cell, so I could contact him whenever! He really boosted my confidence too always gave me compliments.
RUDE, awful choice, I got the grade but I did it on my own his lectures are pointless. study the material on your own, he rambles in lecture and skips over numerous slides, not even worth going just google it instead. drops lowest test score, the curve is only a 2-3 question curve. If ur cool with studying on your own then sure take him, if not LLL
did better just skipping class and studying the study guides on my own. just look over slides (posts them) and know why each answer is wrong and right and define all of the options and you're golden. Would not recommend him, awful lecturer, rude, iclckers are not worth it (bad lectures poor iclickers scores) study on your own all test multi choice
Madden is a solid choice for this bio class. Cell structure and function (Bio 213) is a pre req. for med school so the course is hard but if you cant pass the class, what is your chance of doing well in Med school? Madden respects his students and questions that they have. Just keep the questions on topic...
Professor Madden is the best biology professor Ive had in my whole college career. He did a 20% curve towards the end of the semester(I originally had a C, but ended up with an A-). There are iclicker quizzes every other class which can raise your grade by a letter if you do them all. The tests derive from the practice exams. Take him!!
Took this prof for both 213 + 305, very good at lecturing. Exams are difficult but if you show up to class/listen to his video lectures &amp; study the powerpoints you should do fine. No book req.,attendance not mandatory however there are optional iclicker quizzes in class which can make a difference in your grade by one letter. Drops lowest exam.
Skipped most classes towards the end and still did fine because I watched video lectures he posted online. His lectures are actually entertaining to watch because he tells stories and cracks jokes related to the topic- which in itself is pretty cool. 100% take him!
Teacher name: Crossin, Karen
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: female
Teacher comments: 
Such a good prof!! She makes the class bearable (esp if you don't like math) and is super engaging in class. Would DEF take again and I highly recommend!
She is someone who WANTS to work with students to make sure they understand the material and will pass the class. The discussion board was used to ask questions so other students could help. Her practice tests and homework gave you a good idea of what the tests were going to be like. I loved it.
I love her so much! She is lovely and she will help you understand basic math. The work she has you do has a purpose and if you want to be an elementary teacher you will love learning the different styles. Everyone who gave her a bad rating is just salty that they don't know how to do basic math. Seriously, she is very understanding and funny.
This class is hybrid so you spend one day in class a week and the rest is online. There's three paper tests (including the final) and the other two are online. Professor Crossin is a very bubbly teacher and good wake me up for a 9 am course. Going to class is not mandatory since it is online as well but you get 10 easy points for going.
I took MATH106 online and it was particularly easy. The professor lets you have cheat sheets during tests and homework is easy to complete. 5 discussion boards are due throughout the entire semester but they're easy.
Lets get one thing clear: math is my least favorite thing in the world. Prof Crossin made it easy and enjoyable. I took the online class but she was always available for questions, very kind, &amp; made me somewhat enjoy math! For the summer class it was a few math assignments per week, two online tests, one in person midterm &amp; one in person final
A great professor. She really went out of the way to ensure everybody in the class learned the material and explained in detail. Very funny and an all around great class that I looked forward to going to
Condescending, rude, slow to reply, wrong answers in the study guide key. If these are things you enjoy, then professor Crossin is a perfect fit for you! I earned an A in this class, but she constantly made mistakes, fessed up those mistakes, yet would continue to be rude and condescending if you asked simple questions. How ironic. Stay away
I love Karen! This is the second class I've taken with her and I've enjoyed it. She is always available during office hours and truly cares about her students. She has a bold personality and sometimes gets off topic, but she is so much fun. I've learned so much from her. Take her class.
Class was easy over all. Your whole grade is based of your HW basically. and she grades harsh on those. Accuracy matters. Ive gotten A's on every test yet still have a C in the class because of homework. Test looks just like review. Was rude when you contacted her but other than that no problems. Participation matters even though she didnt say
It's an online course, so everything is put up on BB; tests are taken in-person. There's homework every week, mostly online and some written, but it's easy and not long. The 3 tests are very easy and she gives a practice test before each one that's almost exactly the same as the actual test. Highly recommend taking it as your required math course!
I took her online class over the summer, so the material was a lot and very condensed into a month.  As long as you do the homework, you will be fine.  I have struggled with math since elementary school and was extremely nervous taking math over the summer.  I would definitely recommend taking her! Very nice person too.
I love Professor Crossin! She's hilarious and makes math fun. She's also super approachable and caring. I usually hate math but Professor Crossin converted me! She offers little extra credit assignments here and there, and she's always willing to spend time with you to help you succeed. I would HIGHLY recommend her! Her hybrid class is awesome!
I loved having her. I was in a hybrid class, so we only met once a week, and the rest was done online. She used a lot of helpful examples in class, and she made a lot of jokes. At the end of the semester, you have a choice on how you want to be graded, and she always hands out practice problems before a test. The quizzes are easy enough.
Granted, math is my worst subject, but this was the most difficult class I've taken going into Senior year. The homework took forever and I still needed a tutor because the material wasn't clear. She tried to help the class out by giving several extra credit opportunities, but I wish the tests didn't count so much. Allows a half page notes at tests
There are only two Prof.  that teach MATH 271&amp;272 and Prof. Crossin just so happens to be the lesser of two evils. The homework load is ridiculous and no, it did not help me understand the material. People find her insanity amusing but to me she was annoying. She makes you learn the material by yourself and expects you to understand it. Be prepared
Karen was one of the best professors I have ever had. She truly cares about her students and tries to help them understand the material. She gives out a lot of homework, but it really helps you understand what is going on in class. She also sets up her classes in teams, so you help your classmates learn the material as well. I highly recommend!!!!
If you're really close to a higher grade, she'll give you that grade. She won't give out C minuses if you're between a 70 and 72 which is helpful so you don't have to retake. Giving out extra credit for correcting mistakes helps encourage class participation. She also has a lot of helpful tricks which can help memorize formulas.
I took Boyette for 271, but that was a big mistake so I took Crossin for 272. Honestly, she is so amazing. She cares about all her students and is always there if you ask for help. Her study guides are relevant to the exam. There is a lot of homework, but it really does help you understand the material. I would definitely recommend her!
LOVED HER! Any person who has ever had trouble in math should take her class. She has a unique teaching style that I receptive to and fought math in ENGLISH and not a way that a non-mathy person can understand. Go to class and pay attention, and you'll be fine! She's also hilarious and for that I really enjoyed going to her class. 10/10 recommend
Teacher name: Lyons, Michael
School name: George Mason University
Teacher gender: male
Teacher comments: 
He is a tough professor, but he knows the material without question. His lectures are long but very informative. I would only take him online so that way you can review lectures at your leisure when studying for tests and not have to worry about notes in class. The HW is short but intensive, the midterm and final are easy if you know the material.
Class is a complete waste of time, Lyons has taught 467 for so many years, but every class literally feels like he makes it up as he goes. Most of class is spent trying to help him troubleshoot his examples &amp; trying to follow along with him with only a light understanding of the relevance. Classmates are lost and don't know whats going on.
People dislike Lyons b/c they're not used to education outside the U.S. He's got a strict style, and is very picky about the quality of work. Exam questions come straight from the the lecture- take in depth notes and pay attention. Be active in the semester long project just like your personal life - check your email, news and wikis everyday!
The class has A LOT of material, so make sure to review every week in order to prepare for both midterm/final. The final wasn't as bad as the midterm but it is cumulative. I would suggest taking light courses because this class will take a lot of your time. About 6 HWs, and weekly blackboard responses. Prof. Lyons tries his best to help students.
Prof Lyons is better than what I heard and what I thought. Yes, he may seem rude, but that's not true. He is so helpful, and when I asked him, he tried to explain it in details. His exams are hard, but if you pay attention to each single word in his lecture, you gonna pass it with a high grade. I also decided to take another class with him.
This is a confusing class.  He lectures a lot and all of the midterm questions are created from his lecture/videos so pay attention.  First half to midterm is fairly easy.  There is one major group project that lasts the whole semester you will have to be creative, however the requirements are rather ambiguous.  Participate as best you can.
Lyons gets a bad rap but I thought his 366 course was enjoyable. He provides very detailed lectures (sometimes too detailed) but if you pay attention you will learn the material. The exams are more difficult than the study guides entail, but if you take notes during the lecture on what he talks about in relation to the topics, you'll be okay.
Barely learned anything, spent more time troubleshooting his own examples than lecturing. 1 Phrase to summarize this class - Wasted potential
This class revolves around a project that you are given minimal instructions on. Lyons comes into class everyday with his same rude attitude. His lectures barely touch on the syllabus,  the exams are really tough. This class and the instructor serve as a prime example of Mason's lack of consideration for the education they provide to their students
I've really started to not enjoy his lectures. At first I thought he was going to be the best professor I've ever had, and for the most part he's very professional, but he talks about numerous topics that aren't that specific to Security WAY to in depth. He's definitely smart, I just wish he was smart enough to focus on what matters for IT Security
Prof. Lyons knows his stuff. Lectures are of good quality. You will have to work hard to earn the grade you want, nothing is given to you. Very strict on grading for assignments. Fair grader on exams.   IT304 was not his class, he filled in for another professor so things were rough. I'm sure that in his own classes things would go smoother.
Never had him before but had a good experience with his online 366 class. Managed to earn an A and my only advice is to answer every question in the midterm and final study guides and memorize them. That will guarantee you an A
I had heard a couple bad things about him but taking 366 over the summer online with him wasn't bad. It is mainly about self study but his lectures were helpful. He was also accessible via email. My only complaint was that we didn't get any grades back until almost the end of the semester. Know all of the study guides for midterm and final to pass.
One thing that professor Lyons forgets is you need your GPA as much as you need the knowledge. He teaches you well but exams are way tougher than lecture. You wouldn't know whether you are passing or failing untill the end if the semester because he doent post grades. You get the knowledge but with bad GPA. The only C you have will be his classes.
Here are the things you should know about the course and the professor; you cant miss lecture, you should take notes for the entire 3 hours of lecture word by word, group project is 30% and no guidance is provided by the professor, homeworks are concentrated towards the second half. The professor is smart but the course is irrelevant to info-sec.
this class is like trying to smell the number fourteen
This course revolves around a project that makes up the majority of your grade. He provides ZERO instruction or guidance as to what he wants us to do, but expects A-quality work. In addition to that, he is very unapproachable with questions you might have. Lastly, the course is just irrelevant, has no structure, and it just needs to be removed.
Lyons gets a bad rap, but he is just the no non-sense type of professor. His default is treat everyone as a threat to course. But after he has made his direction for the class clear and everyone is on the same page things will improve. His assignments are not given to confuse students, but rather to teach them. His study guides are just everything.
This guy is the prime example of whats wrong with academia. He is rude, opressive, and has no clear understanding/vision of the course. He is more involved in kicking students out of class because they drank out of a water bottle than teaching Information Defense Technologies. When he does, he speaks for two hours about vietman and WWII battles.
What really concerned me are the quizzes he assigned. I felt I answered it correctly but was only given partial or no credit. He can be rude to some students. Most of the homework are easy though.
