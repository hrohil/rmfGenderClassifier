This guy follows the book "to a T" and gave exactly one half of the class an A or A-. He is also a decent teacher who tried to make his office hours very accessible.
He does not give good lectures, he kind of just does his own thing on the board without looking back. His lectures are easy, but his homework assignments are so complicated! His lectures are disconnected from the homework, which is disconnected from the quizzes, which is disconnected from the tests. This is supposed to be a very easy class, but....
