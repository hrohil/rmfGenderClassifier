Jon is good. He assigns weekly lab and mid-terms. He is patient and humorous in class and very approachable outside the classroom. He provides a solid foundation for Computer Science major and is not a harsh grader. Just be prepared to do the readings and lab each week. I learned a lot in his class and want to take his class again.
