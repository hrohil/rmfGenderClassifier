Loved the way she ran her intro programming class. She only lectures for AT MOST 40 of the 80 minutes (&amp; more likely closer to 10 min), and then we spent the rest of the class working on programs while she walked around the class and helped. One-on-one she is a phenomenal teacher. Very patient and willing to stay after to help. Also, an easy grader
She is very willing to help you if you are engaged and hard working.
She can be a little hard to understand during lecture, but if you meet with her during office hours, or even just call her aside for a second during class, she'll clear up what you need to know right away. She's frank and no-nonsense, but if you really are interested in logiccomp sci, she's a great introduction. Would (do) recommend.
Prof Ramyaa does not make any of her instructions very clear and uses even more confusing metaphors to explain abstract ideas that dont add to our understanding of the task at hand. Extremely confusing at times with many moments when we sit in class silently not knowing what to do while trying to avoid her disdain when we tell her we dont get it.
Professor Ramyaa was generally very clear and kept the class on a manageable pace. This was my first comp sci class and I really enjoyed it. She is super helpful in office hours and very easy to reach out to.  If you pay attention to class and do your homework, you'll do well and learn a lot of basic programming.
She is not clear during class time, but is extremely helpful during office hours. Ramyaa is a bit disorganized in terms of not having a clear syllabus. (Her syllabus was a notepad file with incomplete sentences  and grammar mistakes), but she's very willing to answer questions and help students during class.
By far, my worst experience with a class at Wesleyan. She does not explain things well at all, her writing is unclear, she does not go through the process of writing codes and algorithms in class. She pulls up a bunch of pre written codes and expects the students to just get it. Very disappointed that this was my first compsci class here
