This is a pretty good teacher who lectures clearly and tries really hard to be nice. But he's defensive, assumes you already know all kinds of stuff to be in his class, then gets frustrated if what he said isn't totally obvious to you right away.
great!
106B is a great class and Chris Gregg filled in so many holes in my CS understanding. This is the key course to move forward, and this teacher totally gets it!
This teacher may come off as a bit conservative and rigid, but when you get used to his teaching style you see he's very consistent and wants you to be too. Super nice, really wants you to succeed and have a solid CS foundation.
He is a very good lecturer, but doesn't like to live code in class and sometimes can't understand if you can't understand.
Awesome prof! Super clear, helpful, and sooooo patient and caring with students.
Makes even the obscure and ugly math parts of CS interesting
