I think he was a pretty good teacher considering it was his first year. He is very nice and approachable and genuinely wants you to understand the material. He tries his best to make the material interesting and his office hours are extremely helpful. I'd definitely take another class if he taught one.
I really love this class! I took it for the gen ed but honestly Jeffrey is such a good prof. I would hands down take another class with him! He is so kind and truly seems to care about his students. Gotta use poll everywhere for attendance but there is extra credit available from the homework. Definitely take this class for the QR gen ed!
Jeffrey is one of the best profs I've ever had! He is so enthusiastic about the material and REALLY knows what he's talking about. Plays songs at the beginning of every class and is so funny. 6 quizzes, lowest dropped, no midterm, one final. Problem sets are tricky sometimes but you can resubmit until you get full credit, and offers ec. Take him!
This is Jeffrey's first time teaching by himself and it shows. He taught the class out of order on accident and put material on a quiz that he hadn't taught yet. He then went over the material that was on the quiz like a week later. Now I realize why the quiz averages were so low. He's over-enthusiastic and that can get annoying.
Overwhelmingly positive which could be annoying. The order he structures his lectures could be difficult to understand at times. for example, he would start using terms we haven't discussed yet in class and would give the definition later on which made it hard for me to follow along.
prof young worked with prof kris and they're like a dream team. songs before every class honestly eased anxiety of whatever tf was about to come. I had never programmed (hence comp101) and didnt think i would care about the class at all, but they made it painless. quizzes are brutal if you don't attend class AND follow along. office hours saves!
Amazing. Best teacher I've ever had. I wish he taught for every class.
Professor Young is a great lecturer and is always dressed up so nicely!! Would love to have him again for COMP 110.
