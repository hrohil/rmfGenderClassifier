Todd is the most unflexable borish man that may exist on this earth. This is a 1000 level introductory class and yet with the extensive in-class assignements whcih can NEVER be completed using just in class time to the homework whcih may just take you 10 hrs to complete, this class might as well be a 5000 level CS major only class.
If you have programming experience going in, this class is perfectly fine, the tests are just hard. He does a pretty terrible job teaching, just reading slides. HW is usually pretty easy with a couple exceptions. Major projects are harder and take a decent amount of time
Awful teacher. I came in with no coding experience and was immediately lost. Inaccessible and frankly rude outside of class when asking questions. Quizzes and exams are worded confusingly and he often makes mistakes.
Gives assignments on coding, but all grading is done through an online grader; to pass, you need to go to class and record every minor detail he might drop on how to format your code, because the assignments are written rather vaguely.  Office hours were a must, otherwise the chances of getting every formatting detail correct are minimal.
not good at all!
Dr. Stevens was fine for about the first half of the semester when the programming was simple after that though when the class got more into C++ he would just throw code up on the board and expect everyone to understand it since it made sense to him. Be prepared to teach yourself and a lot of GTA office hours since the textbook is little to no help
Dr. Stevens has a bad way of skipping over crucial details.  For example, he didn't explain to our class the important process of declaring variables, but spent 45 minutes explaining the implications of the uber-simple "x++" command.  I'm glad I went in with some programming experience, otherwise I would have been completely lost, as many were.
