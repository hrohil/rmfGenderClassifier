Gives out few assignments, but does not demonstrate any ability to do them himself.  Teaches you many things, but few are related to the assignments.  If you ask a question, he'll dodge it, mumble incoherently, or insult you.  Unfortunately, he has tenure.  Textbook use is "high" because that's the only way you'll learn anything.
Has never helped with any homework assignments.  Either repeats stuff forever or skims it unintelligibly.  Has assigned homeworks asking questions about un-covered subjects.
Hard to communicate with at times; misunderstandings abound.  When we had meetings with him about our labs, he kept several of us waiting, for 2 hours, as he helped ONE other student, despite said student repeatedly asking if she should let us go ahead.
I like Dr. Canas, but he lets students ask the same question 16 times just because they didn't bother to listen the first 15 times.  That gets annoying to anyone who paid attention the first time.  I also wish he would prepare more in advance.
