Great professor. Very organized lecture, clear and on point.
He was a great lecturer. I also think the way he organize class work helped students gain quite deep understanding of the materials that are covered.
You do projects roughly once a week and have tests and "pop" quizzes (you usually know when they are) on a fairly regular schedule, plus daily readingassignments for a while. I felt Dr. Lall did an excellent job pandering the material to majors and non-majors alike. He's an awesome lecturer. I'd recommend him to anyone.
Computer Science is a wonderful class. However, it is more time consuming than some of my 300-level math courses. Very fun! Lall is a great professor, if a little bit too demanding.
Great professor extremely friendly learned everything with ease but it was never dumbed down. I recommend taking a class with him.
I had him in only one course, Game Design. This course was easy for an upper level elective for CS Majors, but was understandable since this was the first time it was offered. Overall he's pretty good professor and is helpful and there if you need him. Also a cool guy and very nice outside of class. He also referred me to get a summer internship.
He has an extremely logical mind. His grading system is perfect and transparent. He is the best professor that I've ever had.
Possibly one of the best teachers/professors I have ever come across. Lall is the fairest prof I've ever had when it comes to grading and assigning work. He wants everyone to succeed. I took an intro class and, although it was very time consuming, the work is completely manageable. I highly recommend Lall.
