It's not so much that he was a hard teacher--he just expects so much of people around him.  He's the greatest encourager I've ever known.  He could see greatness in me before I had a clue of that, myself.  He didn't use textbooks so much; rather, he made it possible for us to meet and know the authors of the leading texts.  That's much better!
I had Mr. Anderson in 1987.  He was a great teacher.  Very understandable and had a sense of humor.  He knows what he is talking about.
He is the #1 professor I have had in my LIFE! I have my Masters &amp; more than half of my PhD done so that is saying a lot! He has such a big heart. He will make you critically think &amp; make you EARN your knowledge! MSU is stupid to lose such an AWESOME Prof!
