Excellent professor, difficult problem sets became manageable in time for tests and test questions are only slightly more difficult than in class problem sets. Keep up though and go to office hours if you have difficulties
Hardest class I have ever taken at Columbia, homework is optional but mastering all assignments is the only way to have a chance on the tests. Very good professor though
Honestly, his class isn't as bad as people say. He is a very brilliant teacher and wants his students to succeed. Very tough class though, it helps to come in with some background
Data Structures is a very challenging class, but Professor P knows what he is talking about, definitely go to office hours! Very talented teacher, hard to believe it's his first year teaching
Professor P was the best! His analogies and hands-on approaches made data structures a very enjoyable class. His tests are brutal though, so study!!
