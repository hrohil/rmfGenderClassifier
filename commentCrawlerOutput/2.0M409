Language problems but he provided a lot of materials. Helpful during the lab and homework.
He's completely useless. His accent is thick, and you won't understand a word he says. However his class is probably easier than your other options.
Go to lab, submit the assignments on time, and do the practice questions from the test books online text bank. Of the 200 questions online for each chapter, he puts 50 on the test.
