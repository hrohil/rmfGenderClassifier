Prof. Romalewski is not a good lecturer and is all over the place.  He is way more confusing in person than going directly from the book.  You are only graded on 3 things: midterm, project and final.  Screw one up, and you're screwed. Follow the book and pay attention to the supplemental stuff he posts online.
He's very incoherent and skips around during class. It's hard to pay attention. If you really want to learn from this class, read the text book.
He is all over the place.  I have no idea what he saying half the time.
