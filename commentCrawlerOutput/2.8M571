Albert is a real gem! I am a better programmer because of him and his every helpful office hours. His jokes could use some work but besides that I am happy with his teaching.
Really bad with teaching. He speaks really softly so it is hard to hear him and most people treat his class as a joke. In office hours he is a bit better, but not by much. He has told several students that he did not know what was wrong with their code and have left them to figure it out. If possible, avoid if you wish to learn anything.
Dr. Jiang knows his stuff, but still has a lot to learn regarding teaching. He is difficult to follow strictly because of how softly he speaks. There were only 2 homework assignments, 2 tests, and one 10-minute presentation with a paper for the final. I barely put any work in, expected a B but got an A.  Overall, lacks structure, but knowledgeable.
