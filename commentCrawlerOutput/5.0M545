I had Billy @ Tulane in Madison MS for three or four classes. I got more out of his class and class discussions than I ever would have thought going in, and on subjects I thought I had so much experience with that I thought the class would bore me. Phenomenal instructor. Highly recommended.
Very interactive, practical.  Great class!
Great practical lecture and labs involved in his class.
