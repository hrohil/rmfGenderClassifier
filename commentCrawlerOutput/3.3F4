Professor Chen was desperate to get the class to participate, yet nobody participated because her lectures were somewhat convoluted. Very tough intro course, especially because it was a very foreign subject to the majority of the students. Very tough grading criteria, need to work hard for a good grade.
Professor Chen was a wonderful lecturer. Coming to class was the single most helpful way to do well on assignments and exams. The exams were very difficult but graded fairly. Professor Chen was helpful both inside and outside of class.
Really tough grader. Classes were pretty mediocre. Helpful in office hours. Wouldn't recommend.
Professor is super nice but the class is very dry and can be confusing sometimes. The material is not hard at all but exams can be very tricky. She grades HARD.
Prof. Chen is the best!  To get the most out of the class, go to her office hours.
