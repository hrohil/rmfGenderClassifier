This class was worthless.  It should be about hacking, but instead he wants to give lectures on lock picking, airport security, penetration testing -- all of this corporate world stuff that doesn't teach anything about systems.  The projects were ok but I recommend 167 and 168 for better everything on systems

what an awful class, it doesn't get much worse....they need to get someone else to teach this class and let him teach upper level stuff to students that will understand
