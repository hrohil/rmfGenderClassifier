More than anything, he really loves the stuff that he teaches.  His enthusiasm is infectious. Great prof.
great, but you got to like cpsc if not it can be boring... great prof all in all though.
The material was really hard, his grades were extremely generous. The lecture was incredibly boring but informative.

The class was very boring and not what I thought it was going to be.  There was a lot of focus on how computers work instead of on computer privacy issues.  There is a lot of out of class work which is actually really interesting.  I learned a lot but it was not fun.  Better if you love CS.
