Brilliant - very insightful with regards to CS-y things. If you have her for advising, she'll ramble on about her life as well, which is amusing but not so great if you need to get somewhere. Has a great, sarcastic, sense of humor. Very adamant about her beliefs (both coding and personal), so be prepared for a good debate if you disagree with her.
Very good at conveying the material. Makes any class considerably harder. When grading, rather than focus on the important concepts, will nit-pick students to death.
Very good prof, but makes any class she touches 10% harder.
