Devin Pohly is a professor who sincerely cares about his students. Especially with a small class size, he is able to help each student achieve an understanding of the material and he makes himself available to help with projects. Be aware that, at least for this class, it is based almost entirely around code, so it may be difficult to take notes.
Dr. Pohly is an amazing professor and I highly recommend him. His tests are difficult, but he is a generous grader. He really values learning and is always willing to answer questions. He is also easily the funniest professor I have ever had. One of the best parts about being a Computer Science major at Wheaton is the faculty.
Dr. Pohly is a great guy who makes class super fun. He also just doesn't quite realize how brilliant he is, which can make class a bit difficult at times. I took him for his first semester at Wheaton when he was still adjusting from grad school, so likely things will get a bit easier. He is a clear lecturer and always willing to help.
