For how difficult the subject is, Martha makes the material very understandable. Her lectures are amazing and help a lot with projects. Course is 4 projects with no midterms or finals, projects are challenging but very doable, even if you don't go to class commonly. Also completely unrelated but hands down the hottest professor at Columbia.
Jointly taught class; she taught MIPS assembly part. Assignments are tough, and tests even tougher, if you do not understand the material. Some people don't go to class at all, bored by lectures andor course material, but then they struggle very hard on their own. Midterm grades may be low, and likely so are final grades. Difficult class overall.
Awful teacher, she expects you to know everything she does and her lectures teach you nothing. No one stays awake in class if they actually go. She makes tests way harder than anything you've seen in homeworks or in the book. The average on our midterm was just above 50. Do not take a class with this professor if you can avoid it.
