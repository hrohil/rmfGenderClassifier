i loved dr. allen! he is this sweet old man who loves his students. yes, slightly boring and slow class, but i was req to take it.
Dr. Allen makes Computer Skills so easy.  He's so friendly, too.  Absolutely take his class.
This guy is awsome...take him
Kind, sincere, so excited about teaching, very eager to help, jokes in class, a bit of a pushover. Great guy. Take comp essentials from him, no other. Iff you are familiar with computers, his class is unbearably slow and more like an hour of free-time.
