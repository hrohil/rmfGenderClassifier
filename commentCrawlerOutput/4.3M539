I had Vipin as my TA for Dr. Alijani's (who is also amazing) class, and he was the most dedicated teacher I've had in my four years here. He was so great at explaining everything, his review sessions were very helpful, and I very much hope that everyone gets the chance to have him as their teacher.
He goes through everything really well... a lof of bonus points and he wants you to get an A. Right now I have almost a 100% in the class because of bonus points and he goes over all homework/quiz problems. Deffinitly would reccoment taking
Easiest class this semester, probably of all classes I will take in college. I cant stress enough how easy itis  Does homework he assigns in class for you. Gives out lots of bonus points for tests(9 for 1 test). Class is also entertaining cuz of all the nerdy computer kids who talk about light sabers and gravity guns and stuff i know nothing about.
Vipin is a great teacher, all around.  He really cares about his students, much more so than any other professor typically would.
Those other people are full of crap.  I took this class last semester and Vipin's a great guy.  There is no limit to the things he will do for a student and he truly goes above and beyond.  He teaches things very well and does not test too badly.  The review sessions are the best part of the class, go to them.  They help with the test, trust me.

This guy is most very very overhelpful guy in the whole world. He will probably pull you out of your room 4 in the morn to tell you something you already knew. He is very slow and if you ask him anything from the middle of the book, he will look at you funny and start explaining from the begining of the book. Avoid review sessions with him.
This guy has an anger problem! "He is on the control tip!"
