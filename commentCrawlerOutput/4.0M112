Prof. Z is one of the best professors that I have had. I learned valuable and useful real world skills in this class. His stories are inspirational and interesting. I don't think it's an easy 'A' because I had to spend a lot of time every week writing papers and the 10-page take home final. I'd take another class with him in a heartbeat.
If you want a sure shot A, take his class. If you get a A- that means that you did a blunder. Professor gives really good grades. He teaches you some key lessons which are good to hear. Slides are very boring and just explains the things that we all know. Since this is a mandatory class, take it and get an A. That's it. Invest around 2.5 hours week
Useless lectures, definitely a waste of time. Don't try
His COEN 287 is boring. He just pours all the concepts to you and aids with some boring stories. Most of the things he teaches are just common sense
My favourite professor of all at Santa Clara and possibly in my whole college career. He teaches you important content for your software engineering future but also for the integrity of your life, truly inspirational and makes you want to live up to high ideals.
Professor Zoltan is amazing and humble person, he is very knowledgeable.  His lectures are backed by his through experience and relatable stories. Assignments and journals are necessary, those will help in final exam. There is Group project but it is easy.
He is the best instructor ever! He used to be my professor for Software Eng. Capstone. He is a very knowledgeable person who has a strong work ethic. Everyone I know is truly satisfied with his class!
