Super nice guy who knows his stuff. Laid-back, wants students to succeed. But the course is better for people who already work in IT Security. Lectures are unclear for a novice, and assignments are confusingly convoluted. Very slow grader despite two (!) GAs. We've been waiting a month for one grade. If you're a novice you need feedback faster.
Strong educator who really knows his stuff.  A great lecturer.  This is a graduate level class so the expectations are high, as they should be.  I would gladly have him for more courses.
