Good at simplifying things and giving concrete examples Asks questions similar to hw questions in the exam Hints questions (not covered in lectures) one week before the midterm and asks in the midterm exam Doesn't really have office hours, too busy Doesn't know how to pick good TAs Can cancel 6 classes in a semester Cares about attendance too much
I enjoyed his class very much.
Awesome teacher. Hilarious, truly does try to help you learn and think like a computer scientist.
Excellent.
Amazing professor. VERY TOUGH CLASS.
He is easily the best teacher I've ever had. He presents interesting but easy to understand examples. He intentionally appears as very mean at times but it is just an illusion to keep the class interesting and everyone on their toes. Never had a dull moment in the class.
