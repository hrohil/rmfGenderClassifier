Amazing Professor
Best prof ever. Period.
One of the best professors I've had in Claremont. Very energetic and clearly excited about the material, which translates into great lectures. Available by email nearly 24/7.
She is awesome. Very excited and knowledgeable about CS things. She also brings in many examples from her own current work in the field.
Very nice and easygoing. The class had a decent amount of work, but that's not her fault, more the nature of the course. Quite helpful outside of class. Overall, no major complaints, a good and enjoyable professor, but nothing amazing.
