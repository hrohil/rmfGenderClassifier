I was so hyped for his classes since they're my focus, but it was such a let down. No hands-on work, or hands-on anything for that matter. Just listening to a quiet professor read off of links/powerpoints/textbooks he's hoarded over the past years, and that's about it. He's nice and helps where he can, but I've never been more bored about my major.
I have had him in 3351, 3360 and I am currently taking him right now, I enjoy the class and the teacher is amazing.  The class is hard but seems easy when you take his test.  I would suggest any MIS major to take his class since he really does care about the students
great teacher and I enjoyed the class, got 2 A's which made it fun and easy to me.  His test were hard but you can easily get an A on the test
ive had many classes with him. good professor since he actually tries to teach.
Dr. Durrett is the best!!!!
