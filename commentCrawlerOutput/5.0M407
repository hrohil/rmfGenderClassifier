He is an inspirational teacher. Even more helpful if you go to his office hour. He always tries to do his best to explain complicated concepts.
Professor Lu is absolutely amazing  a true gem at Emory! He's kind, caring, and accessible to students. He listens to student feedback and is willing to be flexible in terms of assignments and projects. His lectures are interactive and interesting and make you want to show up to class.
It was an extremely interesting class. I would take it again if I were allowed. It was apparent that he was passionate about computer science. However, sometimes he got excited about the topic and went too deep into concepts.
He is just amazing. He explains concepts very clearly and gives you a lot of hints to his homework assignments. The assignments are really hard, but they are practical problems. He tries to combine the problems in computer science with those in the real life. His exams are really hard, but he is not a tough grader. You will be fine if studying hard
Professor Lu is amazing! His assignments were pretty advanced and time consuming, but I learned a lot and my coding skills have improved significantly. Plus, if you're confused, he is always willing to work with you until you completely understand it. Amazing professor, hope I can have him again in the future!!
Best professor that I know of in the CS department. Was not too difficult to get an A, but learned a lot. He explains concepts very clearly and assigns relevant projects to apply what we learned such as a web crawler, map quest app for a shortest route algorithm, and a chess AI just to name a few.
