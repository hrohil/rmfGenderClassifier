Obviously, like any MIT professor, he 'knows his stuff', he teaches at the top technical institute in the world. Here's a more helpful comment: don't expect to understand what he talks about in lecture unless you've had ample prior exposure to computation systems (i.e., not just building a computer and being a 1337 h4ck3r). You'll have work a lot.
Fun class! Take it. Do it!
Very intelligent. Sort of arrogant, but he knows his material very well.
