I enjoyed taking this class mostly because of the subject material but I thought the lectures were a little hard to follow and boring. However she is ridiculously smart, really accessible outside of lectures, and definitely wants you to succeed.
I took Intro to Computer Science with Professor Newhall.  Full disclosure: I took the course Credit/No Credit (Pass/Fail) because I am very, very bad at CS.   The class had a steep learning curve, required lots of lecture attention, and labs eventually took up most of my work hours.  Tia has very clear criteria and wants to see you succeed.
Tia is very knowledgeable and helpful outside of class, although her in-class lectures are quite repetitive and boring. Couldn't help but fall asleep many times. She has the best attitude though and I really learned a lot of important systems concepts. Lab assignments are quite challenging and require a lot of resourcefulness and googling.
She teaches difficult classes and you better have an interest in the subject. She has all the answers and is more than helpful if you approach her. Great professor if you're an active learner. I think I ended up taking all classes she was teaching around then. Some of the most useful stuff I learned in college came from her classes

The lectures were less than thrilling but usually straightforward and fairly easy to understand.  I thought the assignements for this class were pretty fun.
