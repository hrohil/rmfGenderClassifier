I recommend you should not take the course because the class is boring and has a lot of homework. The feedback of your homework and project is not timely too.
This course is pretty useful if you plan to do something about natural language processing. Moreover, the professor also gave supplement knowledge about machine learning and human-computer interaction. One thing needs to be mentioned is that you need to know at least one programming language because the students would have some coding homework.
You can definitely get an A going through the motions and completing the assignments, but really paying attention will have you learning a lot. I learned a lot from his CS5604 course, more than I have from a course in awhile. Some programming assignments were time consuming, but he will work with the class if it seems to difficult.
Info Storage &amp; Retrieval Two thirds of students dropped the class within the first month. Wish I had dropped too. Lots of homework, hard project, unexpected midterm questions. Won't learn much after week 3 (research paper oriented). Tough grader, does not return graded papers, you won't know why you got a bad grade, if you ask he won't be gracious.
