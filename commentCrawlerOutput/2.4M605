focus on the material provided and lectures
Sensitive and emotional. He barely explain the thing he was teaching thoroughly and clearly. Reading textbook is the only cure to understand the course. Sometimes errors could be found in his homework solutions, which can be misleading. In such case, what you get from textbook may not fit for what is expected in his exam, then you will fail.
Good professor, but I think this is his last semester that he'll be teaching. Really cares if you do or don't understand material
Need a boring lecture? Noe is the G.O.A.T. when your looking for this. Unless you have an old test good luck figuring out what'll be on the test. He'all just tell you what chapters to look over. Basically understand and know everything or fail. All the homework answers are in the PowerPoints though, so good luck and I hope you pass.
Dr. Lopez clearly tells you what he expects on tests. You will revisit these computer architecture topics when you take operating systems so, despite what people think, his class is rather valuable. Aside from all this, he is ALWAYS available in his office and is more than willing to help you.
Although some people do not like him, he clearly has enthusiasm for his job. One of those professors that's way overqualified to be teaching a low level assembly course but he puts his effort into making sure learn. Just don't make fun of the way he talks, it's a little funny.
He teaches assembly and classes concerning computer architecture which most students have a preconceived disliking for. However, Dr. Lopez works really well with students who actually haveshow an interest for the material. Very, very good at understanding your questions and giving good, detailed answers. ALWAYS available in his office.
Senile professor and useless course. Assembly is akin to Latin in terms of usefulness in my career, and it's a wonder it is still required. I would not recommend this professor one bit, but our CS department is poor, so we are stuck retaking his course. Bummer.
I only take his class so I can stare into his eyes longingly
