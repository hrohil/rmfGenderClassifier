i agree with the comment that said taking his tests were fun! Yes the Homeworks were WAY too hard but if you go to disc the TA gives you the answers. a lot of my friends had to take pic 10a too and they had the same homeworks with different professors so i think that comes from the department. he posts many of his old exams online study those!
class is ridiculously demanding be prepared to spend 15 hours on hw everyweek.He's also inconsistent with direction,one day he tells you this way the next day he tells you another.He's only nice to smart students and cold to the rest.Doesn't help you much on the hard hw.
I killed my self in his class, I used to work on the homeworks that each used to take me 25 to 30 hours. I ended up receiving a C+ with 79.7. I deserve a B or a B- at least! don't take him unless you have enough time to work on the homework at least 30 hours every week.
He is a nic guy, but you wont learn any thing, he spends the class time with teaching useless materials. the homeworks worth 40% of the grade and they are really hard, at leat 20 hours for each of them. exams are hard. again I should say, the homwworks are really hard, the whole week you have to work on the homework.
One of the best professors at UCLA, and probably my favorite teacher ever.  He explains things very well and I found I learned a lot from this class.  I actually ENJOYED taking his exams.  How crazy is that?  If you want a good experience, take professor Wittman!
This guy is great, take him if you have the choice.  He's so funny and he's my favorite teacher ever at UCLA.
Awesome teacher, perhaps a bit to oriented on LOTR. Really funny, makes the subject interesting and keeps lectures humorous. Wish I could take 10B with him.
Very helpful teacher. His tests are fair but not too hard. His homework assignments are good and his lectures are interesting.
