Not very talkative.  Goes over PowerPoint, answers questions, assigns lab each class, then you can leave when done.  Easy as that.
Jacobs is a retired Navy Captain and will remind you of that every chance he gets.  Do NOT wear a hat to class or he'll call you out.  Work is done in class from text.  Gruff, short and very stiff.  SQL is pretty basic stuff, but he makes it harder with his teaching style. Grades consist of 3 exams.  Nothing else, even attendence, is required.
