I took the class. Was pretty easy. Test came straight from the notes. No surprises. HW was not time consuming either. He does have a thick accent but he is very helpful when you ask him questions. He does not take attendance so a lot of people never showed up besides test day.
I really like this guy. His accent is a bit hard to understand, but he gives fair assignments and tests. He responds to emails and is very helpful. People would probably do much better if they listened to him instead of playing Warcraft/surfing FB all day. Yea, notes are posted online, but going over them without paying attention in class = foolish
He is such a horrible lecturer..I mean..I finally understand why Emory is rated so low in the field of computer science. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!
