Demands respect but does nothing to earn it.
He's in my 'top 2 worst professors' list.  I'm not even sure if he understands what he's teaching.
Always late to class, fairly entertaining lectures of otherwise boring material.  Tests are relatively easy.  Programming Assignments aren't difficult, but can be time consuming.  He gives requirements specifications for the assignments and project, but more often than not, they are wrong or he only wants it done one particular way.  DISORGANIZED.
If on the final you get an A you get an A, otherwise the regular way of grading applies. Gives you vague specifications on programs but then expects you to have it done exactly the way he want's it in short amount of time. He's not impossible to please but it's hard finding out what he wants exactly. For tests memorize note codes and what they do.
Sorry about I good at programming**** his test a hard the projects a ridiculous in the time he gives you. Best of luck try to get help from someone who has passed the class
Entertaining class, but at cost of relatively steep incline in level of difficulty. Assumes too much, often rude, but you'll find yourself liking him alot when grades aren't involved. A on final gives an A in class, pretty easy.
Very amusing teacher...class was always fun to go to. He does kick things off fast and can be rude if things aren't going well, but the class is easy. if your prog compiles and doesn't work, you get a 50. If you miss a question on the test, he only takes off half so long as you wrote something.
definently a good guy im sure, but he was late to meetings, acts as if you're stupid.  he is helpful to a point though and allows you to pass the final with an a, you get an a, no matter what your other grades were
Teaches the class as though it were a graduate-level class, when in fact it is only the third programming class for most of the students. Has a tendency to make the material highly abstract, and does not bother actually teaching the programing language.
Maybe a good teacher for an AI course(I wouldn't know), He teaches freshman C just like he would a graduate class. Everyone's confused, and he won't explain the assignments. The programs are hard enough for C experts, how are freshmen supposed to do them&amp;
Teaches his graduate AI course very well.  Clearly enjoys the subject matter more than most (evolutionary computation).  If you are intelligent and remotely interested in the material, he is great.  Laziness &amp; stupidity will hurt your cause, though.
AI is a tough class and they're thinking of making it not required anymore. anywho, Dozier is a great human being with strong faith and his style of teaching forces you to think.
I had Dozier for three different classes: C, UML, and AI. He teaches some hard stuff, and might not explain it well in class, but he'll definitely take time outside of class to help you out. He is a great human being.
Dozier is a good teacher, but can be difficult. He has a tendency to make students feel dumb. It seems intentional, but I'm not really sure.
nah, dozier is cool.  he's a good teacher.
UML class which is a easy class but Dr Dozier don't know how to teach and he is being an ass in the class ! so don't take him !!!!
