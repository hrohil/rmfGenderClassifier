Nothing special about her. I admire her for trying her best, but her lectures aren't the clearest and I don't understand fully when she teaches. I end up doing most of my learning in lab. The lectures are a bit dull too.
I absolutely loved Orit's lectures. She always answers students' questions as she goes, and is really helpful in office hours too.
