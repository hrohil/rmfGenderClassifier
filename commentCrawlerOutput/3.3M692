Though he spent much time on lecturing and leaves us a limited time on the class activities, he does not present the concept in a clear and organized way.
He explains things very clearly. He has a lot of office hours and is very willing to answer any questions for you outside of class.
Fair grader and understanding to students specific obstacles, but has an awkward sense of humor and often gives quite unorganized lectures. You will do fine in the class if you turn in your work.
He knows his stuff and is great at answering questions, he just doesn't do the best job making the material clear to begin with. You really need to ask questions and go to office hours to understand the concepts fully. Also spends too much time on lecture, not enough in class activity time
Comprehensive lectures. Spends approx. 30 min(usually goes over) to explain concepts of the day, based on the reading. Uses the whiteboard to visualise concepts &amp; helpful analogies to explain concepts. 2-3 readings/reading responses per week, daily activities. 2 midterm exams %1 final. Great teacher. Accessible, friendly, funny. Drinks Mountain Dew
I would not recommend taking a class with this professor. The homework assignments were brutally difficult, the tests were confusingly graded, and overall the expectations of the course were very unclear. Daniel himself is also a terrible lecturer, and a great portion of in-class time was devoted to him reading off of his lazy PowerPoints.
