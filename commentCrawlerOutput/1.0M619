Worst instructor ever. Yes you really can't expect a man come out of a giant corporation to be easy-going and laid back, but Chien is just go too far. He is downright aloof, laugh at his students, and make everybody scare of him. Just waste one semester there.
Another reviewer called Chien apathetic towards his students, this is an understatement: he is downright disdainful.  Many is the time when a disheveled student (this is the University of Chicago) would ask a question and he would smirk and ignore the question.  I felt uncomfortable every minute I was in this class.
Chien is downright apathetic towards his students.  Several times students in our class would reach out for help (ostensibly in earnest) through our class discussion forum and when he would respond, his responses rarely answered the question and worse, were condescending, callous, and aloof.  If you value your time and self-esteem, avoid him.
Taking this class is a waste of time: reading Patterson and Hennessy on your own and doing the exercises in the book will give you the same education while costing about two orders of magnitude less money.
