great professor but very hard.
At first I had a negative opinion about his way of teaching. I thought the programming projects were extremely hard, but if you go to his office hours, he will help you out. By the end of the semester I felt more confident with my programming skills. Tough class and professor, but definitely worth it!!
Great guy, quiz in every class about what we learned in the previous class. Always there to help, always trying to give extra credit. The projects, homework assignments and lab were fun.
Every class you will have a quiz worth 4 points covering the material from the day before, make sure to study. Next you will have note and a lecture, following this pattern the entire semester. If you have any questions, he is MORE than willing to help. Also, study the quizzes and his notes and the test should be easy enough.
Amazing Professor! One of the best i've had, really cares about his students and not just teaching us the subject but how to learn in general. Would DEFINITELY take again!
DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES! Took the class for my Q and got a C, which for any other class would have indicated that I got it. Bogaerts decided that I didn't do well enough, even though I consistently went to his office hours, and didn't give me the Q. He goes through the material very quickly, so you barely have any time to understand it.
