The materials and homework will get harder and harder, sometimes it's really difficult and time-consuming to finish. She teaches OK so that you can learn a lot, but not an easy grader.
Quite good at teaching the material and analyzing examples. She is not easy, you will have to put in the work to understand and do the homeworks which gets quite challenging towards the end. Yet, she really teaches well and you will learn a lot even though your grade might not be the best.
Good class, but material is just hard by it's nature.  Need to understand and think about material - can't just memorize.  Go get help when needed.  Don't get behind.
