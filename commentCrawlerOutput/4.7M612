It's an easy class, but I didn't feel like I learned much over the semester. Classes consist of just reading powerpoints he posts online with the occasional example. Required a lot of self teaching.
Great Professor
Awesome professor. If you don't understand any concept then just go to his office and he will teach you anything and everything he knows - Just Ask
He is an amazing professor who cares for his students and he is accessible outside the class. Very fun to get along with and the lectures are amazing. very helpful
Best CS professor I have had in a while. He is new to the university but he really knows his stuff. He may not have everything organized yet, but he made things as simple as he could.
I think he's a new professor, but that shouldn't be held against him. He genuinely cares for his students, and is pretty clear with what he expects you to know on the tests. Programming isn't easy for me, but I came away with an A,
