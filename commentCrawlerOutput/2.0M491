This course is extremely hard with too much mathematics. The professor is tough. His score average has been 55% for years.
Cao's teaching style is awful.  His examples are either oversimplified, overcomplicated, or nonexistant. His accent makes him very difficult to understand during lecture, and his explanations are more confusing than helpful. The class average for the final this semester was a 55%. Grading is unfair and many test questions are deceptive by design.
