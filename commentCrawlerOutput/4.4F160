Lauren is a thoughtful and extremely helpful professor. However, her assignments and quizzes are on the easy side, and not as challenging as they could potentially be. Plenty of opportunity for extra credit, and work is graded promptly and unambiguously.
Very good at teaching and generous with extra credit. (at Macalester College). Accessible outside of class and very helpful. Quizzes are too easy.
nice professor but too easy, this class was my only "A" in a Carleton cs course
Lauren was great: clear, engaging lectures with hands-on components, challenging assignments, fair tests and grading. I was very impressed by her handing out mid-term feedback forms and preparing a presentation that included every comment she received from us. My only complaint: reading sometimes didn't sync with lecture. Syllabus note: HW 35%.
