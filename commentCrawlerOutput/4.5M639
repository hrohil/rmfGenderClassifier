the sweetest guy. Almost every assignment was a group project.
He talks to the whiteboard but he's a good prof.
A really caring professor, always willing to help. Lectures can become dry, but not too bad. Group projects abound. Almost every non-exam/quiz assignment is done with a partner, which will almost certainly feel unbearable at some point if you feel that you're above average at CS. All around, a solid class and professor, you will learn a lot.
It's hard not to like Titus. He's a very smart, kind man. He struggled a bit with pacing the data structures class, but I'm sure he'll improve on structuring classes once he has a few more terms at Carleton under his belt.
