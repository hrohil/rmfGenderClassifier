Take a class with Takis. He is such a wonderful person and he really strives to get to know his students. If you are lucky, try to take a lab with Stella. She is amazing and so sweet. Both profs aim to really get to know their students beyond the classroom and make CS an accessable field for anyone who is willing to put in the time. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
Takis is really great! I think most importantly, I have nothing to complain about after having taken the course, so I won't. The course was very well organized, and you could tell that the professor knew what he was talking about, he cared for the students, and was eager to make sure that the concepts treated were accessible.
Very nice and approachable.  He likes to make corny jokes in class and liven up the class as much as possible, but as you can probably imagine, CS lectures are pretty dry.  I would absolutely recommend him as a prof.  Regardless of which prof you have, exams are tough but you can make up for poor exams by acing HW, which takes effort but doable
