class is pretty hard.  test your code very thoroughly before you submit it.  he'll test nearly every scenario to try and break it, and you'll end up losing way more points than you think you will
Baruah knows his stuff and is fairly clear about what you need to know for the 4 mid-terms. The exams were very challenging &amp; required applied knowledge of the material. He was very helpful &amp; much less intimidating in office hours. Definitely would recommend going to class, reading the book, doing practice problems, &amp; starting assignments early.
He's a good professor. He explains things very clearly. The workload is small compared to other CS classes.
I will admit, the tests are hard. But I learned much more than the other section. During my year, the class was curved using a formula based upon how you did compared to the rest of the class. Despite this difficulty, I learned a great deal from the class. Go to class. Memorize his slides and do practice problems from the book. You will succeed.
One of the best CS professors I've had at UNC (of the 4 I've had thus far). Knows his stuff and conveys the information well. Gives good notes, assignments and exams are manageable. Is more concerned about what you learn rather than grades and such (I love profs like that). Some think he's boring, but I disagree completely. Would highly recommend.
Teaches at a high level and understands material, but very unhelpful outside of class and not very approachable.  Included test material that was not covered at all without warning (set math, etc. on first test - not hard but if you haven't used it in awhile and lose test points for it, pretty stupid).  Very harsh grader.
This guy is awesome, though he demands a good amount from his students.  The class is interesting, and he teaches in a way that makes the material pretty easy.  If you want to learn a lot, this is your man.
