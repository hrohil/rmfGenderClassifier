No specific text book. Go to class. Refer handouts by professor. Complete assignments. Learn by googling topics that are not clear from handouts.
I took Cloud Computing under Judy - The course content is good - Overall teaching was not impressive - Grading system is very easy
Awesome subject. Professional projects. Nice Prof.
This is probably the worst class I have taken at IU. The book is outdated, the lectures are impossible to follow (mandatory attendance), and the assignments are not interesting. This class is ridiculously easy though. I would not recommend taking this class to anyone.
So...I don't want to be harsh here because I think Prof. Qiu is probably very intelligent and a great research professor. But this class had probably the lowest learning-to-information ratio of any class I have ever taken in any subject. Period. Lots of concepts thrown at you; let's hope they stick to the wall. Not difficult but frustrating anyway.
Judy Qiu is a very nice person, but her teaching leaves a lot to be desired.  The assignments are very difficult, but her lectures do not prepare you for them at all. This was my least favorite Computer Science class I've taken at IU.  Everything is extremely confusing and unclear in this class.
Prof. Judy Qiu taught us this course in the Fall of 2012. She is an incredible teacher. She really knows her subject. Quite helpful. Exams and assignments are tough and requires deep thinking. Prof. also has knowledge outside usual course content. Class participation and project involvement matters. If you are lazy, you won't like this course.
Judy is a very nice person, but teaching just isn't her strong suit.  Lectures were a confusing mess and assignments were worse.  Her explanation of topics was very shallow, yet assignments required very deep understanding the concepts.  On the bright side, she did respond to email and answer questions during one-on-one meetings
Instructor is great one on one but was lost in the larger section required to teach by the university(60 people in a lab!). The requirements and expectations of the class were often confusing and it was harder to figure out how to turn in the homework then it was to do the homework.
