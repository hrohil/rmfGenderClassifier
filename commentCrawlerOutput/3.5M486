Great and knowledgable professor.
Excellent professor
Excellent professor and very helpful.
I had Dr. Back several years ago, and I don't feel his overall quality rating here is fair. Yes, the course is difficult, but operating systems are difficult. He was *very* accesible and helpful. People might be turned off by his blunt personality, but if you ask him any question, he will answer it calmly and patiently -- and correctly.
Back is incredibly arrogant and mean spirited and his lecturing skills are non-existent. His courses are basically impossible and at the end you feel like you know less than you did when you started the course. The only positive things about Back is that he is insanely knowledgeable and easily accessible.
Great Professor!  Very helpful!
3204 is the notorious class for the CS dept at VT.  Back does a good job of presenting the material in the form of slides. Going to class is essentially pointless tho, as he's incomprehensible as a speaker. The combination of his accent and very low volume make him difficult to hear.  He really knows his material, and is always available to help.
