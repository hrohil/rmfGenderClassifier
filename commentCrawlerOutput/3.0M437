Necaise is Awesome!
I think Rance is the most knowledgeable professor in the department.  His lectures are well planned, well thought-out and interesting if you like the material.  His assignments always make sense and are always possible.  If you have to take a CSCI class above 112, make sure it's with Necaise.
Professor Necaise is the man, plain and simple...
I was told to take CS 111 because I have a good amount of experience with computers. This was a mistake. It turns out I could have learned a lot in 101 and still gotten an easy A, but now I'm stuck in 111 (it's all about Java) and am struggling to get a B. It is very hard to get help from Necaise; he acts like you already know the material.
Prof. Necaise is a great Professor if you really like computer science and know your stuff. You can catch him at the Palms on most weekends...
PROFESSOR NECAISE IS THE BEST!!
