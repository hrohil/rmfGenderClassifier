Some of the grades I received were suspect, but he was always open to talking through it. A very funny professor if you listen to him lecture. Quiz/exam questions sometimes unclear, but he is willing to explain what he wants if you ask during the quiz.
Really easy class. Sometimes the quizzes are hard but he'll curve them. His lectures are occasionally boring but other than that he's an excellent professor. Also very nice guy.
Professor Ghosh is extremely caring about his students and will go to great lengths to help as many people as he can, even if that means helping outside of class and his office hours. He will always make time and try his best to make sure his students understand the material.
Nice guy
Great teacher and cares a lot about his students
Nice person and caring teacher, but not great at writing tests clearly
He is a very hardworking teacher. He is very caring and I can feel that. However, sometimes his lectures can get a bit hard to understand.
