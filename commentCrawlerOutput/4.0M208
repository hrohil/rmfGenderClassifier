great prof. would recommend
Extremely knowledgeable in his field. Always very helpful in class and outside of class.
Excellent professor. Hard grader and a challenging course (CIS320) but I learned a lot in a very short amount of time
Not just a terrible prof, a horrible person too.  Condescending, insulting, and actually told one of my friends in the class that he should reconsider being a PhD student at Penn if he was struggling with Khanna's class.  And the PhD student was just taking the class because he thought it would help him with research--he was an EE PhD.
