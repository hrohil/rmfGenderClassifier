Very unclear to what you need to know before the labs and hard to follow during lectures
If you go to class, you will do well. I got a 3.0 but I rarely showed up and if I did, I wasn't taking notes or paying attention.   All homework answers are on chegg, which  bit me in the ass later on.    Professor Weng is hard to understand sometimes and can be pretty boring at others but if you stick with it and put in the work you will do well.
Explained the class material pretty well. The material is tough and therefore many students blame him for their own failings.
Wrote his own book for you to use, half of his work is incorrect.  Homework's he states is just a minor modification of his example, ends up being completely different and 10x more complex.  Seems as if none of his research and examples even work.  Very bad professor, forces students to correct his book for his own benefit without credit given.
