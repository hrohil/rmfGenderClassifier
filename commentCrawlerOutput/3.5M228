Spike is a very helpful, attentive professor. When he sees confusion in the classroom, he stops lecturing and addresses our questions, not moving on until he's certain we understand. Class can move a bit slowly, but the material was all the more clear for that reason. He was also very approachable and friendly.
He's such a nice guy! He really takes a lot of pain for his classes
John Hughes is self centered and a horrible teacher. His lectures are often put on hold while he tries (and usually fails) to figure something out. His grading is sporadic and often yields unfair results. Although i got an A some of my friends got many points taken off for silly mistakes when they clearly understood the concepts.
