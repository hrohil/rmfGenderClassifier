I really enjoyed the class &amp; the professor.  I liked his real world stories and examples about hacking and hackers.  The only draw back to the class was for me was other students.  Half of the students seem to not belong in a class of this level. They would hold up the rest of us while Mr. Mosley would have to explain things they should know.
