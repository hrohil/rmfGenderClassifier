Layla is one of our best. Her lectures are thorough, well-paced, and diligently prepared, with frequent examples. Her exams are unambiguous and fair (and sometimes include food). She assigns less homework around exams and breaks. In office hours, Layla listens carefully and then supplies the hint that you need to get un-stuck. In sum, a true 5/5.
I took intro without any experience in CS and found it to be challenging, but definitely not impossible with Layla. Her lectures are clear and complement the readings well. The bulk of the material is taught through HW, which is done with partners and generally takes quite a while. Some people found difficulty with this but Layla is there to help.
Not very accessible outside class. She wasn't very helpful during office hours anyway. Was a harsh grader on mistakes that she considered "common." Kept the class interesting though as she's always happy to be teaching.
DS is the dept's hardest class and Layla made it more approachable with reasonable HW that counts for 40% of your grade (even though it's 80% of the work in the class). There was a huge disconnect between HW and tests with tests being way too conceptual and mathy yet counting for 55% of your grade and dragging down my grade as a result. Really nice
Layla's a really good prof. The material by nature was difficult but Layla made it extremely approachable. Highly recommend!
Nothing to say about this prof other than this fact: She took almost half of our final project points off solely because a. we didn't name our class/method names the way she likes; b. she could't easily understand what our methods are doing(project works perfectly); c. Our loops are not "clean" enough(she stated before she cares more if it works)
Layla is a pretty new teacher, having arrived at carleton in 2015, but she is doing a great job. Her lectures are pretty clear, and she is very organized and fair. Very accessible outside class, and she likes to get to know the class, knowing everyones names by the second day. in Math of CS, problems sets were tough, but not too bad. average grader
Layla's was one of my best coding experiences at Carleton but she's difficult and I had more than a few issues with the graders for the class but that's not her fault; she did a good job of remedying this issue.
Layla's new at teaching, and you can tell she's working really hard to improve which I appreciate a lot. Very receptive to feedback and helpful in office hours. Only major complain is that the projects and problem sets were often very open ended, which would be great if there wasn't such strict grading criteria. Lectures were engaging and fun.
