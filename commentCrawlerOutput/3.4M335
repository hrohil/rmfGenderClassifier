Meh. I really loved computer science coming into this class, less so coming out of it. Just reads from the powerpoint.
Best proof I ever had.  I learned garbage collection and memory allocation even though he taught the course in java.  It made the transition to c and c++ much easier and helped me later on in my college career.
Prof. Aaron is a great professor: clear, strives to be helpful, and has a sense of humor. Some people get wierded out by his unusual style of classroom interactions, but he's great fun and extremely informative.
Knows what he's doing, always willing to help, does a very good job imparting the material, and tries his hardest to do everything in a manner that is best for students. 5/5

Very disappointed in the course and in the professor. Professor tried too hard to be polite. You know what I mean if you've taken the course or if you take the course in the future.
Teaches the material well, with excellent power points.  Short workload.  Very fair grader.  Invites questions and tries to help, but instead embarrasses the asker thoroughly and speaks condescendingly.  Refuses to answer questions which don't fit into his greater class plan.  You'll have no choice, but try to avoid: frustration awaits.
