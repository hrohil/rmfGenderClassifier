She is very passionate in her class. But her homework is never easy. High time-commitment.
She's got a lot of heart and is extremely well qualified, but her lecture ability isn't superb. She gets caught up in details a lot and doesn't give students a lot of slack. The homework can be brutal at times. I've taken multiple classes with her and not a single one would I describe as easy or low time commitment.
I'm really looking forward to the development of the CS department with Prof. Davis in charge -- she's a good professor, willing to negotiate if homework's too long, and helpful outside of class. Weekly project that's supposed to take  3-5hrs and a textbook reading per class.
