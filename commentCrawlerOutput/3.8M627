Dr. Woo is an excellent lecturer, he is clear in his instructions for assignments and is a fair grader.  Real world case studies are what I am interested in and Dr. Woo delivers these. Some of the discussions really made me think about my organization processes.   The guest speakers were excellent.
Dr. Woo was understanding and considerate. He was generally very positive. The course did seem more catered to a business-like perspective and as the other comment said, it may not be optimal for a rigorous understanding of networking.
As a working professional, I appreciated that Dr. Woo valued our time.  He presented useful material in an interesting and challenging manner. He encouraged further research, but did not make the class unnecessarily cumbersome. He was accessible and prompt in returning voice and emails. The material presented was informative and practical.
If u want 2 learn networking -avoid! Subject taught like a business college class - write papers 'why is networking important' If u write technical paper he literally said "this paper is to technical." If u want 2 pass without sweat, just write some BS and submit it in time. Northwestern really degraded. This guy is a director and does not care
