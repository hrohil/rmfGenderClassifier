Prof. Zagrodzki is great, he cares about his students and their success. He is easy to talk to outside of class and is a genuinely nice guy. His lecture was at 8 a.m. and can feel boring at times, and sometimes I didn't find his slides very helpful, but he seems to do everything he can to help his students including answering their questions online
Professor Zagrodzki is a really good teacher. He really makes an effort to teach students the concepts instead of just straight coding. So far, he is my favorite computer science. The only two problems I've had are that sometimes his lectures are a little messy and he goes a little too quick. If you attend class everyday, you should be fine.
His lecture slides are not very helpful for learning what is necessary in the class. That is very clear because about a quarter of the students come to lecture. I honestly would of done just as well if I had just taught myself the material.
Can't give too much overly positive or negative feedback here. Zagrodski does an ok job teaching what's going to be needed for upcoming assignments, but that said it isn't always the easiest to follow, and the lectures aren't super engaging. He seems to be invested in his students' success and the assignments in 1320 aren't excessively difficult.
He skipped through lecture slides very quickly and never seemed to cover material that was relevant to the course work. He is not a very engaging professor and he treated students like they already had experience in what he was teaching, when that wasn't the case for everyone. The example code was nice, but he skimmed over it too fast to be helpful
I was not a fan of professor Zagrodzki. It felt like we did not use Matlab in the way it was made to be used. Lecture is difficult to sit through, as he has a very monotone voice that is good at putting people to sleep. He skipped through the slides very quickly. If you have to take this class with him, it is very helpful to read the book.
Very boring lecture, the course work takes a lot of time, but at least the assignments are a bigger grade for the class than usual.
Love this beautiful man
Zagrodzki has been a great professor so far, he is very quick to answering questions via Piazza. He does say 'um' quite often in lecture, but it's not a huge deal. He's made it very clear that if you do all the homework and labs, you'll find success.
