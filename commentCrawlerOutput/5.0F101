This class was an easy A. It's clear that she gets frustrated with those who refuse to put in that minimal amount of effort, but that just means that if you do she will respect you for it and appreciate it (esp. if you participate during lectures). Relies on TAs for a lot, but always easy to reach. Knows her stuff, and explains things very clearly.
