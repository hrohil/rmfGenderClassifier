Although you can learn lots of useful things, this course requires too much from you and the amount of time and effort you put on this course wouldn't properly be valued at the end.
This course takes me so much time and effort - which she do not value at all. You will get a very low score based on your hard work. Exams are hard, projects are hard, I think many students will receive a C even they tried their best, not joking.
Nazli is super smart and knowledgeable and she really wants to help you learn. Very willing to answer any questions in class and office hours. Tests were all very straightforward too; she doesn't try to trick you or anything. It's a lot of work but totally worth it!
Nazli made it very clear that she had no interest in teaching our class. She rarely held office hours and made no effort to get to know studentsI doubt she knew a single persons name. Her lectures consist of reading off a slideshow. Not interesting and did not learn much from them. Most of my learning was done through the TAs who are mostly good.
Nazli is a very good professor and she cares about her students. Her classes usually requires a lot of work in comparison with other classes as you usually have to do 3 project and 2 exams. But you learn a lot from her classes both regarding the concepts and their implementation in practice. Her slides are a bit outdated and should be renewed.
Nazli is a phenomenal professor that really cares about her students.  Her classes are extraordinarily hard, but as an undergraduate, you will walk away knowing many things that students at the top schools don't understand.  Data Mining, text mining, and IR are huge topics, and you will learn a ton from her classes.  Work hard, and it'll pay off.
Nazli cares a lot about her students and her data mining class will single-handily set you up for a career.   The material is hand-picked to teach you the most about data mining in the span of a semester. Approachable during (and out of) office hours and willingly offers additional resources to her students.
Lectures were scattered, unorganized, unhelpful. She teaches from PPTs based on the textbook but they are completely out of order and unhelpful when reviewing after. 2 short hw assignments, then a big group project, then literally no hw review on the material after the midterm. She's completely unwilling to help out of class, and tests are hard.
Difficult to understand, unclear grading, tough projects for a 200 level.  Also not curved. Avoid if possible.
