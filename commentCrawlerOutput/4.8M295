First day of class, Misha told us to be prepared for a lot of work, and he wasn't wrong, it's a fair amount of programming. There's a good amount of math background, but you're not explicitly tested on it. He lets you choose what to implement on the projects so long as you hit 30 points, so you choose what excites you.
Very supportive
Very nice professor.He helps a lot..he is an expert in his field and has very solid math background which can help you..
 He is laid back..if you work you will go fine...otherwise i dont know:)
He is a very good teacher. The homeworks are A LOT of work, though. It is a fun class, and Misha keeps it interesting.
A lot of work but the prof is fun and very laid back.  Definatly start the projects early.  You don't really have to come to class to do the homework since the notes are all posted, but it's hard to do well on the test without his explanations in class.  One of my favorite CS profs to date.
