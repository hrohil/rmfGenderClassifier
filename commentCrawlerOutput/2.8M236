A very mean prof, and you need to be careful about everything.
Useless class. Save yourself some time and learn everything you need about ML from online lectures.
Well-prepared lectures, project is where the most interesting to do while learning machine learning models.
ML is a very interesting subject. The lectures are well-organized and well-delivered. The exams can be a bit challenging. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.
The lecture is overall OK. Pronunciation is clear. He is a strict and rigid. He don't  even allow a different form of answer in the homework.
The lectures are easy to follow. Not much using textbook. 3 Homework requires both programming (MATLAB) and theory questions. The project is fun and I learning a lot via doing it which is my own proposed problem using machine learning models.
Avoid if possible. The lecture is not well prepared and you will find he always use the word 'exactly' to answer your questions.
prepare your excuse to skip the class. Boring....
