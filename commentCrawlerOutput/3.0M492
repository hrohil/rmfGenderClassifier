I took iOS with Balci. He knows his stuff very well and his tests are easy but he will screw u up on the final proj (25%). You will be graded solely on whether he likes ur app or not. Worst of all, he changes his mind every day on what he told you to do. I had 105% (+extra credit) average and ended up with a C because he didn't like my final app
This prof relates his material well.  If you pay attention in class, he'll outline the tests pretty much word-for-word.  Exams are made up exactly from quiz problems.  His course taught me a lot of "buzz words" that while not being particularly useful, have assisted in making me look better in job interviews.  Talks lots about the DoD.
