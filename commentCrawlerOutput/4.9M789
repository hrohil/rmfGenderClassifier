LOVE Nathan. His way of teaching didn't deter me from being a CS major at all. He's very good at explaining things and getting you to conceptualize. He doesnt play though, put up your phones in class and don't submit a late assignment.
He's an awesome professor who is unfortunately leaving us! :(  I had him for my first ever Computer Science class and he gave me hope and encouragement a lot of times when I felt like giving up. Now I'm a potential Computer Science major, because he gave me the push to realize my full potential!
He's very helpful and hard-working. Very intelligent too. Its bad that he'll not be teaching here anymore :(
nathan is great!
Great guy and teaching method. Reviews a lot from reading material so you get the chance for it to really sink in. Approachable by all people both with a passion in CS and others meeting requirements.
