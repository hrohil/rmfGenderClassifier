Great teacher but very tough grader and hard quizzes/test. He's a newer teacher so he does not know how to balance how hard the quizzes and test are with the limited time he gives as well.
He goes really slow in his class that it's super annoying. Those quizzes are easy, but because he goes too slow that some how you will miss out something during the class. I wish he goes faster in class and then give us some work for the remaining time so we can actually practice instead of listening to him. Conclusion: He goes very slow.
Chad is very knowledgeable and one of the best computer science professors at DePauw. He is passionate about what he teaches and will go above and beyond to explain it to you. He teaches well and expects a lot too. His exams are tough, but they are doable if you diligently practice what he teaches.
