Professor Maggs was a very enjoyable professor. His lectures were entertaining and he tried to incorporate more applicable, real-world information though occasionally he didn't know the slides super well as he didn't write them. Tests were very fair and off lectures/projects. The projects did take a solid amount of time, make sure to start early!
Maggs' graduate course on computer security was easier than almost all of my CS classes taken at Duke. Midterms were extremely easy, and we had 2 assignments that took maybe 10-20 hours each. The final was a group paper on basically anything we wanted related to computer security. He comes with good stories, and is generally lenient.
Very interesting class and Prof Maggs is great at explaining the material while also keeping classes fun. Lenient grading.
Dude is a total chiller. Founder and current VP of Security at Akamai. Often wears Hawaiian shirts.
Mid1: two questions were hard, others amazingly easy.Mid2: every question was easy.Final: pretty hard, but manageable. That said, the things you learn are hard. I've heard his curve is pretty good, though he doesn't specify it. He's really laid back and funny, but he doesn't use notes when he teaches so sometimes he gets lost during the lectures.
Bruce Maggs is amazing. Distributed Systems was the best class I've taken at Duke. For someone with so much experience in the space, he is really good at explaining it. He also chooses very interesting and relevant topics to teach. His stories about industry are also awesome.
Funny and keeps class entertaining. Homeworks are a bit challenging, but he is easily accessible at office hours. Tests and final were absurdly easy
