The best teacher you could ever have. Always happy to help. Very energetic and explains stuff well. His projects might take you some time but I really loved coding after taking Prof. McPherson Class
Pretty helpful and very nice
Really great guy, very helpful and accessible. I did not find him to be a particularly easy grader (which is good - this was a grad level course) but he was fair and only tested us on relevant material. You need to do the reading and listen to lectures to keep up. But if you get stuck, he'll bend over backwards to help.
Really great guy. His tests are fairly easy. There was only one project and it was easy. For the final test, he gives you the choice of either averaging the two tests' grades you got and use it for the final grade or you can take the final if you don't like your grade.
Easy class! The average was an A- in our class if that helps you. He was the best of the ECE 1574 professors. If you've programmed before, the lectures are boring, but the labs will be simple; if not, it's still not all that hard. You should do the study guides he gives you, they help for tests. The projects are easy too. No curve, but still good.

A fun teacher to have, quite affable and prone to developing project descriptions up until the day code is due. He has a good sense of humor and it probably models actual programming situations, and he makes concessions if he wasn't clear. Lectures are very easy to understand, but then again he tends to read off the slides.
A great guy all around, truly enjoyed his class. Things tested are taught in class and there isn't any 'BS.' He is very helpful not only inside the classroom but outside as well. Also is generally supportive when it comes to lateness, etc.
