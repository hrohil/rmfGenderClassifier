Brad Rosen is the kind of guy who you'd love as your professor and the kind of guy you'd want to be your best friend. His lectures catch your attention with witty jokes and comments throughout, and he always finds away to make sure you take something new with you everytime you leave class. Beware of some hard assignments, but overall great!
