was my TA, not prof. Bought real character to a boring and pointless class, and cared for each one of us outside class and made sure we learned. We all nominated him. He is a really smart guy, can sometimes fall off the radar, but a very nice guy. Wish him the best! Fond memories.
I am currently in his class on Deep Learning (taught at U. Chicago for the first time). It is hard to believe that he is a grad student teaching his first class, although this is an advanced class - because his lectures are so amazingly put together and absolutely clear. A brilliant guy, easily one of the best teachers I have ever had.
