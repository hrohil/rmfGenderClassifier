Charlie is a great teacher. If you don't quite understand the concept, go to his office hour. If you don't have much idea about your exam or have errors generated in your projects or exams, go to his office hour. He would explain much better in office hour rather than classes. CSC 151 is a time-consuming but still easy class.
Awesome human being!! Please take him.
Definitely recommend to take his class. He writes good notes, he explains very well and he is not afraid to change grading if he messed up some questions on the homework. Tip is to just make sure you read the material for the class before the lecture.
so good and organized prepared and funny. clear lecture. love him
Charlie is exceptionally thoughtful, prepared, and clear.
Charlie is an amazing human being. Go to office hours if you want anything explained. I would definitely suffer through 151 again if I could have him as a professor. All your assignments are group projects, but that's just about the only negative thing I can think of. 10/10.
Charlie is awesome. Made class fun and was always willing to help during office hours or schedule a time to fit you in. Tough class but worth it.
