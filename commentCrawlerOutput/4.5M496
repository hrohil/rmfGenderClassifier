Everything about the course was fantastic. I learned a lot about Python and computer programming in general, the projects were really fun to implement and just enough of a challenge, and the lectures gave us plenty of time to discuss issues with TAs and the professor.
Really funny and personable guy who makes the class really easy. When we did iClickers he showed us the answer distributions as we guessed so I never had to worry about missing those. He's project heavy and same with programming homework but you have more than enough time to get it done and it's easy to get help from him and TAs.
