Weekly homework. Two tests. Great person. Really cares that the students learn basic CS. There for you if you need him. Take his class!
Wonderful professor with a geeky sense of humor. Great at explaining concepts, very understanding of his students, and made me fall in love with CS again.
He was very clear during lecture, although at times it was a bit boring. He was very fair and the class overall wasn't too hard.
Great intro class. He doesn't try to make his lectures super exciting, but if you're interested in the material like I was it should be pretty interesting. At the very least his lectures are very informative and easy to follow. He's incredibly helpful and will always try to answer any questions you have.
Great introduction to java. The class was alot of work but be prepared to put in effort, especially if this is your first programming class. Professor Sun was super helpful.
Although at first he built up a lot of excitement about the course, his lectures became very dry and useless to go to. He gave a pop "quiz" every now and then for attendance purposes, but you could get away with not going a few times. He is an incredibly nice and knowledgeable guy when you meet with him, but it is hard to stay alert in lectures.
