Very attentive to students feedback. She moves quickly through material and can be very blunt. Expects students to be organized. Will help you if you need it.
Great professor, best in CS I've ever had (though I've never taken a class with Ran or Dodds). Lectures are very clear, assigns lots of homework but learn a lot.
Her lecture sequence is well organized. She takes student feedback throughout the course, but devotes a day specifically so that students can elaborate on their thoughts of how the class is taught. A lot of the criticism that is given to this class is more attached to the required material of the class rather than Prof. Wu herself, which is unfair.
The class was difficult, but she did a pretty good job explaining things in office hours. Feedback is prompt, but expectations weren't always clear.
She seems to have good experience with software industry, but she is not helpful and is usually unwilling to help students with their needs. She doesn't respond emails often. Comparing to other extremely helpful professors at Mudd, she just doesn't rank high. Oh, she checks whether a person attends a class each lecture.
