She does not teach too much in class, but her homework and tests are really easy.
Lian is one of the professors I would just refer to as above average - she knows her stuff, and if you show up to class, you will understand what she is teaching. At the same time, she isn't really inspirational, and the class is pretty insipid(though she tries make the atmosphere more enthusiastic). Come to class, do the HW, you'll get an A.
