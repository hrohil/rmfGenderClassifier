He speaks at a very low volume, but he is extremely accommodating to those students who make the extra effort to clarify material with him. He is willing to stop the flow of class, or even alter his lesson plan for the week simply because he realizes there is a topic that he needs to spend time clarifying. Overall he cares alot for his students.
He's a newer teacher and he teaches his student as if they already know how to do this stuff. I'm fairly new to programming and I have no idea what hes talking about half the time. He mainly teaches in larger classrooms and then writes on the board in size 2 font. We keep asking him to write larger, but he goes back to writing small the next day.
