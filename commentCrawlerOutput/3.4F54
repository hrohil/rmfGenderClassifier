The only bad comments so far have come from her first year seminar...that's not saying much.  She's very knowledgeable and fair and, although I'll admit at times her lectures lack clarity, she is truly a lot of help when you meet with her one-on-one.
Cathy definately knows her stuff.
it started out pretty good but she doesn't have the talent (?) to teach, especially stuff that requires clear explanation
she tries but its just not happening... fys, quite a horrible experience
sucks
a great person, and really smart.  Doesn't explain things that clearly, but knows her stuff and really willing to help
She's very nice and always offers to help.  Good at explaining concepts and about as relaxed an atmosphere you can get in comp sci.
