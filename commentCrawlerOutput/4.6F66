Had her for Intro CS and loved her. She's extremely friendly and really good at explaining concepts.
Lisa is amazing! She makes even 21 interesting.
In terms of teaching, she is simply outstanding; she can really really teach the subject.  In fact, I'm going for a minor in CS (senior year) now.  Subject is fun and thoroughly useful. Test and quiz material are fair and appropriate.  She is always willing to help and is generous with her time.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but the HW was fun.
