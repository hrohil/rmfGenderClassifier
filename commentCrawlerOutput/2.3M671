i'm not sure if he knows how to use a computer, yet he's the department chair.  go figure.
Koch did a great job of finding varied materials for the subect matter.  He is a funny guy.
Absolutely the worst prof and class (Internet and Beyond) I took in my entire time at Oberlin. Stay away!
Koch is hilarious! Not very clear though :(
Koch once said "My son tells me I speak in context free sentences."  A truer statement has never been uttered on this earth.
This guy doesn't know what he is saying.  He is too old.  I don't understand how he is still teaching.
