Basically failed at teaching.  There was one really cool lecture on peer-to-peer algorithms, the rest was all completely worthless and his lectures almost never had anything remotely to do with what we needed to know.  I strongly wish I had taken 17 instead.
Horrible! That guy is really terrible at teaching or at anything at least remotely related to organizing information in a useful way.
Useless and boring. During lectures he explores random topics and passes quickly through them, but only rarely offering useful information. Assignments are fun, though novices in programming might consider that they exceed the boundaries of an introductory course.
