Amazing professor, one of the smartest I have had at Emory. He knows absolutely everything, and gives great examples in class. Definitely take his class.
Very good
Take his class****** He also has supplementary Youtube video for those who really want to understand the material and those who couldn't get into his class.  Please don't take CS171 with other Professors... I am not going to mention names, but SHE cannot code in java.
Seriously one of the best professors at Emory. He's super smart, communicates everything well. The class is tough but he's pretty much fair and it's one of those classes you can get super into.
Really good professor, would explain everything for you in the office hour.
Likable guy, interesting lectures, as you study more into the field of CS you understand that he was really trying to teach you and emphasize the important stuff. However, he needs to be a little bit more clear in his  lecture and break it down. Although there is a notion of CS171 class which makes it naturally a hard class to understand.
Not very clear in explaining and hardly using the blackboard.....
