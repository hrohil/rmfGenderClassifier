sometimes dull and unimaginative
i find his homework questions to not cover what is taught in class - making them impossible.   He needs to proof read his slides before presenting them to class.    He tries to play the "friendly guy" card to make up for it.  He is a likeable guy if you like spending hours every day figuring out his questions.
He makes learning fun.
Really wants to teach you as much as he can. Great personality, approachable, friendly. be warned, focus is on underlying methods. i.e. making abstract decision matrices not cute soccer robots in AI. hard prog assignments. you learn a lot though!
Tough course, but this guy puts a *lot* of work into being helpful, knowledgeable, and interesting.  Very easy to approach.
class was difficult, but he was a very good teacher. cool guy, too.
Covered a lot of material which I found very helpful since I was interested in the class and wanted to learn as much as I could.  The programming assignments could take up to 40 hours each, but they were very useful if you put in the time.
I thought this class was going to be really interesting. He made it dull and boring and WAY too much work. Programming assignments close to impossible. Talks really fast and tries to cover too much. Prime example of cool subject made unimaginably dull
Interesting, but a lot of work
