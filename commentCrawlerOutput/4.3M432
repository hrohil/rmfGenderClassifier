great class
computer science is davidsons ****. he rules
Awesome, friendly guy, gives really great prizes in class. Brings food for students during tests. Material isn't too challenging, but don't let your guard down. Always willing to help out, very clear teaching though the class is a bit slow-paced.

Class slow-paced, but somewhat interesting. Awesome, friendly guy who's willing to help. Understanding. Gives prizes away to students too.
never bother to show up to his class, the material just is too easy. if you've never had experience with java i guess he's helpful though

Nice guy, def. better than Cohoon... but the class is way too slow-paced.
