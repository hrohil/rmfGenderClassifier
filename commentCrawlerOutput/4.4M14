Great
Took CS108, the intro to object-oriented programming. The first few lectures put me to sleep. The rest weren't necessary, apparently; I didn't go. I got an A in this otherwise useful project class, and my only interaction with Prof. Young worth mentioning was a question he couldn't answer.
Dr. Young is way cool. CS105 changed my life. Made me want to drop out of school and just design webpages.
Tries to make lectures entertaining, but because they are online there is little incentive to go.
Really enjoyed this class, Patrick really makes sure that you understand the material. He wrote the book, so he lectures in a similar "straight forward" manner. Very nice guy, more people should laugh at his dry humor.

Extremely friendly once you get to know him. Come to his office hour and chat with him. Knowledgable and understand what it's like to be an undergraduate. Great lecturer. His exams can be challenging but study and you'll be fine.
explained concepts so that the average person with no comp experience would understand, fair exams and projects
