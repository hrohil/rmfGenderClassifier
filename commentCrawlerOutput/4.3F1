Julie Zelenski is a strong teacher. Knows what she's talking about
Julie is an awesome teacher.  She knows the subject deeply and the TA's (particularly Michael Chang) are outstanding.  Many other students are also very helpful. One of the best classes I've taken.  Understand that unless you are gifted at computer programming you will need to work very hard on this course.
107 is a really hard class but Julie makes you understand all the work is so important if you want to be a programmer
Julie is a great professor, and the CS107 topics are very interesting (even if tough at times). If you're at all interested in what happens under the hood when you run a program (or if you just need to satisfy a requirement), take this class. Make sure to leave time for this class if you want to get the most out of it.
Incredible professor, really cares about how much students learn.
concepts are not taught in thorough way
Superb.
She can be a bit much with her fake enthusiasm and like the guy before me said is not very helpful if you have any questions. If you're expecting a Mehran Sahami, Jerry Cain, or Eric Roberts caliber teacher, you'll be disappointed. Oh well.

Awesome lecturer, fun lectures
Great teacher!
She was a great prof. and renewed my interest in Computer Science.  Is a great speaker, and helps imensely in after hours.
She's actually on maternity leave now, but I think she'll be back.  She was a very good, clear lecturer.  Received a standing ovation at her last class.
Looking back (I took the class years ago) she's one of the best profs I had at Stanford. Given her work outside the University, it lends good perspective in the world of academia.
A stellar lecturer, always eager to help students learn the material - but the midterm had its way with me.

Enthusiastic teacher and knowledgeble - tends to be a bit irritating at times. Interruped my final midway to tell the class to stretch!!
