Morwick is a super nice guy who usually ALWAYS has time available to help you 1-on-1. While this is true, he also has some pretty frustrating downfalls. He assumes a lot of prior knowledge of the subject, is not always clear on the concepts he is trying to get across to students during lectures, and teaches VERY fast.
Nice guy. He teaches class very fast but he is cool and always willing to help out. He loves answering questions. In fact, participation is a huge factor in his class via tickets.
Extremely helpful in and outside the class! I wish all Computer Science professor could be like him. I just took one class with him and now I'm thinking majoring in CS!
