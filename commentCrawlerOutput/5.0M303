This class has short, weekly homework assignments. to reinforce the lectures and readings. I highly recommend doing the readings. The lectures won't help much if you're not a seasoned computer person. The exams are take-home. I would say the class is mediocre difficulty except for the final exam. The python portion is extremely difficult! Prepare!
Joshua is by far the best instructor I have ever had. I am now working in the field and no other instructor came close to preparing me as well as Joshua did. Accurately rating the easiness of the course is impossible. The work was fun, it didn't seem like work. Joshua is incredibly available to his students, and I still pick his brain when stumped.
Best professor I've had. Clear lecture materials. Extra materials at the end for those who want to go the extra mile. Incredibly available to students. Fun and challenging projects. Hugely relevant material. Expects a lot from his students, but if you do the work you will do well in the course. Expect to work hard but be rewarded for it.
