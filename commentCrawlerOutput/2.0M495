This was a required class for computer science. This class seriously made me rethink my major. I hated every second of it. Labs and projects were vague and hard to understand. Tests were crazy hard. My TA was decent, but the Edwards is extremely unhelpful. Never actually answers questions and never likes to admit when he is wrong or unfair.
This professor seems alright during class and in lectures but the work gets tough pretty much after the first exam. This class starts easy then gets exponentially harder every week. Be prepared to work hard. The Lab assignments that he posts online are not as descriptive and do not help when doing the Labs or projects. Best of Luck.
