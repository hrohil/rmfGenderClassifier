Micah is a good professor. If you take his course, you should be prepared to deal with a lot of things -- 2 midterms, 1 final, 6 reading quizzes and 4 hws including programming. He gives high grades on hws and midterms. But don't expect that he will curve the total grades. What mentioned on lecture will definitely appear on the exams.
I'm taken a number of CS profs at Georgetown, and he's by far the best one. Actually knows how to teach -- brings the material to just the right level of accessibility. Assessments do what exactly they're supposed to do -- make you pay attention to the material, and test to see if you've done that. Tough but fair. Pretty responsive via Piazza.
Best professor at Georgetown. I typically fall asleep in my classes especially when there is a powerpoint but you will not sleep. Professor Sherr is great at giving you the right amount of information so that you feel like you are learning and not overwhelmed and his cheesy jokes aren't that bad. Also his projects are legitimately fun to do
Easily one of the best courses offered by Georgetown's Computer Science department--and, hands down, the most interesting one.  Expect two midterms of moderate difficulty, and an easy final exam. A few networking assignments here-and-there too, but nothing too crazy.  Sherr is a very lenient grader too, and class is always exciting. def recommend!
Learned a TON of highly practical and applicable concepts in the class.  The lectures are fairly dry, but if you keep up--stay awake that is--you shouldn't have any issue getting a good grade. Two midterms, a final, and a series of programming assignments. You also get to play with drones at the end of the course! highly recommend.
I hate to give Prof. Sherr a bad rating, because he is really knowledgable and a nice person. However, I have never had such a difficult class with such little guidance and direction. The projects are complicated and you really aren't taught how to do them. Would take him again for a different class, but I did not appreciate how he runs this course
