This instructor may know computing, but he lacks the necessary skills and ability to teach. He was never adequately prepared for class-he winged it. He was unable to explain information such as the subject content, assignments, etc. in an organized, clear and concise manner. His deameanor was nervous, high strung and impatient.
didn't have him for a class, but he's always been very helpful with computer stuff on campus.  If I wasn't so dumb, I'd take his classes, but he would skool me too bad
