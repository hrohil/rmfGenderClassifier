Fabulous teacher. If you're interested in teaching computer science, go watch this guy teach. He is obviously interested in the material and has a superb command of what he teaches. When he doesn't know something, which is rare, he admits it. He's demanding, but very fair and very clear about his expectations. People do well in his classes.
