One of the best professors to take this course . She made things easy and clear . That to  when it comes to homeworks , She helps the best she can to make us understand and do things . One of the best classes I have taken at UIC as of now. Attending her classes was fun and after every class I felt I learnt something that I didn't know .
She was great, super helpful, kept things fun, and knew her stuff. UIC's lucky to have her. Used i-clickers (helpful for learning and tracks participation) and had the class split up into small 3-person discussion groups.
Cynthia rules. Easiest one of the most helpful, engaging professors I've had at Oberlin. She knows her stuff, doesn't take crap, and takes the time to make sure that you, too, can know your stuff and not take crap.
Cynthia is great, really nice and really helpful. She does a good job fostering in-class discussion, and actually made iClicker usage interesting/fun.
Cynthia is an awesome professor - smart/approachable/understanding/friendly (and really cool).
Very interesting subject material, clearly knows what she's talking about. Also clearly doesn't know how to talk about it, mainly the lectures and discussion questions were unclear or miswritten and the homework assignments were conceptually much easier to implement than it was to muddle through the shortcomings of the platforms she assigned to us.
