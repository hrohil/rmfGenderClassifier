Down to Earth professor, relates to his students. He's not an overly difficult instructor, but if you don't put in the effort, you aren't going to get the grades you want. You need to try to get that A.
Sometimes you have to do extra, not on the grading rubric, in order to get all the points. He isn't the type of teacher I would want again in the future, but he his tolerable.
awesome guy
