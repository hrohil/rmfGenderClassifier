Dr. Barnett is a great teacher, most people in the class had never taken a computer science class (myself included) and he did a good job of explaining the concepts behind the code. He is really nice and cares about each student's success and understanding, so he is always available and very helpful in office hours. I hope I get to take him again!
I really enjoyed Dr. Barnett's section of IQS. His lectures did get a little boring at times, but he explained the content and his expectations well. I thought his exams were very fair. We (IQS) had homework (which was like a few small programs) once every two weeks or so. He was helpful in office hours and his grading was fair and predictable.
Dr. Barnett is always there to help. Just make sure to ask questions during the lectures and schedule appointments with him.
Barnett is a good teacher. He sometimes puts quirky internet jokes into his power points and he gets really excited about computers. The labs are time consuming and are pretty tough, but the class really helped me understand the basics of computers.
His teaching is not clear and not in detail. He's always willing to help, but he's not very  good at communicating with students, especially when you have big questions that needs him to explain a lot.
Best professor ever.  Extremely helpful and always available. TAKE HIS CLASS!
