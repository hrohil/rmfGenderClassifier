Pretty ridiculous class. Gave extra credit for "essays" about your friends.  Uses smiley faces as variables. Interesting material; poor delivery. But a really nice guy...
His class is pretty useless. He gets up there and gives absurd presentations involving smiley faces, and then has sets on unrelated material.
Cool dude!
This guy is awesome!, Nice guy, funny, down to earth, and is really into being a good teacher, (which he is).  The class was nuts hard but this guy made it bareable and very very interesting.
