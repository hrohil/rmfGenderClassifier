good sir and teach from basic on programming
very good professor.
No doubts, one of the best. Very good combination of theory and practice.
I've taught this stuff for decades and Jerry explained it better, and way, way faster, than I ever have. Inspirational.
Great teacher, great lecturer super clear and helpful!
Jerry is the boss! Explains Computer Systems very clearly and really cares about his students.
Jerry always makes the class significantly harder. His lectures go very quickly, if you don't pay attention for 1 second, you're lost for the rest of the class. He's good at explaining, but I feel goes too quickly in lecture and doesn't stop enough to make sure students are getting it. Explanations could be less code heavy and more visual.
He is one of the best teachers out there.
One of the best teachers I have ever had. He explains everything very well, makes it fun, and is also super helpful. If you have him you are lucky!
Very nice one.
He is a genius
Tough, but fair.  Great teacher, excellent explanations
Awesome SUPER Awesome
Good dedicated prof.Looks arrogant but is good.
good lecture; sometime too fast
Great lecturer, demanding and makes sure his students learn significantly more than with other teachers in the same course. His manner seems a bit arrogant and unapproachable, but is actually helpful when asked. His classes are a CS boot-camp, do expect quite a bit of work.
Great and intelligent.
The best one. CS143 is really really i been was very nice. I learnt a lot.
Oh man, Cain is the bomb.
Jerry rocks. Seriously, he's the best teacher you'll ever have.
