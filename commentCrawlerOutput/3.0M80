Very helpful professor. He takes his time to really help you with any question you might have regarding your project/presentation. He isn't the only one grading your presentation, your fellow students do it as well. I enjoyed his class, I would certainly recommend it.
researcher - not a teacher; limited experience running an entire course/real life experience.
