I took an Intro to C Programming class with Sonny as a Columbia High School Summer Program. The experience was amazing. I went into the class with almost no coding experience, and he was able to turn me into a confident amateur coder. Sonny taught us the fundamentals in a clear and concise fashion. He is by far the best teacher that I've ever had.
I had Songqiao Li "Sonny" over the summer during the Columbia University summer program. He was a great professor who made class interesting everyday. Sonny encouraged group work, and was always available to answer questions or clear doubts. I really enjoyed Sonny's class and would highly recommend him to anyone interested in CS.
Sonny is a really good teacher. He always prepares for the class and gives clear explanation on new topics which is really helpful for me.
An excellent professor who makes a real effort to teach.
i wrote 20+ programs in 3 weeks :)
