Professor Julovich is very knowledgeable and teaches well, but he can go a little fast through things. Ask questions and you'll be fine! Go to class and take notes over what he says because it will most likely be very important going forward. All the content is cumulative so practicing it and doing the exercises correctly will help you.
-Attendance isn't mandatory, but almost is because you will sometimes not understand homework -Homework everyday. If you go in for class everyday (and even just halfway listen) you'll pass -Do well on the exams and you'll float through the course -Textbook is provided for you -At first wasn't the best, then he progressively got better
Professor Julovich is not accessible at all, you cannot catch him out of class, ever. He cares about the students who work very hard and show that they care about the course. However, he is awful at assigning things, he uses old curriculum's instructions which make it incredibly hard to get a perfect grade on some of the homework and final.
This is a class where if you go to class, put in effort, and pay attention you will do okay. Make friends with the kids around you because they will be helpful when everyone is confused and Julovich doesn't have time to help everyone. Julovich genuinely cares about his students if you actually try and care about the class.
He was always very willing to go back and re-explain things as many times as necessary to make sure everyone understood what he was trying to do.  Always willing to change an assignment grade if you talk to him about it,  don't be afraid to ask something cause honestly everyone is probably thinking the same thing, no one just says it
By far the worst teacher I have had at IU.  I've been to every class but 1 this semester and am fighting for a C- and the final project is awful.
Just an absolute terrible teacher. He was too lazy to convert the homework assignments from oncourse to canvas so the directions did not coincide with the provided templates at all. Fliessss through the material during class but then acts like you're dumb having to ask a question or need him to slow down. Needless to say, do not take this class.
Horrible professor. He does not clarify instructions well at all. Directions for assignments are absurdly vague. The final project is virtually impossible. The directions are convoluted, confusing, and contradictory. By far the ABSOLUTE WORST professor I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!
More or less a jerk. Don't come in late or he will give you death stares and you will be on his bad side. Insists that you should ask questions if you need help, but gets annoyed when students ask questions (which is every 5 seconds because he does 3 steps in the time it takes you to do one). Gave a 20 point pop quiz class before spring break.
