This was a Coursera course at the first-year grade level (although assuming you can program, and if not they have an amazing book for that too). The course was taught in collaboration with Prof Sedgewick, who did the lectures. Prof Wayne was also participating in the forums, and I found his contribution critically important.
Kevin Wayne is a really great professor. Lectures are clear and well planned.
