Favorite professor. Class is hard, but he is extremely accessible outside of class. He wants you to succeed. Lecture is entertaining.
great guy
He is extremely intelligent and makes sure that he is clearly articulating what he is trying to get across. Most of the in class learning is hypothetical and aims to teach the underlying principals of the material. Labs/Homework are where you learn to implement the material into actual code
He is humorous and has his own way of teaching.You could skip the class but at your own risk because there are no textbook nor lecture notes.Not very strict about late submission of work.Quite easygoing. Class is moving pretty fast and a bit challenging, the lab assignments are very important to consolidate and apply what you learned in the class
He is somewhat disorganized but at the same time you can see that he is really intelligent -- he knows his stuff!
Nice and funny professor. You can tell he hates showoffs in class. Pretty easygoing, accepts late work becasue he wants you to learn. Will put people on the spot sometimes, but always senses when the class is not getting it. Labs range from easy to long and challenging. Lab directions tend to be unclear, teaching style is unorganized and informal.
I always enjoyed going to class as Professor Rager is quite comical. I think that most learning took place in actually doing the labs versus talking about hypothetical programs in class. Prof Rager was always available to answer questions on assignments which got progressively harder towards the end of the semester.  Good class!
