Looking back Dr. Wenk is the best CS prof at Tulane. She is very helpful in and out of class and really does care about everyone succeeding. The class itself was hard but not impossible. If you stay on top of the work and go into office hours when you get stuck you'll probably get As/Bs on everything. There are a few hard projects though. Take her!
Dr. Wenk is a knowledgeable and patient instructor. I found her classes most clearly explained out of all CS courses at Tulane. She's always available and all materials written on board are photographed and uploaded, which is a tremendous help when studying for midterm/final. Projects are challenging but right on point to practice useful concepts.
A very straightforward class; show up and pay attention and you'll get an easy A. The material isn't challenging, but is fairly interesting through most of the course. Professor Wenk explains things very clearly and will always help you out if you get confused.
Solid explanations given on concepts, and with powerpoints usually accompanied the lectures. Homework is super easy, as anything above a 60% is curved up to 100%. Most people were not close to the threshold, though. Tests are more challenging than homework, but very doable. All notes posted online, which was very helpful.
Lectures are clear, with lots of accompanying diagrams/drawings used to explain concepts. The class is an introduction to proof class, so it focuses on lots of different areas in minimal depth, making it rather easy. Tests were very similar to material covered in class.
Weekly homework takes HOURS, but greater than a 60% is rounded up to a 100. No tests except for one midterm and a final, but weekly 10-point quizzes in the labs. Attendance is not mandatory, but recommended.
I took Carola for Discrete Math. She clearly knows the material, she just can't teach it. You will learn more from the TA in the lab than you will the rest of the week. Take advantage of the TA office hours. Long weekly homeworks that are so difficult all you need is a 60% to get a 100.
