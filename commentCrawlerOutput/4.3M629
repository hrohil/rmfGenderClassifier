Great hands-on class technical course Very knowledgeable in subject matter Mid-term and final are a lot of work Fair grader Helpful and accommodating regarding assignments
Challenging material, but Dr. Bader was very clear in his lectures, sync sessions and other communications.  Keep up with the readings, practice the exercises from the text, and reach out to him and peers if needed.  If I could do well in this class with ZERO prior knowledge of database systems, anyone can.
Very helpful professor.  Knows what he's talking about and always willing to help you via supplemental tutorials and presentations.  Ask for help and direction - you'll get it.  Make sure you read the assigned text and complete exercises.  Overall fun, informative class.  Didn't struggle.  But didn't slack on reading and work either.
