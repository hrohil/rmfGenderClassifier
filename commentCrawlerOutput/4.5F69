Christine is a gem! I absolutely loved her lectures. They are very clear and well structured, but you can get more if you read the textbook beforehand. She loves to talk to students and she is great at explaining things. Not every available for office hours, but replies to email pretty quickly.
Christine's amazing! She takes time in class to make sure everyone understands the,  which makes the class so much more manageable that it would be otherwise. 230 requires a ton of time and effort but she makes it a genuinely great experience anyway  Attendance isn't mandatory per se but if you skip classes/labs you won't do well
Christine is a great person! She's sweet, caring, and engaging during class. She explains things quite thoroughly and stops a lot for questions. Her pace is a little slow (we often have a lot of material uncovered at the end of class), but she continues this at the beginning of the next class. Not one of the best professors I've had, but good!
She gives extremely clear, logical, lectures with useful examples. She answers questions thoroughly, thoughtfully, and with great knowledge of the material. She's an engaging lecturer. She is also very helpful in office hours, though be prepared to wait because her office hours are popular!
I wasn't interested in computer science at all, but I loved CS110 and am now thinking of taking other CS courses. Christine was really helpful and funny when I went to her office hours. The material is a bit confusing, so make sure that you take advantage of office hours.
