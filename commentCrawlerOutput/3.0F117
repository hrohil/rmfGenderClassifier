Very nice teacher and outlines everything she expects in detail. Great exam review that follows the questions exactly. Not a lot of assignments so you are able to focus on the 2 tests and business proposal.
Terrible teacher, not helpful, unrealistic standards, excruciating assignments. If you take her class, you will be miserable the entire semester!
Her midterm and final are not open book as the other professor who teaches ISYS 203U.  The midterm review was extremely broad compared to the topics that were actually on it.  The review was not very helpful.  If you are going to take this class, then take it with Dertinger if he is available.
