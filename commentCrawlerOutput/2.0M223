Few people actually attend class: the material doesn't require it. However, for those who do go to class, his lectures are helpful and relevant. The class is large, and he doesn't have time to address questions that he's already explained thoroughly, but overall he's a good, if somewhat dry, lecturer.
Incredibly boring class.  I have several issues with the way the class is structured and graded; it should address much more probability (which is what we actually need) but Franco is too obstinate to change it.  Franco as a professor is unrecommendable, but 22 is easy with or without him.

Exams do not test knowledge of material, but are essentially IQ tests that require "aha" insight for success. Students asking questions in class are treated rudely. A brilliant mind and excellent researcher, but he has much to learn about teaching.
