Took his intro to programming class, but was more advanced than intro. He's a visiting adjunct professor from France. Funny in his own way. Not very easy to follow - I stopped going to lectures because his slides are online. He's as helpful as possible and is usually available, but TAs were the best resource for his class and weekly assignment.
