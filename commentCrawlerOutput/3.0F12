She is really nice. But her lecture is not very organized. She usually seems nervous and speaks very fast. It is very easy to get bored or get lost in her lecture. And her exams are pretty hard.
She really knows her stuff and is super helpful when you ask her questions on a 1 on 1 basis, but when she lectures, she tends to speak very quietly and over generalize things sometimes. This class is also a little strange because it is co taught by Prof Beth and Prof Z and they seem like polar opposites and Prof Z is not a particularly good prof.
