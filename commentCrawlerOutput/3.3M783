He's a great professor and really knows what he's talking about. You'll get a lot more out of the course if you actually go. Projects are a big part of your grade-start them early and go to help rooms.
Spends the first 10 minutes going over online current event articles he found related to computer science. These are unnecessary to the class, but very interesting. CSE 232 is a tough class, but Punch is good. His personification of the C++ compiler was pretty funny. Start projects early and study smart for the hard exams. Easy 3.0 if you work hard
Worst instructor for CSE. Good luck taking a class with him.
Great prof, hard class if you never show up to class. Get him and you'll do well
Very good prof, does a great job explaining the material.  Helps explain the projects every week
