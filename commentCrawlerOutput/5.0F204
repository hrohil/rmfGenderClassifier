Prof. Colbry is a very good prof.  This class is the first "real" CSE class in the CSE series.  If you don't like programming, then you may not like this class overall.  All of the CSE professor make that abundantly clear.  Nonetheless, Colbry is very nice and her exams are *very* fair.  Easy professor, relatively hard class in and of itself.
