Very helpful outside of class.
Plan on a math class. Always available, caring, as much individual help as I needed. Knows his stuff. Several large projects, "hat" problems. Good lectures, but very technical.
Good knowledgeable teacher. Just be aware that his classes are extremely theoretical, and really turn Computer Science into a sort of math. (Not that this is bad, just... difficult.)
Clear and knowledgable. Very approachable, good guy; intelligent and caring.
Enthusiastic.  Keeps you motivated.  Intelligent and willing to always help.
