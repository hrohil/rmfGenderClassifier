Blake was super easy for intro CS, he responds to emails very quickly and generally is the man.
Classes with Blake are easy, but you won't learn much. He's not a good lecturer and it seems like he doesn't know the material well. He spent a lot of time on trivial or obvious details and didn't clearly explain the fundamental concepts. Quizzes, exams and homework aren't difficult, but demand small random details rather than true understanding.
Blake does not know how to teach an Intro class. He is very nice, but spends ridiculous amounts of time on trivial things and not nearly enough time on important ideas. I rely heavily on TAs, prefects, and CS majors to understand what is going on.
Blake is a terrific professor. While relying a little heavily on textbook reading for concept learning, he gives fantastic lectures with helpful examples to illustrate programming concepts. He prepares students for the important ethical issues behind CS. There's a mild amount of HW and labs are well designed. He's kind with a great sense of humor.
This man is a living angel. He's super funny presents his lectures with clear and concise notes. His handwriting sucks but he's attractive so it evens out. He also writes his zero's weirdly. He puts a mark through them. Class is fun, easy, and dreamy (well he is, but you get the point).
Blake is an excellent professor, he is witty and kind, but also extremely intelligent and clear. It also helps that he is very attractive. I would suggest this professor to anyone who wants a fun, interesting course!
