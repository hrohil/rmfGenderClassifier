Wilson was very polarizing - 80% of students hated him being for a dictionary, the rest of learned an enormous amount from his lectures. Rest in peace Wilson.
His assignments were too hard and his obsession with XP programming was annoying, but I thought his lectures were very good. He is very knowledgable and into what he teaches.
the one class where I didn't have to 'try' to fall asleep....it just happened
he is like an encyclopedia of programming information... with a hugeass padlock on it.  and whenever you try to pry it open, the only things that come out are impossible assignments.
Lectures are usually dry and pretty boring.  Very knowledgable, and always fields questions and answers them sufficiently.  One of the smartest guys around, just not a captivating lecturer.  The assignments are ridiculously difficult too...
worst lecturer I've seen in my life. Might as well learned from a book.
Horrible lecturer. His brain is an encyclopedia of C++ code however.
tough projects but a fair teacher and good lecuturer
