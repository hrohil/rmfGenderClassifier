Dr. Wallace knows his stuff &amp; has a significant background in IT. He's ready to share.  He passes out some assignments in class, so you better go to most of them.  There is a lot of homework but it's not too time consuming.  When it comes to the mid-term and final projects, get ready to write - a lot!  Exams aren't too difficult though.
Not a difficult class, but expect homework and papers.  Do the work well and you will past.  Has a wealth of knowledge to share with the class. Do not procrastinate.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.
Great Instructor!  Be prepared to work hard and write papers.
His class follows the syllabus to the T. Its mostly just a lot of menial homework, and not at all intellectually challenging. Dr. Wallace definitely knows what he's talking about and is willing to help and answer questions.
