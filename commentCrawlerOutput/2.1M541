Had Dr. Boom back in the early 1980's.... Boom Boom Belkhouche... never understood his class... never was of any use in my professional life.
He is a great person as well as a great professor. He is very helpfull and if he sees a possibility that you become a good student then he will open many doors for you. He is humble and easy to deal with. I really think he is one of my best proffessors. He is one of the few proffessors who listen's to their students. His exams are not easy.
Prog. Lang. '05: 
 Teaches with Pascal!!! Project in C (not even C++)!    
 Focuses on contour model for almost whole semester when all it does is trace progrmas like in 101.   He is very ambigous (possibly purposely) about what he wants out of students.  I'd say avoid him at all costs, but he's the only one who teaches it!  I got an A in the class
I had already been exposed to most of the material, but I don't know what I would have done if it was new to me. He was horrible at explaining concepts to students and event worse with the projects he assigned. I would avoid his class like the plague!

Belkhouche...ah, Belkhouche.  Boring Comp Sci lectures, useless sycophant TA, demanding projects, including one at the very end of the semester that had 95% of the class weeping for two weeks.
