This was the best course that I ever taken at IU.  He really cared about his students and learning to program with Alice was fun.  He really knew his stuff. I highly recommend taking this course for anybody thinking about computers and technology
He was the best instructor and really knew JAVA well. I wish he taught more Informatic Classes...
An awesome teacher who really cares how his students do in class. He makes sure you know whats going on and doesn't try to teach too much.
He really wants everyone to learn and loves what he does.  He makes the class fun and is sympathetic to students.  Plus everything in that class is really useful for other classes.
He isn't bad.  He wants everyone to do well and he'll pretty much do anything for you that you need.  The material wasn't fun, but he is really down to earth and nice.

A little monotone, but he knows his stuff.
Not a great speaker.  He was never very clear on the different parts of the computer and their uses
