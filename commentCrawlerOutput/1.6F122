She's at USC, has no freaking idea how to teach a class. Her lectures are no help to the midterm, doesn't even use the book or mention it even for us to study. I had no prior knowledge and I am confident to say that I tried to study, but there was no way for me to get help. Even her TA's are awful.
She teaches CS101 at USC now. It seems like she has no idea what she's doing while teaching. The labs are a joke, and in lectures we spend more time listening to her talk about nonsense rather than learning how to program. Luckily, I had programming knowledge prior to the class, otherwise I would be screwed for CS 102
very poor teacher. her lectures were unorganized and i seemed to know more about c++ than she did at times. The class was very easy though so take her if you know c++ already.
Class was a joke. Lectures were confusing and she never answered questions clearly. Labs were easy, as were the first half of the assignments. She posted the exams online. Don't take her if you seriously want to learn about C++.
