Great and knowledgeable
Dr. Mickel is awesome! He's engaged in the class and really wants his students to succeed. Anytime I had questions he was always going the extra mile to make sure they were answered. This is one of those classes that I really think will be useful to me as I look for jobs and move forward in my professional career. You definitly work for your grade
It is a shame that W&amp;L's best professors isn't actually in the comp. sci. department. I took Dr. Mickel for a databases course and learned so much. He goes out of his way to make time to help students during office hours. He's awesome. Highly recommend taking him if you have the chance.
Professor Mickel is new to W&amp;L, but one of the best professors I've taken here. He is incredibly knowledgeable about all things computer related and really wants students to learn. He makes himself accessible to answer questions at any time of the day, even during an exam he will get back to you within minutes.  He is a nice guy and fair grader.
