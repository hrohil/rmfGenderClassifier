He is a good professor who is not a difficult grader. He wants students to do well in the class, and gives tests that reflect the class material. Sometimes is a little all over the place during lecture, but overall, pretty clear and easy to undertsand.
I thought he was a very helpful teacher, actually teaches and writes notes in class unlike Westmoreland who expects you to learn it all on your own. Helpful and nice if you go in for extra help, if you do the homework and keep up with the work you will do well
The thing is, he does not grade fairly; he's not a fan of partial credit.  I'm not shocked anymore to see 0/5 or 0/10 on questions where I clearly have a half-decent grasp on it.  He is very picky and uncompromising.  I seriously had the feeling that he often didn't want me to do well.  With any other prof, that B would definitely be a solid A.
Feil is an excellent teacher, though his tests are pretty tough. He explains problems very clearly.
good prof, helpful
good guy, taught well, decent tests
was not very consistent - had to write a chapter of logic proof and mine was the only critiqued in front of the entire class :( - not very helpful as an advisor
wow is he hard, but very good
