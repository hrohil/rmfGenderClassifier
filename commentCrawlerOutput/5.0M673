Adam is a professor that can make even boring computer science lessons a pleasantly fun experience. He understands why the material is difficult, and knows to be patient with students. Lectures were clear and effective, and encouraged discussion outside of class. He's also easy to contact, and is very nice and interesting. An ideal professor.
His lectures are damn clear. I skipped so many classes and sort of regretted it. Also, he is extremely patient with "noobs" like me in a intro class. He takes time to explain and not get frustrated. Moreover, unlike other CS 150 profs, he is very lenient on grading exams. Take him as the lecturer AND lab instructor.
He is so good. Clear in every sentences and instructions. Make computer science easy and approachable. Really really love him. Definitely will major in cs if met him earlier.
