Amherst's CS Department is full of brilliant professors and Prof. Valentine is definitely up there. The class was interesting, her lectures were clear and the assignments fun. She's also 'there for you' as in is willing to unlock inadvertently locked-up labs even at night if you need them. Must-take!
