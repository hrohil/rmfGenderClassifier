Hany is very funny and clear,, you will really understand his lectures and you can do well in the course. However, he doesn't personally interact well with or care about his students, and makes it clear that he doesn't even make an effort to learn names. Only wish he could have been more approachable
overrated. doesn't really care about students.
Really enjoyed his teaching. Overall a great prof.
