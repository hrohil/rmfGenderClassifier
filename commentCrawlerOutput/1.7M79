Very dry subject, and I never used assembly, they were using CUSP and moved to MIPS, but I think this is for an area of industry which is not super popular, unless you go very low level.
This professor just reads off the slides and doesn't explain anything about programming..
He sucks!!! We had 40 somethin people enrolled and only 4 people showed up to class because he can't teach. He reads off slides which don't make sense to anyone at all unless you already know the material well. Pretty much...take Smallberg or atleast go to his lectures.
