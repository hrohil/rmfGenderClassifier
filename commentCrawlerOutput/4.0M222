Great guy!
I was very afraid of him at first,but he's actually the kindest grandpa. He really cares about his students and if you come to him to ask for advice or help, he'll find a way to help you, even if you aren't in his class or his advisee. Works to make the dept culture better. Very fair and transparent grading criteria; I always knew how I was doing.
