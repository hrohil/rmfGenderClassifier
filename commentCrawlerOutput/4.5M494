One of my favorite CS professors I've had so far at VT. Lectures were engaging and participation was encouraged. He really knows his stuff when it comes to computers and was able to make lectures interesting and fun with jokes!
Dr. Butt's offering of this course is very research-oriented; the class is based around reading, reviewing and presenting papers. The project is also basically as smallish research project.  You should take it only if you're really interested in OS and distributed systems.
