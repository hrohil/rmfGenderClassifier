I find the course material itself interesting - that's why I took this class. But I don't like it at all. The professor gives confusing lectures and lab instructions, and is sometimes disrespectful to students. The grading standard is not clear nor consistent. I rate it an avoid-at-all-costs / 10.
She is the most strict grader I have had for any class at Tulane so far. Her English isn't great so it is difficult to pay attention to her lectures and she often misunderstands questions when you try to ask for help. She has made me heavily reconsider my computer science major.
Honestly, I regret taking her machine learning class as a graduate student. She is not open to the needs of the students and has short office hours. Finding appointment with her is tough as she is always working on her own research stuff. As far as assignments are concerned, she does not grade anything till the end of the semester.
