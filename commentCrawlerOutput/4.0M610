I had the pleasure of having Dr. Watson for CS 5383 and he is hands down the best CS professor I've ever had. He grades the graduate students harder than the undergrads, but his grading policy helps you make up for past mistakes on the final to get a higher average in the class. He also provides practice problems and tests are very fair
Take Watson if you want a pretty easy class. As long as you show up for the review before the exam and give the bare minimum effort, you'll be fine. Pretty friendly and funny guy, good to talk to.
I've had Dr. Watson 3 times now. I have to say this is the absolute worse one with him. There was absolutely no structure to the course; I don't think the class had a clue as to what we were learning. We went over concepts that I don't ever expect to see again. He was more focused on his achievements than relevant material for this course.
Exceptional communication, my favorite teacher.
Extremely easy! We never did anything in class besides talk about the local weather and cops. I slept most of the time (in the front row) and got an "A" for the class. There were a couple of short papers we had to write, but nothing difficult.
Overall an excellent professor. You learn a lot, and it's not hard to make an A. He gives excellent, interesting lectures. Take this professor's class!
