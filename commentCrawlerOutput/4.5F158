Sherri's amazing. Although her lectures sometimes can be a bit confusing and she assigns a lot of homework, she is so funny and approachable, and that really helped me get through the class. Her tests aren't bad, but the homework takes a while to finish.
Ah! Sherri is super sweet and I ended up doing a lot better in the class than I originally anticipated. However, I would not say she is AS easy as people suggest: her exams are still exams that are challenging. That being said, she is incredibly understanding and very entertaining. Overall, would 100% recommend for Intro comp sci :D
Insanely easy. Workload less than 3 hours per week. Her lectures are a little bit disorganized but in general very helpful.
I liked Sherri a lot but thought she was a bit disorganized. She's also not particularly very difficult.
Sherri is super chill
Sheri was simply incredible for Data Structures. Her lectures were very clear, yet very entertaining. Her assignments did an excellent job helping students learn the material, while being relatively easy. She is one of the best CS profs I've ever had the pleasure of taking a course from.
Awesome professor with even more character than her hair (which changes color every ~2 weeks) has colors!
nice, helpful, awesome
Awesome!
