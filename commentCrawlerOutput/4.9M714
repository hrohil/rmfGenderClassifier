He is a great professor. If you want to learn at a very reasonable pace which contains fun and humor, take him. He gives you a lot of quizzes but he doesn't make them that hard at all really. if you know your stuff and actually do the work, you'll walk out with an A. His tests are very nice cause they will have a lot of easy questions.
Understanding his students so well. He's so adorable.
Only took the class for the lab and group requirement, but Thede made it worth taking anyway. Very clear explanations, easy assignments, and accessible outside of class.
Scott is a great teacher, this is my second class with him and he is great. He explains the material very well and he is very helpful. This class is not very hard because Scott is a very good teacher. Definitely recommend the class.
Scott is a great guy, he is very helpful inside and outside of class. His tests aren't too bad either. I would definitely recommend taking one of his classes.
Great guy, excellent teacher. Explains everything and everything is crystal clear. I recommend taking one of his classes.
Great professor.  Does in class activities that are relevant and helpful for homework and projects.  His classes are very engaging.  Very funny and willing to answer questions and explain concepts again.
