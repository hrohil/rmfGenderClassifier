Overall, she was a fairly good teacher and will probably get better with time. She was good at giving help and seems to care about her students. However, she's very strict, intimidating, and completely unrelatable as a person. About half the students dropped after the first day and kids were terrified of her. She's also arrogant and condescending.
She can be tough, but she has so many resources for students and is very helpful.
She was the worst teacher I had at Macalester
Very difficult professor. Did not explain things very well, and her tests reflected the lack of understandinng. People dropped her 100 level statistics course because it was too difficult.
Do not take her class. Kids dropped her INTRODUCTORY Statistics course like flies at the adddrop deadline. Super harsh grader. Very difficult.
So far She is my favorite professor at Mac. Super helpful and funny.  Though she could be harsh on homework grading.
Young, tries to relate to us with her youth, but also needs to express her superiority through super strict grading procedures (e.g. small mistakes lead to zeros on the homework.) Would make a good bureaucrat in Soviet Russia. Okay maybe that's a little harsh. But she is very helpful in class and answers questions very well.
