Teaches broad concepts during lecture, but focuses on regurgitating memorized lists for tests.
Great Professor. Go to class and pay attention and class is a breeze. Rambles of topic sometimes, but I actually liked it because it would delay tests or quiz's till another day. Overall one of the best teachers I have had so far.
Good professor.  Better sit in the front of class though, or you won't be able to see the PowerPoints.  It's hard for him to stay on topic usually, but he explains most things well.
He's a great teacher.. Sometimes we have to catch his mistakes when he writing on the board.. but as far as teaching goes it pretty good. His tests are pretty fair. He got multiple choice and code snippets you must know how to write. His program assignments are pretty neat. recommend anybody to take him.
Easy to understand and will do everything possible to help you get the material. A must take professor for this course.
