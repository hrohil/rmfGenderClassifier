Very easy class for the first half if you took digital logic before as it is essentially just a digital logic review. Once you get to assembly it gets harder but still isn't too bad. He's a good lecturer and wants you to do well. Everything was graded extremely, extremely leniently though. There also isn't a lot of work given out. Good class
Andy is a good guy and a good teacher. The class is all quizzes (graded normally, but ranging in difficulty from pretty easy to very hard; the hard ones aren't graded too harshly), assignments (graded VERY leniently), and the final, which is basically structured as a longer quiz. Andy has a bit of an accent but he does a good job teaching
Homework is hard, but you got most solution online; Quiz is very hard, but TA graded them extremely leniently; Final is almost like the rehash of all the quiz. In a nutshell, next time you saw his name on the course list do not hesitate to take it.
This was his first time teaching this class. Grades are not very difficult to obtain. However, his teaching standards are not that high. Perhaps, he needed more experience in teaching this particular class.
His course is kinda like a CGPA booster. He is helpful and nice guy. Not so well on explaining part.
Andy is a great guy.  Incredibly nice, but not great at explaining.  He is very understanding and wants you to do well.
Prof. Gokhale's class is not difficult, but he expects hard work. Start early on assignments, go to class, put forth some hard work, get help (as early as possible) if you have trouble and you will do well.
Bi-weekly quizzes, 4-5 programming assignments, 1 presentation, no final. Lectures can be dry but are informative and he clearly knows his stuff. You can still do fine if you don't want to go to class by reading the book. Programming assignments are NOT explained well at all, so you spend hours just figuring out what to do. Otherwise a good class.
