I learned a lot from Dr. Bernard.   Great teacher.  I would not be where I am today without his help.
Very cool. Taught me in a class by myself for a whole semester.
Teaches by example, so you'll never have an y shortage of examples to study from or refer to in the progressively longer and more complicated programs. Tests are straightforward. Transferring? Hope he ends up at your school.
I really can't add much more then what has been said. He is a great teacher. At times he can be a little boring but you do learn from him. His test are somewhat easy, but can still take some thought in them. Also I thought the programs were easy but once again took some thought in doing them.
Prof. Benard, while his class is a bit long at times, is the man.  He is extremely helpful, always gets back to emails in a super-timely manner, and is extremely knowledgable.  He's great to have over the entire dept.  He will be missed once EECS is gone.  Oh!  And he pecks when he types.  Could it get any better?
Very good teacher, he gives out plenty examples, so the book is unnecessary, and the hardest part is the assignments which take progressively more time, about 16 hours for the last one. He is extremely fast in helping out.
Prof. Benard's CPSC course is graded very leniently.  He is an extremely helpful professor and gets his agenda done.  Any questions are promptly responded to and he keeps on top of things.  The tests were very reasonable and the best you can hope for.  I learned a lot from the course.  A+.
