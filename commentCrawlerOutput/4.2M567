Dr. Fogarty has a reputation as one of the hardest professors in the department, but don't let that deter you from taking his classes. He's a very passionate lecturer and extremely knowledgeable. You'll have to work hard for it if you want an A, but you'll learn a ton along the way.
One of the greatest professors I've had at Trinity. I've learned more from his courses than in 90% of the rest of my college education.  If you work very hard, you will get a B+.
Dr. Fogarty is passionate about Logic, but his handwriting is horrendous. Luckily, he recognizes this and will clarify anything that he's half-scrawled onto the board in a frenzy of mathematical proofs and fanaticism. He is very helpful if you ask. Office hours are a must if you expect to get an A.
Fogarty is a nice guy but he's not very good at presenting the material. Practically everyone in the class is a graduating senior, and most of us have never been exposed to programming. That said, we don't have a book to reference (finding info online isn't as easy as it should be), and the homework covers way more than what we learn in class.
Fogarty is a very passionate and lively teacher. You can truly see his love for the subject and teaching every time he lectures. He is new but it is amazing how well he learns and adapts to his environment. He does have a strong persona of academic elitism which can make it hard during office hours but he lectures make up for it.
Take his classes. All of them. He's still pretty fresh out of grad school, so he will occasionally make some mistakes (making tests that aren't really well-weighted, or that require more than the allotted time to finish) but he's very aware of this and always amends them. Extremely helpful, very enthusiastic, great lecturer. Rocks vim like a beast.
He is extremely enthusiastic and helpful and though the weekly homework is challenging, if you start early and visit his office hours then it ends up being manageable and rewarding.
Dr. Fogarty is pretty awesome. He is always willing to help and  never makes you feel stupid when he answers your questions. Extremely helpful and understanding.
