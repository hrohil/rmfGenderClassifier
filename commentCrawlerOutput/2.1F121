very nice. a little out of it. tries very hard to make sure everyone understands. reviews old material. sometimes assignments and tests were too close together. may help to know a little comp sci before. would take her again. tests were actually based on lectures and pretty easy- sometimes too long
This is probably the worst teacher I've ever had, not only at Tulane but in my life.  She always comes to class unprepared and runs out of things to teach, so if you pick up the stuff quickly you can do well, just don't expect to get anything back on time.
Really bad teacher.  Got all A's on tests but ended up with a B average.  How the hell does that work???  Not helpful at all, decieving, and misleading.  She will give you the impression that you have an A and tell you in the end that you have a B.  No +/- system.  DO NOT TAKE HER!
I didn't understand a single thing that went on in that class. She knows her stuff, but can't teach beginners. It is possible to get an A test average and still get a B in the class. Not sure how that happens, but watch out. Also, she doesn't do the +/- grading system.
Unclear and generally useless.
