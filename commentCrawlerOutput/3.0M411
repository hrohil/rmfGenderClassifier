Sunderam is a pretty nice professor! He is not the best lecturer but pretty lenient when it comes to grading. The midterm and the final were really hard but he curved them quite a lot.
Somewhat below average. Sunderam is not an engaging lecturer, although he does try his best to explain difficult concepts in a more understandable way. Lectures/powerpoint slides are dry and his office hours are useless, but that's really what you would expect from a CS professor. Not the best option for CS 171, but certainly not the worst either.
He kept asking people syntax related questions, saying that he mixes up Java with other programming languages. Not very helpful in office hours, and I have to email him several times to get a reply.
