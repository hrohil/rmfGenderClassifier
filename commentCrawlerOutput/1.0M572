Dr. Boland's idea of teaching is basically reading from a power point, copy and pasting code as a "demonstration," and genuinely getting confused about why the code doesn't work. His tests include the most obscure and unimportant topics covered in the class. Do not take this class with him.
I have never had extreme difficulty with any class whatsoever, never made anything lower than a B, and certainly never felt like I have learned absolutely nothing from a professor. Then everything changed when I took Ed Boland's class. Unhelpful professor, shame that taking his class is required for engineers, take an equivalent course elsewhere!
