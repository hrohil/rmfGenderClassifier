Great teacher.  Makes complex things comprehensible, helps you *really* understand them to a satisfying extent.  His lectures are much clearer than the original papers they describe.   He's to computational biology what Mike Sipser is to complexity theory.  Things from his course have proved useful in my work.  Problem sets can be quite hard.

Good and not too difficult
knows the material really well, is quite enthusiastic, and is very smart! great prof.
He's not going to give you a free ride, but he's a good teacher and if you ask for help he's more than happy to give it.  Interesting.  Kind of a hottie.

in a world of his own, doesn't care about students or teaching although he tries very hard in the first few days to make it seem so.
