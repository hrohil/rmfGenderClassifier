He makes you feel stupid.  He tries to explain things and it comes out condescending.  He plays favorites.  He has little faith in students. I passed the course by pestering him constantly till he found a way to make me understand the material.  Avoid him if you can, any Mudd prof is better.
This class took getting used to but eventually it became fairly enjoyable.  Prof Aaron rules the discussion in class and it is tough for the students to ever be right.  He is, however, a very fair grader and the workload is far less than burdensome.
