good
Margo is a gem. She truly seemed to care about the class. When I struggled in Multivariable Calculus she was always willing to sit down and walk me through problems. I can only hope I encounter more professors as interesting, interested, and sweet as Professor Levine.
Probably one of the most boring classes I've taken at Harvard. Margo is great, though. She did the best she could with the material at hand. She's very busy, but means well.
Sadist!
An excellent professor!
