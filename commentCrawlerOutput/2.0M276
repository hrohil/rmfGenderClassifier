Good lecturer if you're super into CS.  Not very good at all if you're not. I don't think I understood the basics well enough to even start asking questions that he would answer effectively.  I performed poorly on the only test of the semester and he made no effort to reach out, I had to do it myself.  Do NOT recommend to non-cs majors.
