Good lecturer - clearly passionate about what he is teaching. He definitely knows the topic well, which is why it might be hard for him to teach "easier" courses since he often does a deep dive. But if you ask questions and proactively learn, you will gain a lot from his classes.
Worst lecturer ever. It is hard for this condescending makeup artist knows little about cs to to teach in the science and in general. He is a dictatorial aloof. Don't take his class, you will have his smirk and bs. All the above is an understatement. A real PhD is taking up his position as lecturer. Value your time and money. Avoid at all cost.
