Suggest you not take course from him. Too many time-consuming projects without clear explanation. The man also teaches almost all CS courses, which made he not specialized in any field of his courses. You will learn your subjects much better from some free online courses.
I topped his class. Yet, I did not learn any thin new. Not Helpful at all. Very poor Accent. Ridiculously time consuming assignments. It is waste of money and credit.  Teaches only level 1 to level 4.
Tried to cover a lot of ground. When you have questions he is very helpful and very quick to respond. I am amazed to see how flexible he is.1) he agreed to change the order of lessons as many students wanted a different topic than the order he mentioned. He gladly changed the order.2) People wanted project instead of final, he was ok with that too.
Very good professor and passionate in teaching.
Pros: Prof is personable - tells interesting stories and is reasonable with final grades (mostly A/A-) Cons: difficult to learn because there was no consistency between hw and textbook. prof pulls often unrelated questions from other textbooks for hw. first prog assignment too difficult- should not be assigned on first day of class.
Easily one of the top 3 of my favorite professors at Santa Clara University. I used his project documentation template to do my masters thesis, and it helped me quite a bit. His rich experience, and indepth knowledge in the subjects he teaches is amazing. Would recommend him hands down!
I think Dr. Wang is one of the best professors in CS department. He is very knowledgable and gave lots of useful information during in class, also he gave programming projiects, which is very useful to improve programming techniques.
