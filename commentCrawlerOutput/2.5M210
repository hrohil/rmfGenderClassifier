Like the other commenter I felt Dr. Eaton's lectures were okay, yet other students didn't think they were worthwhile and ended up skipping them. However, I felt Dr. Eaton was unapproachable after class and felt like you were bothering him if you asked questions, even though he said he welcomed them. The class had incredibly difficult tests.
Dr. Eaton is good at lecturing, conveying his ideas clearly. However, after class, especially when dealing with students' feedback, I don't think he is responsible enough, and is kind of arrogant, sticking to his own opinion and not really hearing from students. Overall, I think Dr. Eaton is good as a lecturer, but not so good as a professor.
