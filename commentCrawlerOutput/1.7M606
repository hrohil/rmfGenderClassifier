Don't take his class, He doesn't follow syllabus and Assigns a homework which is not related to the course work.
Don't take his classes if not mandatory
Don't take this class until and unless you have to. Avoid him at all cost. He is just a terrible human being if you consider him one.
He's very demanding but does little to help you succeed. Covers SO MANY concepts but doesn't give related HW for practice. Just gives very complicated projects that may or may not be related to what he's teaching. Will have 6/7 lecture PPTs and up to 10 design pattern PPTs as materials to review for an exam. You have no idea what will be tested.
Doesn't follow syllabus; provides no exam review; assigns ridiculously long homework; wings his lectures - disorganized, confusing, scribbles all over white board; assigns textbook but doesn't use it;
His lectures consists of scribbles of non-scene on the board. About 10% of the lectures are on the test. The rest he says will "help" you on your project. He doesn't seem to have a good understanding of his own materials except for testing. Study the slides for the test.
I actually enjoyed his class and liked his grading style: a mixture between tests and projects. What he taught was very similar to what I learned at my internship, so I know the info is useful. He can be abrasive, but I've noticed that he is fair.
Avoid him. Seriously!!!
