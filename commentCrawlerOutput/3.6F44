While she genuinely cares and wants us to succeed, and does a decent job of explaining concepts, when a student has a question or is confused, Amy's response is generally just increasing her volume, rather than addressing the question.
Had to email multiple times, never received an email response. Decent lecturer but otherwise is hands off about course. Does not grade anything. Structures class harshly in attempts to avoid cheating
She is extremely clear and knows the material well. Does not tolerate stupid questions in a huge lecture format, which is excellent but might turn some people off.
Seemed very sharp and was very well-versed in the material being taught, in general. She could have paced lectures better, and the backbone of the class is really the TA staff, but the class is definitely worth taking. Her lectures were very engaging, and I got the impression that she does try to get to know students better.
Knew her stuff, incredibly smart, and makes good use of color mixed with explanation. She expects a lot out of her students, but generally gets it.
I loved this class
