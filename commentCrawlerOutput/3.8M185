Bruce is a spectacular guy, and a good instructor. I can assure you that everyone giving him a poor rating tried to jerk him around. He has been doing this for as long as most of his students have been alive, and he can smell your BS from a mile away. Be straight with him, don't wait for the last minute to tell him something, and do your share.
Pretty cool in general, but he's a very unfair grader. A lot of people bust their ass in senior project and get subpar grades because of team issues or simply because his grading is too tough.
I probably learned more things useful to my software engineering career in his class than I did in any other class in CS.
Good guy and good with mediation.  Unfortunately with my project I had to find this out first hand.  This class is all about your team first, then the project.  If you pick well you will have a great time and learn a lot.
