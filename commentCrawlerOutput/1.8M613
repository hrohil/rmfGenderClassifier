Do not take this class with him. Absolutely rubbish. What he teaches is completely useless and he yells at people all the time. If you make a slight mistake during the lab, you lose a lot of points. You do not want to get yelled at by learning useless things.
I would not recommend taking this guy. He grades hard and demands that all labs are done before the actual lab session. All your code must be done the way he wants it to be done, with no variation, otherwise you lose points. Also hard to understand due to language barrier and you lose 1% of grade for every absence after the first.
Don't take this guy, you'll regret it so much. He doesn't know how to teach, and has on multiple occasions yelled at someone like a drill Sargent for not understanding the lecture. He has a lot of weird made up concepts that don't actually exist in the real world. Overall 0/10. Don't take him!
Don't take this guy. Will grade hard and teach very little. If you want to learn, just google everything and read the lecture notes (all of which will be on blackboard anyway). If you have to take this guy, just download the slides and get ready to teach yourself.
He does not teach during class. He emails you notes and simply READS FROM THE NOTES during class. There is no point in going because he does not take attendance. Programming assignments are easy. He designs the tests to be trick questions.... overall you teach yourself
His teaching style is a little different, but he is an amazing professor. He knows what he is teaching very well but does have some trouble getting his point across due to a language barrier. Due to the nature of Computer Science he wants things to be perfect and expects that of his students. Make sure to participate and you will learn.
