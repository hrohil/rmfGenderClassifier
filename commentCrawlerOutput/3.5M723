Professor Elangovan is a new professor, so there are still some kinks in his teaching and lesson plans that need to be ironed out. Beware of surprise questions on tests (things that weren't on review sheets) every once in a while, but overall a very nice person who just needs to spend some more time in the field to get used to teaching entry level.
He's a great guy and definitely cares about how you're doing in his class. Put a mediocre amount of work in, show up, and pay attention you'll get an A. He's helpful in office hours too. He makes a syntax mistake here and there and this sometimes confuses people but he'll quickly correct himself and clear it up for everyone. Text book is free too.
