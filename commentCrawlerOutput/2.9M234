He tries his best, but is sometimes feels like he is not on task. Biggest issue is preparing students for exams across the board. Very big difference between how people in other intro to computer science classes performed.
Not the best teacher for intro to comp sci but he still tries his best. This was his first time teaching an intro class so it is okay. He started to improve near the end of the semester.
Really hard to follow and doesn't know how to teach what we need to know for exams. It makes it harder when he isn't making the test himself.
Really fun material, good guy, at times can be a little scatterbrained, but in general good guy.
