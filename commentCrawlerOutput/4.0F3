Excellent Professor that does not suffer fools gladly.
I must say CS228 was way over my head and I decided not to do AI as a field based on the class. The weekly assignments took 8-9 days to do on average (at least to my team). From what I could gather (before dropping the class) Daphne is a decent teacher for people who have the brainpower and background to follow her.
Daphne is awesome. She likes what she does, and makes you like it too! By the way, I think she's hot too ;)
Friendly but deadly.
clear teaching style but tendency to drastically overload coursework.
Makes her course interesting
The bottom line is you learn a lot.
