I took the course in the fall, 2018. I have to say he is one of the best professors in SCU or in my life. You may feel his lectures were filled with mathematical notations but to be honest, they are just the basic or the foundation of Machine Learning or Data Mining. When I do research in SCU, the mathematics are much harder than this one.
His classes were confusing sometimes. Without previous knowledge, it's hard to understand what he was saying. You need to do a lot of preview work before every class. And also need to put a lot of efforts in the project.
I cannot understand what he said in the class. He yielded to you if you asked questions because he thought they were easy. The exams are heavily mathematical-based and hard. If you are not good at math, avoid his course and take other practical one. Other Data mining professor teaches more practical. Average score of the class is B-. Very low!
Range of topics covered by him are interesting, however, its hard to understand what he is trying to explain. If you are not familiar with the concept previously then you need to work very hard in his class.
Don't miss this if you are interested in Data Mining and Machine learning.
Great prof. Gives in depth details of each topic. Tries to cover most of the relevant topics needed for industrial exposure. The assignments are good.
Very good prof! One of the few good learning grad courses.
