Love her!! Great during lecture and super helpful during lab.  She gets everything across very well and is just repetitive enough.  She is also super friendly and an overall engaging professor.  10/10 would recommend.
Professor Chambers is great, she's just relatively new to teaching and is still figuring out her style. She engages well with the class, and is readily available in office hours any day of the week. Very tough grader.
