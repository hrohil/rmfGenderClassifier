Dr. Fetrow is a tough grader. You need to be an expert in writing to get a good grade. To make things worse, she cannot clearly explain requirement for writing assignment. You may get a C-D if you misunderstand rubric. She is a nice person, though. If you ask for help, she's willing to help you. But she is always too busy to make appointment.
RUN!!!! Too busy to help. Disorganized.
