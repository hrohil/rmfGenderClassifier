Was a bit nervous at first, but he turned out to be a great teacher. Definitely try to understand the content, because the tests are very difficult.
Amazing Professor. Though his classes are challenging, you will get a lot of things out of it
One of the best professors I've ever had. Always made sure everyone understood the material before moving on. Great at explaining very complex concepts. Just an overall nice guy.
Awesomeness!
He taught very well and answer all questions. His style is very motivating. However, he's always 5-10 minutes late and he didn't have office hour. Moreover, I'd never get my homework graded. Overall, he is very good for at least you don't have to get back home and read because I'll almost understand everything in class!
Very good...It doesn't seem like it's an honor course...you get every thing right in the class :). And very nice teacher.
