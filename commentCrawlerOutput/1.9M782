This class is very difficult, the homework isn't mandatory but if you don't do the homework you will not get a good grade. There are a lot of valuable resources outside of the classroom that everyone should take advantage of. People mistake this professor for being "terrible" because the class (CSE 101) is difficult.
Nice guy, always was willing to help out. Unfortunately, course was incredibly difficult and specific for no reason. Incredibly fast at teaching class because he is the course instructor, and not a TA. Would not recommend taking at MSU, you will get PTSD
This class is hard for no reason, but it is meant to differentiate business students who are applying to broad.
This class is horrible. The grading scale is ridiculous.  The quizzes have 3 problems and if you miss one you automatically fail the quiz. Don't even get me started on the exams. Kevin wants you to email your ta instead of him for help, but the tas are all students and half the time they are in class or working and can'take answer your questions.
This class is incredibly hard for no reason. The class itself has a 44% success rate which is absolutely absurd on the universities part and it really says something about how this class is instructed. Kevin talks down on you and is not understanding at all.  Avoid taking CSE 101 through MSU at all costs, you will not pass.
This is the worst class I have ever taken. It is unnecessarily hard. Class and notes do not prepare you for meticulously graded HW, quizzes, and exams. Homework takes over three hours, quizzes are very tough, and exams make you want to pull hair out. I am a hardworking student that has a high GPA, but this class surely took its toll.
Terrible Course overall, the grading of exams and quizzes are just horrible
