Worst CS professor I've had. Uses a large curve to compensate for his inability to teach or speak clear English.
Difficult class.  Class average on the tests ranged between 55-65 for all.  HW is 40 percent of grade though
3 programming assignments, 1 test, and a project worth 50% of your grade.  An easy grader on everything except for the final deliverables on the project.  I'm slightly retarded at C++ and ended up with a 92, but he gives a nice curve (A was 90-100).  Bonus project worth up to 10% extra. attendance never taken
You will have to read to understand sometimes, and it can be hard to understand what he is saying, but if you go to office hours he will be very helpful and you will get your work done. You will come out with a deep knowledge of C++
somewhat hard to understand in class. book is extremely helpful in determining code, but if you go to office hours he is really helpful. i didn't go to class for a month and still got an A. big grade curve he defines at beginning of class. tests are difficult but not overly taxing.
