Words things in a way that makes even the most simplest of statements seem as though they are PhD level. He loves what he teaches about though and that shows.
Writing review  in 2016, after taking 2 course with Danny in 2002 &amp; 2003.  Great Guy, and don't know if he still teaches.  He taught me the foundation on which my career is based.  Thanks  Danny.

Strange guy. Very easy to get along with, you must know your stuff to do well in his class, but he is willing to help.
