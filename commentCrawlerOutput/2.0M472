An unlikable person at best, and terrible at teaching at worst. He is the chair and really couldn't care less to make an effort to actually instruct his students and, as another post mentioned, he can get away with it. Avoid.
Jeffay is a really smart guy and can in great detail answer any questions you may have. The class was flipped which sucks because you have to at least watch an hours worth of videos before each class to do well. Extremely tough grader. You can be right, but Jeffay wants HIS answers and will give you half credit for textbook answers on exams.
Professor Jeffay's classroom is flipped, and so you must watch hours of videos each week while you simply do problems with your neighbors during lecture. The programming assignments are time-consuming, and he will give you a 0 for a single minor mistake. Do not take this class if you want an effective learning environment in exchange for tuition.
He is a very hard teacher, but if you do, literally everything he says to do, you will get an A.
I like this class content but it was so frustrating. It was flipped classroom and lectures were useless. There was barely any partial credit in the tests and the homework takes a long time to do even if it counts for so little of your grade. The midterm and final were one of the hardest tests I've taken in my life. If you're reading this, stay away
Hard teacher for people who don't go to class, but pretty easy overall if you actually do the work unlike these other raters.
Don't do this to yourself. He is inaccessible outside of class, or if you do get a hold of him, he is snarky and cruel to the point of being offensive. As the department head, he can do what he wants, and he knows it. Lectures are totally useless, he doesn't lecture at all during class. Hours and hours of flipped lectures instead.
Jeffay had a completely flipped classroom (he did NOT lecture at all in class) and made you watch hours upon hours of YouTube videos instead -- outside of class. He had us do "worksheets" in class that were not for a grade, but he didn't give us the answers to them. Exams are extremely hard. I've never preformed so poorly in a COMP class.
