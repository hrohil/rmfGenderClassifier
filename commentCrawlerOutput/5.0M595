Great guy. Would take again.
Dr. Perkins made Discrete interesting and he wants to help you. Although the material may seem sporadic and not connected, he goes over exactly what you need to know for quizzes and tests. Go to his office hours! He is super helpful and is ready to help you with any concept you don't get. 10/10 would take again.
Dr. Perkins makes a class like Discrete understandable.  Discrete should be broken up into multiple courses, just because of the breadth of material and seeming lack of connectivity between the outrageous amount of concepts thrown at you. Dr. Perkins is very accessible outside of class - take advantage. Lenient grader, but content is difficult.
