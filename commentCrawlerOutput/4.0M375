He is really nice. Go find him in his office hour. He will give you direction in your homework.
Definitely the hardest class I've taken. Prof Agarwal is organized and clearly knows the material very well, but lectures are still complicated due to difficulty of the material. Lots of supplemental readings. Nearly all homework and exam questions are difficult. Be prepared to work very hard, especially if you don't have a strong math background.
Dude is absolutely brilliant. Doesn't bother using notes for his lectures because he understands the material so well.  Tests are ridiculously hard, but this class is always hard. Hires amazing TAs. You will learn from a master if you take his class.
Agarwal is brilliant. He has such a good understanding of Algorithms that he doesn't use notes for any of his lectures. Gives lots of supplementary readings to help us understand. Very organized lectures. Makes the TAs attend the lectures to ensure recitations are on point. BUT the class content and tests are very difficult. Class is curved.
possibly the most difficult class I have ever taken as CS major. irritatingly unhelpful professor (if you are stuck on a problem, he will give you a hint but usually the hint isn't enough to get you past being stuck). doesn't provide answers to textbook problems, so doing problems is often frustrating and time-consuming.
Class is hard, regardless of the professor teaching it. Do as many problems as possible. Pankaj is nice and helpful but this material is just difficult.
