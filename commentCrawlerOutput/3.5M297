Shapiro goes above and beyond to help his students understand the lengthy and difficult text he assigns. While his classes are difficult due to his subject matter, he grades fairly and always gives helpful praise and criticism to strengthen students ideas. He has genuine care and concern for his students and their comprehension of class material
*AVOID AT ALL COSTS*  Or rather, sit in on his lectures, but NEVER take his class.  This guy is beyond disorganized, but my biggest issue is that he treats his students like garbage.  At one point he even posted fake lecture recordings to through of the ones who didn't come to class.  On the bright side, he's brilliant, knowledgeable, and funny.
Great material, great lecturer, _awful_ professor.  Totally disorganized, barely ever around for assistance.  Assignments left much to be desired in the way of explanation.  Assumptions made by students would lead to points off.
This guy is absolutely hilarious! He combines enough humor to make you pay attention, but still gives you all the info you need. His sarcasm makes the class fun, but not too much that you get bored. Not only that, this guy is brilliant.
