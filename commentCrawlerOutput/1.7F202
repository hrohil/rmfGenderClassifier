She tries to help and she is very nice, but its easier if you teach yourself than going to her lectures, which are a waste of time.
She knows her stuff, but has no idea how to teach. Easy labs with overly difficult projects. Learn to love your TA because they are the only ones who can save you in this class.
I'm surprised to see people rate this professor so low! i took cse231 with her and didn't have a clue and got a 2.5 this is a weed out class .. basically this will give you a taste of what the Comp. Sci major has to offer. The professor is extremely helpful and fair (btw she's the dean now!)
I had a hard time with this class, and the prof wasn't very compassionate, especially with "computer errors".
Very unclear professor who does not know how to teach.
