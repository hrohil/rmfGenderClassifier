She's a really good professor. The class content was definitely difficult, but she provides most of the information required in the lecture; the textbook recommended is somewhat confusing but you MUST practice the skills that she teaches, elsewise you will not pass. Going to her office hours really helps, and she's a really good teacher. A+++ prof.
Professor Moallem is excellent. She expains content thoroughly, slowly, and is very patient. She will answer questions without getting irritated, is easy to reach outside of the classroom, and will work with you if you run into any trouble. Definitely pay attention to due dates though, putting things off for this class will not work.
Golnaz Moallem taught circuits well and clearly laid out the concepts in class, doing plenty of examples. The homework wants to rip out your esophagus and drive it through your anus. The tests are a warm and gentle caress, softly whispering words of love into your ear. Be diligent to do the homework and the tests will be very straightforward.
Awful teacher. She didn't know the subject until near the very end of the semester, her lectures were sparse and read off of a powerpoint with very little sensible explanation, and her passive aggressive method of talking about homework and quizzes got old quickly. She does not know how to hold attention, and she simply doesn't know how to teach.
You cant understand anything she says and her voice is really annoying. You will want to skip class everyday. The projects are also assigned without giving proper guidance. She also gave us a long homework and project to work on during spring break and didnt give anything when we were free. Please avoid this class for your own good
