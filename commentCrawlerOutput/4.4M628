Super cool guy. I took him online for a IT Strategy class and thought his lectures were relevant based on his experience and the HW assignments were challenging yet if you put in the time, energy, thought you will be fine.  I would for sure take his class again.
One of the most engaged Professors.  He puts a lot of information into his lecture slides.  Very engaged in the topic of IT strategy.  The  book material is dry.  Plan on reading and writing a lot in this course.  Also, the exams require you to attend the lectures and complete the assignments.  Not much feedback on exams and papers.
I really enjoyed the class and the principles we discussed are very applicable to the IT industry.  He's got great experience and has passion for the topic.
Pretty clear lecture and easy to understand... Submit Home works in time and you will be all right.
