Low grader: I got a 79.45 course average and he gave me a C not a B. However, he is the smartest professor I know when it comes to business and computer science. I recommend him even though he grades on the low side.
Good professor. Knows his stuff. Very knowledgeable. Exams are difficult. Gives lots of homework but not enough time during class to go over it. Takes attendance and marks you absent if 15 minutes late.
Great professor. He teaches the material clearly. He knows his stuff very well. Makes you work hard for your grade. If you have an 89 average he will give you a B, not an A. If you miss a class you really miss a lot. Can't slack off in his class.
Excellent professor, knows his stuff, gives hard tests
