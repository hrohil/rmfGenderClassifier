Such a hidden gem in the department. Prof Toma pushes students to become better computer scientists. She really cares how students do and tries her best to make sure her students learn. I really love her! probably my favorite professor at bowdoin!
Labs are hard, but she's an easy grader. Classes can be somewhat dry, but cares about materials, and the labs are really interesting.
Really warm person and a great teacher. Sometimes confusing, but is sure to help you with whatever you need.
Sorry I took her class. She does not understand/like java and was terrible help with the programming. She'd just fix my problems without helping me figure out how to fix them for myself. The class was easy but the labs were pretty hard. If you feel very confident that you will be able to do labs without prof help, take w/her, otherwise AVOID her!
Sometimes the class was a little slow, but I did learn a lot. Not to difficult if you're familiar with computers to begin with.
She was very helpful outside of class. The workload in 107 is not very heavy.  She always cleared up any questions I had and was always available.
Awesome prof.  Excellent at helping students understand the material.  Always available for help.
Reasonably bad.
She is the least helpful professor that I have has as a student at Bowdoin. She is very impaitent when it comes to helping a student. She perfers quick questions,or you could ask the TA. She is not aware that some students do not understand what is going on. If you take this class take S. Majerick.
