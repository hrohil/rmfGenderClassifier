Lanie is a wonderful professor. She makes computer science an incredibly approachable topic that anyone can take. Comp11 is an amazing class and I would highly recommend!
Her classes are all incredibly straight forward. I've had her for both COMP11 and COMP61 and both have been easy A's. Her exams require nearly no studying and she is an incredibly easy grader.
Laney is super compassionate and approachable. The homework can be oppressive sometimes, so DON'T procrastinate! I learned a LOT, though I often found her lectures to be confusing when I didn't read the textbook beforehand. Do the reading and do your homework, and you'll be more than fine! The extra credit is nice to have but not necessary for an A
Amazing class. Took the same class with Duchin last semester and dropped it after failing the first two midterms. Took this class this semester and got an A+ on both midterms. Super easy grading and very friendly. Definitely take Discrete Math with Laney Strange no one else.
Some people had trouble grasping concepts and some things were passed over quickly, but I enjoyed the class. The homework is challenging but rewarding. You'll be fine if you manage your time well. Laney is extremely approachable and caring. Lectures are not important if you read the textbook or have prior knowledge
Dr. Strange's COMP11 is everything it should be. She never over-complicates the material and provides helpful visual examples for understanding concepts. She's extremely approachable and includes all lecture resources online for remote access. The class environment is really supportive. HW is challenging but doable. Definitely recommend taking!!!
Homework is all that matters in this class. She tries to teach but a lot of times it's really hard to comprehend what she's teaching in lecture. Most people don't read the "required" textbooks, but the homework and tests are very doable if you just put in enough effort. Take it, but don't expect to learn a lot from her.
Dr. Strange is kinda new to Tufts, but she's a fantastic lecturer. She's very kind and is very engaging for a giant lecture class like comp11, and she solidified my choice to major in computer science. I read the textbook, but you can get by easily without it and she never relied on it. Take this class with her!! You won't regret it.
