She knows what she's talking about and is passionate about CS, but she is a little bit nit-picky about things like code style.
When you ask her a question she seems very eager to finish answering your question so that she can move onto other more important things, even if it means that she doesn't do a good job answering the question. Often her answers and extremely brief, vague, and not helpful. She makes many mistakes during lecture which makes the class hard to follow.
I took this class over the summer and it was one of most useful classes. Although I am not a JHU student, I found this class to be very interesting and helpful in understanding programing. It is a tough class when taken in summer, but it's rewarding.
I found that often the professor was not as familiar with the material as she should be. She also does a horrible job at explaining concepts to the class. She teaches her intro classes at a much harder level then it should be.
She is a very good professor. I really learned a lot from her.
