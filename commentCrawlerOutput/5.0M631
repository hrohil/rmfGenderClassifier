Having never taken a class with Prof K I was a bit uneasy. However once classes started I felt so welcome and never wanted to miss a single minute of his class. Prof K is one of the most interesting intellectuals I have ever met at ND or any other school.His breadth of knowledge is only surpassed by his caring attitude towards his students success.
Undoubtedly one of the finest, kindness, most compassionate human beings God ever placed on the face of the earth. Dr. K not only taught me CIS/PHOTOSHOP he taught me patience, understanding, and self confidence. Dr. K is one of the best Prof's that UND students will ever have had the opportunity with which to study. Dr. K is the best ever.
Prof K is not only 1 of the best prof's at ND but also one of the kindest, considerate and caring human beings ever. He provides his home phone # and tells students they may call him 24/7 should they ever require his assistance even once the course is complete. Prof K  should be the standard by which all Prof's are judged.
Prof K is the best prof I have had at ND. He is patient, understanding, with knowledge beyond belief. One of the few Prof's that genuinely cares about his students. He assisted me on many occasions and even drove from Chicago on his days off to assist his students. He was the most exceptional Prof at Notre Dame. Sadly he retired; a big loss for ND.
I did'nt fully realize either the depth or breadth of Prof. Kadlubowski's knowledge on this very difficult subject matter until my graduation from UND. Aside of his knowledge, PROF K. would meet any studnet at any time of day or night to assist in their understading of a particular lesson. The subject matter wasdifficult, but hemade class time fun
When God brought Michael to Notre Dame we were sent an angel. EXCEPTIONAL PROF with knowledge beyond compare. Assistance provided to students is unmatched even at the Golden Dome. Helpful regardless of the simplicity of complexity of the question asked. I was saddend to learn that Michael retired from UND. He was/is the best there ever was!
