I did learn in the class, she is not a bad lecturer, but she is unsupportive. She did not display empathy, and was intensely callous.
She has challenging tests and lots of people complain about it but she is a great prof.
Sneha is a decent lecturer at best. She is brutally strict with deadlines, not making exceptions for even the most extreme circumstances(i.e. Family emergencies, injuries). Exams are strenuous, and you are benefitted from not even trying difficult questions because you can only re-do for half credit questions you didn't get any partial credit on.
