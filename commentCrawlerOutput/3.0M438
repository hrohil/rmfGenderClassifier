One of the nicest men I've met. Fantastic format for the class: 1 assignmentweek, with 1 huge paper due at end of the term. No final, no tests.  The students here who complain about him are definitely texting, surfing internet, etc in class. He teaches tough, concepts classes, and you gotta pay close attention to him and take good notes to do well
I got a solid introduction to data structures and object oriented programming from Salan, and it prepared me very well for industry internships. His tests were difficult but were a good mix of code and theoretical situations, and I struggled with the midterm. Once I got used to his test format I did well and ended up with an A on the final.
Not an interesting lecturer. I had trouble because assignment handouts were eiter nonexistent, or missing crucial information given only in lecture. I had no reference to verify that I had done it right. It's my own fault waiting until the last minute so I couldn't just ask him--so if you take him don't make that mistake yourself.
Wasn't particularly clear or detailed while explaining concepts. Occasionally wasn't able to figure something out himself. He would try to explain things until you got them if you asked questions though. Tests were harder than expected and not easy to prepare for.
