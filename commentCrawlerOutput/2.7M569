He was by far the worst professor I ever had.  Total wase of my time and money.  I am actually dumber after taking his class.
This isn't a real class but I had the "honor" of hearing him lecture a few times.....BOOOOORING!  He takes a long time to explain himself, he tells some good stories, but he gets off topic and slows down the pace of the class a lot.  Don't take him in the morning, cause you'll fall back asleep!
Forced to take him again, I once again regretted it. For the truth, take every comment in the below 555 rating and invert it. Will never take him again for any reason.
This guy is so freaking cool. He's one of the smartest profs at trinity. He always has funny stories and quotes, like "sometimes we wish microsoft didn't leave us in the middle of the road with a stalled computer, so to speak"
never ask this man a question unless you have cleared your schedule for the next three hours.  very monotone, very boring. not too clear on what will be tested over
Wow, beware this prof. Feels like he gave up ten years ago.
