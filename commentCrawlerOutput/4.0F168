She is a really nice prof and is really energetic, which can get a little annoying early in the morning. She is willing to help outside of class, and she gives a lot of partial credit on quizzes and exams.
Davis is awesome. Really. She's really interested in her students. And is available to answer your questions outside class. Great prof!!
Good at explaining and very willing to help students in and out of class. She really takes a personal interest in her students' success. The only problem was that she didn't always know what she was asking with assignments someone else had written. Once she is more comfortable with the course materials she will really be a great prof.

Davis is such a nice person. She is incredible at teaching. Yes, there are concepts that are very hard to understand but it's due to the subject. She'll talk to you outside of class until you get it and re-work the course's schedule to set aside more time on a hard concept that the class is confused on. Definitely take her. All exams are take-home.
