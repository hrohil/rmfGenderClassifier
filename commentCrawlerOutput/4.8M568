The class was pretty difficult, but Dr. Hibbs is very accessible outside of class and is more than willing to help. I wouldn't recommend the class, but I would recommend taking a class with Dr. Hibbs if you get the chance
Dr. Hibbs tries his best to make CompSci easy for all his students. It is a really hard topic, but he does a good job explaining it. Homework is super hard and takes longer than expected. You have to study for everything. He is super accessible outside of class and SUPER helpful. If I had to take CompSci again, I would take it with him.
They said I was crazy for taking Intro Comp Sci as my digital literacy credit for pathways. Luckily, there were obviously fairies at Dr. Hibbs' birth that blessed him with the gift of teaching computer science. Got an A- and wasn't bored out of my mind, like my friends that took Essential Info Technology for the credit.
Dr. Hibbs could practically teach anyone how to code!
Great professor. Always available in office hours (though sometimes it gets backed up since his office hours are in high demand)
He's a beautiful teaching butterfly that wants to see you succeed more than anything
Hibbs is a wonderful, new professor. He really goes out of his way to make himself available and provide a "human" element to his teaching. He just doesn't give lectures and leave you out to die, he actively (beggingly) interacts with his students for a deeper experience.
He's a nice guy and class isn't terribly dull, but his tests are  different from the review sheets. Be wary and study well.
