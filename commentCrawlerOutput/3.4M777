It's rare to find a professor that actually cares about the subject as much as he does.  He puts a lot of time into preparing incredible slideshows and assignments and even held emergency work sessions every Sunday evening.  He's a pro at compilers, and you'll learn so much from the class.  He can't help you fix bugs, but nobody can anyways.
Dybvig is the man. If you want to learn about computers he is your go to guy. I came into this class knowing nothing and now I am getting job offers from microsoft. Dybvig=success. Not to mention how hot and tempting he is... bottom line take this class!!
Liked the teacher.  He really knows his area.  Lecture can be a little dry. Really challenging assignments. Extremely attractive.
Dybvig is an old pro at Compilers, which I believe is the only class he teaches. He has been doing it for years,  and clearly knows what he is talking about. It isn't an easy class, but any problem you have with it will be due to your own inability, not a problem with how he teaches it.
Very difficult class, but also VERY educational. Didn't go to him for help much, so I can't comment on his willingness to help. If you take this class with him you WILL learn and you WILL write a compiler... or you will fail. Every CS major should take this. Its really a CS right of passage (kind of like taking 335 with Purdom vs. any other prof).

This class sucked!!!! AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!  The only reason I got through the class is because I had a very helpful AI, Dybvig is impossible to understand and unwilling to help...
This is the best class I have ever taken.  He has put so much effort in this class to do it correctly.  It's not an easy class by no means but that doesn't matter so much when the teacher is really got their stuff together.
