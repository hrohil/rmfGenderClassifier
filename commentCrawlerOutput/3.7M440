Hardest guy in the department but fair when comes to grading. EXTREMELY approachable. Sometimes his explanations are not quite clear, but he is unbelievably patient so just keep asking. I took this fundamental class and then I become a CS major...
Professor Stough is very knowledgable, but does a poor job conveying this knowledge to his students. His professor hours are a waste of time and it's better to get a tutor. Don't waste your time with one of his classes unless you have to.
He might seem to act like a bit like a jerk in class, but actually is really nice and knows his subject area really well. He has all his lecture made in power point that you can download and is helpful to anyone who needs help. Great professor, worth taking.
