hard projects for data structure class. effective office hours. Good materials. She was really patient with problems in my project code, even when I snet several emails, she replied kindly and helped me to fix my code, but the projects were really hard.
Her accent was something you had to get used to, and she would mostly read the slides that she puts up in the class. i believe the homeworks were a bit difficult given that this is an introductory CS course, and you would HAVE to pay attention in class if you wanted to do good in the homeworks. Exams were easy if you knew the course content
She was very understanding about our problems and very precise in teaching.
She allows you to look at the lecture powerpoints on Blackboard, and makes sure the tests are easy enough for the class to be able to pass. She even rewrote our final exam to be easier after seeing a low class average on the second exam. She wants everyone to pass, and tries to make sure that can happen.
