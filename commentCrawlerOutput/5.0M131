Took for CS2. Awesome professor, a pleasure to have. He is always happy to help and makes lectures actually interesting. He ties the things you learn daily into the real world with tech news and with connections to programs we use all the time. Prioritizes the things that matter. Textbook reading is assigned but not important compared to programs.
Very clear demonstration. His lecture is fast and clear. You couldn't find anything redundant in his content. Always respond to questions with smartness. A little geeky, but that is what you should expect from a CS prof )
Matthew is awesome! Take his classes!
Computer Science is not a very easy subject to teach. But not only is Matthew one of the most knowledgeable professors I've ever had, but he is also one of the few who can put across his knowledge in his teaching. He is very encouraging, and always patient and helpful. His projects, though frustrating, are always interesting and fun.
Computer Science is so difficult, but matthew is super helpful, patient, and grades relatively easily! Good guy.
Great professor, really helpful, super patient and understanding.
