This professor can answer about half of the questions he is asked in lecture. Normally this would not be an issue, especially given the random questions students can come up with... BUT I've never seen a professor just fold their hands back and wait for another student to answer a very reasonable question before. It feels like he isn't even trying.
Not a great professor. Attendance is expected and he will give out quizzes around once a week. Most of his assignments are easy, but he is extremely boring. Just study his slides, do the homework, and you'll be fine, but be prepared for a solid hour or so of monotonous, unenthusiastic lecturing every time you go to class.
He doesn't explain concepts well, he only points at things and say their names. Homework assignments are very vague so a couple of days before it's due you need to ask him to rewrite it or clarify some parts. He will ask you to do things you haven't learned yet. He has a voice that will put you to sleep.
Boring lecture he basically just reread the textbook. Does not make it easier to understand the material or go in-depth to why we need to know the materials. It also doesnt help that it is hard to understand his accent.
I enjoyed this class and would take this professor for any other course. I understood him and he was very precise on disseminating knowledge to students. Attendance is part of the grade, but if you are taking the class then I would think that individuals should show up if they expect an A.
great teacher. just do assignments and go over previous years tests which he posts and your good to go. gives quizzes in class which are pretty easy so don't miss class
