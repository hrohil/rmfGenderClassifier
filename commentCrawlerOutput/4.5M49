I took his CS42 two years ago. Prof Ben is super enthusiastic and knows the material really well. He is very helpful and solves my problem every time. I learned a lot in his class.
He is a great professor and I would definitely take his class again! But you have to work hard to get an A.
Had him for CS70 too. He's probably my favorite CS prof.
Prof. Ben is enthusiastic in every lecture and incredibly helpful in office hours. Data Structures is a difficult class, but the material is very useful and he is definitely worth it. It's one of the only Mudd classes I would retake again.
Nice prof...
