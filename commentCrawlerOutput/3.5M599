Very relaxed teacher. 1000x better than Jankun-Kelly. Very clear and concise on what he wants from you. When he grades things he's very lenient if you demonstrate you know the material. Would definitely take again
Very laid back guy. He explains concepts to the point where you think you understand them until you get to the lab and are completely lost. Lecture did not focus on coding as much as I would have liked. Tests are not particularly hard, but there is no partial credit. He does give a ton of drop grades, though.
