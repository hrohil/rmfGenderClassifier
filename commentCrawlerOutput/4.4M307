Rich is a very approachable professor. He knows the material pretty well and is able to teach it in a way that makes his class easy to understand.
Great guy. Very nice, approachable and willing to work with you during office hours. Knows his stuff.
While I took Intro to CS and found it be fairly challenging, I went into Rich's office hours regularly and he's incredibly helpful and was willing to sit down with me and reexplain concepts that I had trouble understanding in class.
Rich is wonderful. His lectures are generally clear and he is always willing to help.  Some topics can be slippery and sometimes the presentation/assignments are unclear, but he's always capable and willing to clear things up; he's even offered to ditch lunch to help you out.
Kind of dorky, but fun and he takes things pretty lightly. Knows his stuff.
