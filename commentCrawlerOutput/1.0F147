She is very hard to understand. She does not teach well. I coded something wrong asked for help she came over looked at my code and laughed. I would not recommend her to anyone.
She means well, and she's certainly smart, but she just isn't cut out for teaching. I understand being a GA is not easy, but the class felt lazy more than anything. Her lectures are boring, and her assignments are confusing, though easy. Her quizzes aren't worded well and are difficult, and she is often hard to understand.
