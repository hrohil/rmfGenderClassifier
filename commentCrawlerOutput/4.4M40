Love his baritone voice, explains algorithms very well.
Great professor. Algorithms was very interesting.
EXCELLENT!
Has a decent sense of humor, but is not the clearest speaker or lecturer. Seemed to delegate a lot of the homework problems to GSIs, and it was often frustrating. Tests are not the most well-written ones but are still fair.
Among the best prof. I've ever had. Having access to Christos's brain in office hours is seriously priceless.
excellent
Cool professor who cracks dorkish computer science jokes and teaches pretty well. Taught CS70 with Vazirani and took the backseat, but involved with tests and homeworks.. sometimes questionable practices of finding questions online and assigning them without knowing the answers.

Enthusiastic teacher who keeps the topics interesting.  Homework is hard but worthwhile and tests are fair.
