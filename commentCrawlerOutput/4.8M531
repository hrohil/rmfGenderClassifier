Pretty awesome professor who's funny and pretty nice, but ouch. Jory gets kicks out of asking very hard questions on everything he gives but grade nicely. Homework (LaTeX), programs, and quizzes every week make up 60% of your grade and are very tough and time-consuming. Exams are hard, but 10% apiece. Awesome class, but it'll be a rough semester :)
Dr. Denny is very upfront about the difficultly of the course and his expectations of students. He matches the difficultly with extra credit that is offered for every programming assignment and quiz that is given. The only written test is the midterm (he curved it by 30 points) for me. Content is hard to understand do attendance is a must.
Great teacher. If you want to succeed, then you must go to office hours.
Tough class that he teaches well. Lot of course material, which equals lots of homework. Offers extra credit on all HW, exams, and projects which you'd better do. Curves exams and the final overall grades. The class prepares you well, but is a lot of work; oftentimes feels like a 1.5 or 2 unit class.
Dr. Jory really wants his students to succeed - he makes sure to give us help when we need it, answer our questions (on piazza)  promptly, and gives us challenging yet interesting assignments. His powerpoints are clear and on point. Tests and programming assignments are adequately challenging but not too hard. He offers tons of extra credits too.
Dr. Jory is so nice and genuinely wants his students to succeed. He explains the material so well and is always available to help people outside of class even when its not during his stated office hours. Cares a ton about his students. Definitely would take him again!
Great teacher, would definitely take again
