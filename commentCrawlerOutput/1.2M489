Horrid professor. He cannot communicate to save his life and he mumbles. He even uses a microphone, but I still can't hear him.
No, just no. Take a harder class as long as it is with any other professor.
Avoid this Professor. It's beyond me that this guy still gets the greenlight from the University to be allowed to stand in front of students and attempt to teach. Poor communicator, doesn't even use his own slides, and mumbles to himself during the lectures. Seriously--he's the worst.
