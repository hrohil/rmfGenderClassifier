Ray is an excellent professor. The projects are easy, the lectures are interesting, and the final is also easy. If you've never seen java before there can be a bit of a learning curve, but overall there is no reason not to take this class.
Prof. Essick really knows his stuff! His lectures are quite content heavy and a bit unrelated to the projects, but his enthusiasm for Java is amazing. I would definitely take another class taught by him! Class is graded only on projects and the final exam. He doesn't provide much syntax in class though, so you have to look up a lot.
He is a very smart guy, and you can tell by how much detailed knowledge he has on various fields of computer science despite having an engineering background. The class is graded solely on projects and a final exam. No homework, and you get 2 weeks to complete every project. Class is lecture heavy, but we have interactive ones also.
Professor Essick is incredibly knowledgeable and you can tell he really cares about the material. His energy is contagious, and he makes it very clear that he is interested in doing everything he can to help you be successful.
Professor Essick knows his stuff really really well and is passionate about the topic material. But he's really lecture heavy and they are more abstract and focused on understanding the concepts rather than showing you how to do the actual syntax and code. You'll have to learn all the syntax on your own but you'll conceptually get everything!
