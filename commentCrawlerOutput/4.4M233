He is a great professor.  He may not be the most engaging, but his knowledge of the subject is unparalleled.  Ask questions during his lectures to get the most out of them.  He is very helpful outside of class.
Really nice teacher, very helpful, knows alot about CS.
Fantastic professor and person. He's authored numerous books, but is very down-to-earth. Although the material can be challenging, he makes class fun. He really cares about teaching and his students.
Very good professor but his class can get kind of boring. If you are interested in computer science, he will teach you a lot.
