If you want to become a better student, take any of his courses. He will make sure you understand the material as well as the history behind the material and why it is important. He will make you think critically and accurately about anything you want to say which is a great skill for the future.
I took the course of Theory of Automata and I didn't feel familiar with the content of the course. But thanks to Michael who is an amazing professor and helped me in every way and guided me through, lead me to find the essence in computation. Besides, he's a visionary guy who really see through things. If you work hard, he is willing to help you.
One of the most exceptional professors on campus.  If you're a lazy person, this isn't your teacherclass.  Be ready to dedicate yourself to the course in exchange for a lifelong understanding of knowledge representation in intelligent agents.
When it comes to teaching it and getting the concepts across to his students, he fails. Over half of my class failed this course. He is passionate, but very impatient, very hard to understand, and his test are ridiculously hard. If you don't mind taking the course twice, I recommend this guy
Brilliant professor. Exams are pretty well balanced. He has a somewhat heavy accent, but is open to repeating himself if you have issues understanding him.
