Granted, I took him as a professor after he moved to William and Mary, but we're taught very little about actual code. Conceptually he's fantastic, but we aren't given the tools to actually WRITE the code. Instead we're given demanding projects and expected to just sort of figure it out. I'm quitting Computer Science entirely thanks to his class.
Great teacher. Great person.
Great person. Great Teacher
I went into his course knowing nothing about CS but kind of interested in it. His course is definitely geared toward people who have techy backgrounds or are VERY into CS. His assignments are way harder than they should beâ€¦he teaches the minimum and expects you to complete the maximum. HUGE outside of class time commitment
I went into this class hoping to learn a little bit and get a good grade.Wrongo!Honestly, the class is not too much work outside of class, except for labs.However, just merely understanding the material is a task all in itself.Very challenging material, not clear with teaching or grades and I'm regretting taking the lowest computer science section.
