Dr. Kelley is great when working with you one on one and is a very fair grader. That said, some of the lectures in class can be confusing, but overall I still enjoyed the class.
We did a lot of projects, and most of them are one-person projects. You often need to use some knowledge that did not mentioned on class. Although she is very patient, this class still very hard for me.
Overall great teacher. She is really smart and very good at cs, will help you out with everything if needed, but she can be a little awkward at times. Perfect class for people who know nothing about CS and want to have interest in it. Would take again!
