Really unclear lecturer and not all that helpful when you come in outside class. His instructions are unclear and his homework assignments and lectures do not translate well into tests.
Stuff is hard but he specializes in logic so this is right up his alley. Did not go to class, just read his slides and read the book sections. Thats usually all you needed for homework. Midterm was hard but final was easier. Both are take home. His office hours are great, really helps if you prepared and tried the homework yourself.
Awful lecturer. Fails to cater to beginners by laying out a solid foundation. All we did was make stupid games and he insisted on teaching from a dense, boring and hardly useful textbook that he wrote himself. Offers very little help and assigns a ton of reading for a CS class. This is probably the hardest intro class at pomona, and the worst.
Terrible prof. Do not take. Rude and confusing. Not an enjoyable class
A bad professor who only reads from the textbook (which he wrote). Oftentimes rude. Hear the Mudd course is better; wish I had taken that one.
One of the worst professors at Pomona. Professor does not grade homeworks, tests, midterms himself, instead relying on inconsistent TAs. Not helpful / apparent during office hours. Classes can be skipped if you read the book, but the information is not useful, and is centered around games. Take CS5 a5 Mudd instead. Far superior professor and class.
Great professor! I took a CS intro course before and understood nothing; I learned more during the first week with Bruce than I had learned in an entire semester previously
Great Professor! He is really super nice and available whenever! Class is really interesting and made me want to major in Computer science. Now I'm a cs major. Excellent intro to cs. Highly recommend!
Best CS teacher ever.  Brilliant. Extremely clear explanations, and very helpful. Always cheerful. And knows a lot of interesting random facts. Everyone should try to take a class with him.
