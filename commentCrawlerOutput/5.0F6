CS62 is supposed to be challenging but Professor Papoutsaki made it easy by explaining everything very clearly during lectures.I highly recommend this class. This class is probably the only reason I successfully landed an internship in big tech this summer.
Yes! I'm one of the CS062 students to be helped in her office hour! This is the most enjoyable class this semester for me. CS062 is supposed to be challenging, (well it is) but Prof. Papoutsaki gives nice lectures and never minds helping you after class! Definitely take her class.
Really great professor! Though I only took the 190 seminar class, I can see from her other students that she really cares about her students. Workload is fair and she is willing to listen to students' suggestions on class. Always seeing her in cs labs trying to help students with CS62. She's also really intelligent and accessible.
