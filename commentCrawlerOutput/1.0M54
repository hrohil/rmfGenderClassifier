He is nitpicky and doesn't care about students. He can never wait to end classes early. Butchered students' names for an entire semester and didn't bother to ask them how to pronounce it. Flat out refuses to give points back when disputing grades even when the student is right. Refuses to bump a letter grade up when you're literally 0.1 away.
Literally the worst professor and class I've ever had. Lectures and notes are messy and confusing, and he can't explain the simplest of concepts. You learn nothing since the materials are actually middle school level easy (he taught us how to take standard deviations for 2 weeks). Did I mention he also gives zero care about students' well-beings?
