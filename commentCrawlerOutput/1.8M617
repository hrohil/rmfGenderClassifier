He is not a good teacher.
This teacher is utterly worthless. He uses wikipedia for his lectures. Test are ridiculous he takes off full credit for missing a brace in code. Always goes off tangent in his lectures and hard to understand. If he taught in spanish i would probably be doing better in the class.
Sometimes difficult to understand, however with the substantial curve he provided in my class (which he claimed was his usual curve), if one passed, they received an A in the course. So, I would recommend the professor simply due to the easy A. Also. as a side note, he is also a very respectable prof., which helps a ton.
unclear, bad hispanic accent, you leave the class knowing nothing
