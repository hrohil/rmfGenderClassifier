Great professor who is passionate and interesting. Focuses more on concepts and theory than coding. Interactive lectures and goes slowly to make sure everyone in the class understands. Great person inside and out of class - take her if you get the chance. Just make sure to go to office hours and do the work!
You will realize clearly that a specialty in a field has nothing to do with teaching abilities. She uses exams made by a professor in a different class so doesn't know whats on the exam until the day of the exam. She also doesn't provide as much materials as other professors in the same section. Just take other prof's class. Its easier and better.
She focuses on more on concepts rather than actually coding. She goes over the material so everyone can understand. You might think that she is going too slow, but in the end, you will understand why; Concepts are more important than actual coding. If you did not take CS170, I recommend to take her class. MUST GO TO OFFICE HOUSE FOR HW!
Dr. Will is a great professor. Although Java is not her native language, she is passionate about teaching and her lectures are straight forward. She goes through the lectures really really fast, so make sure you go to her office hours as often as possible. If she knows you well, she will probably try to regrade your exams to boost your grade.
Prof. Wildani was an interesting lecturer, although she went very very quickly indeed. Tests were hard but fair, as was the homework.
