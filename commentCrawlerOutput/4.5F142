Do your homework, come to class and lab, and always read the book before class. make her happy. she is sometimes impatient if you do not understand, but for the most part she is nice
She is a bit difficult at first and you think you will be failing until you get your midterm grade. Somehow had a B for my midterm grade and ever since then have been getting B+ and As on all the assignments. Very clear and makes you learn it but will help if you are struggling.

Truly one of the hardest professors that you will ever have, but if you are intending to go to grad school succeeding in her classes will definitely prepare you for what is ahead.
