Great semester. It really helped that he had practice tests that prepared you for the real thing. Don't slack and take advantage of this golden opportunity.
START LABS EARLY.  He throws you off because he seems like an easy-going guy.  Ask for help early.  He is fair and willing to help.
Lectures are way more easier to follow that the book.  The projects are tough so you have to ask for help and start early.
Tough class, but the lectures were clear and easy to follow.  He's funny in a dorkish/cool kind of way and very helpful on projects.  I'm so glad he corrected all the typos in the textbook.
