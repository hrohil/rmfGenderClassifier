As soon as he found out I wasn't majoring in computer science, he went from mediocre helpfulness during both class questions and office hours to no helpfulness at all. If you're a major and don't mind muddling through circular explanations, he might be a good professor for you, but if you're not a major, don't expect his respect.
Not particularly good at explaining difficult concepts - always tried to help out as long as he thought I wanted to major in computer science, but didn't grasp what I was having issues with, and paid little attention to my difficulties in the course after I told him that I wasn't going to major in CS.
Lectures were very straightforward, engaging and clearly explained. Made algorithms and concepts super interesting and easily understandable in class. Extremely accessible outside class!!! However problem sets were killer hard and only vague hints were given when asked for help due to the homework's nature. Tests were fair and straightforward.
