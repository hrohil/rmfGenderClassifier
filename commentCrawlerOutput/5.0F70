Sohie saved my life while taking CS111! She was so clear and taught me in 10 mins what took two lectures to cover. One of my favourite prpfessors at Wellesley
Sohie has been my lab instructor for both CS111 and CS230.  She is SUPER SWEET, will answer any questions of yours, and is so understanding!!! One of the easiest people to approach.  Everyone loves her and I would bet my life that 1110 people would recommend.  She explains concepts very clearly, concisely, and methodically.
Super helpful and sweet! And her office is a safe space too! I LOVE SOHIE!
