I absolutely love Dr. Havill. He is a literal angel and so kind. He has office hours but doesn't care if you just drop by whenever's good for you because that's how awesome he is. Also if you have any questions he is so helpful and sweet and doesn't make you seem like a moron. Overall a great professor and guy. No surprise he has a 5.0 rating
His lectures are super clear. You can get good grade if you pay attention to his lectures. Projects are not hard and work in pairs. I like him.
One of the best professors in the math/cs dept. Really friendly and helpful
Nice
Quite simply my favorite professor of all time.  Very knowledgeable yet capable of explaining problems and solutions in an easy to understand manner.  Never holds your hand for you but gives you the right push in the direction towards success.
BEST CLASS EVER
Such a great guy. Very approachable and encouraging. Made me really consider CS minor. Challenging. Funny; Shy in an endearing way. Wish I could take him again.
Excellent prof.  Super helpful, and teaches you a lot.
