Floryan is an exceptional lecturer who does the course material justice. CS 2150 covers a lot of ground, even though the course is relatively easy. Floryan can explain concepts well to newcomers and is pretty entertaining.
CS 2150 is the hardest class I have ever taken, but Floryan is also a fantastic teacher. Hilarious and you can just tell he's legit.
Tough class, but an amazing professor. He's funny, engaging, down to earth, and really knows the material. It's a lot of work, but Floryan is a great teacher.
2150 was one of the hardest classes I've taken, and though Floryan tends to be a tough grader, he is a fantastic lecturer who really cares about the students learning and doing well.
I would not have taken this class if it wasn't with Floryan. Great professor. That being said, his classes are super difficult. Be prepared to work forever on Algo homework and still not feel prepared for the exams. It's a tough class, he makes it tough, but he's such a great lecturer and you do really learn in classes he teaches.
Floryan is awesome!! I've taken Algorithms and HCI and I have enjoyed both of them. He really wants to teach the students and is really understanding of what the students need! For HCI, he even extended the deadline of a homework assignment and push backed a test to make it easier on us.
Floryan is a good lecturer and the material is interesting but... The assignments' instructions are unclear, and the one programming homework given was absurd and more about nonsensical implementations in Java than it is about HCI. Grading is often very subjective and harsh. You'll get random points deducted for formatting. Poorly organized class.
Floryan was the best professor I've had at UVA.  He is the most clear and organized teacher I've had, and he's really good at helping students get through tough patches in the semester.
Floryan is the man. Take all of his classes. Explains the material well, gives interesting lectures, and is very approachable and understanding. Makes a fun class even more fun.
