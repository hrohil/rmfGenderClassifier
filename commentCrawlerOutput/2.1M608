Seems to understand code But Cant relate it well at all with other student
Disorganized af. This guy asked to meet up with me when I transferred in a couple weeks into the semester, so we agreed on a time and place. He was an hour late. His excuse? He was "talking to a student in the tutoring center." I had passed there on my way to his office and no one was there. His lectures are very unfocused too. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
Bad professor, he thinks that everyone knows programming, if you have no experiences, be prepared to get low grades on your tests.
Incredibly smart and VERY helpful if you take initiative to go to his office hrs. with specific questions. Lecture is usually very informative but occasionally tangential. GO TO CLASS--he provides substantial hints to the assignments. Take notes/diagrams if possible. Tests based on the assignment/projects/lecture/questions people ask. Fair prof.
seems to understand the material but has a very hard time explaining it without running off into a tangent. If you have no programming experience; may God help your soul. Can be helpful in class or in person but is very hard to reach via email.
Not a bad teacher if you know what you are getting into before you walk in. If you have very little programming experience, it's basically an immersion class. He seems to have a lot of trouble explaining things simply. Be prepared to pay constant attention if you have little prior experience. (Note:i took CS1412 with him, not Data Structures)
Mr Wertz is helpful and knows what he's talking about. If you show up to class, you're good. Start projects ahead of time. Multiple times in the semester there was an assignment worked out in class for you to learn from. Very useful. Don't make the mistake of shrugging off the labs and not going even though the first few assignments are super easy.
