Very accessible and friendly prof. Class itself can be dry and it can be difficult to stay awake, but discussions became more frequent later on in the term, which made the class better. Assignments are fun but class time can feel like a reiteration of the reading and often feels pointless.
Best gesticulator on campus! I've never seen someone move their hands around so much during a lecture. More seriously though, he's a v. nice guy and a good prof.
Took class in F17, forgot to rate. I struggled in this course as it is not easy to pick up and understand immediately. The lectures were great at explaining tough concepts and proof techniques, but the homework and exams were hard. Expect a curve in the exams, and good feedback on where you went wrong and how to improve.
Eric is a nice guy but his lectures can be dry. HW assignments tended to be interesting although challenging. Exams weren't all too difficult and I ended up doing successively better on them as the term progressed. Probably one of the easier intro profs but the nature of the material makes the course inherently difficult for some people.
Eric is a very good prof. He's clear, uses many examples, and is always willing to help out. I struggled a lot in my Intro CS class and was weary when I decided to take Data Structures with him, but I've learned so much and have felt super comfortable in his classroom. His exams are fair and his assignments aren't too bad. Great professor!
Like any CS prof he gives lots of HW and readings but they're doable and if you're confused Eric is a very nice guy and can help you out. The class is mostly lecture but again that's expected for an intro class. Not a very hard prof but really effective in conveying the course content.
Eric gives tough exams but they're curved nicely. Weekly HW takes a bit of time and often very difficult but is perfectly manageable with a little bit of logic and help from the many ways he and the department can assist you. Overall he's cool and a great prof!
I really love Eric! He's not a very difficult grader and he's super clear especially for those who have no coding background (aka me) so he made Python extremely approachable and fun to learn. Assignments and exams were interesting and not all too hard. Everyone in my class really likes Eric and I think you will too!
I like Eric a lot, he's a great guy, knows his stuff and gave solid lectures. He isn't the most creative or inspirational lecturer, but he's still young and improving quickly. Super super helpful outside of class, really nice and a fair grader.
