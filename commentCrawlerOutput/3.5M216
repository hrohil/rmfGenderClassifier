Really helpful professor. Listened to students always
He literally wrote the book on computer graphics
I took me 3 tries of doing poorly on his tests to figure out how best to study for his exams: you need to memorize alot!  4 try and I got it.  Projects are very demanding.
This professor obviously has total disdain for his students (all but PHds). He make disparaging remarks about some students that might not get the material instantly, is poorly prepared for lectures, and shows no interest in them. Many later assignments in the semester are mostly unsolvable and this from a student that did well in his classes.
