Andrew is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. His homework is just the right amount of problems. Exams are fairly hard in my opinion, but fair in the questions asked. I almost never had to learn things on my own. He is also personable, and makes the material feel relevant to you. He also gives very good lectures. Take his class!
Definitely my favorite class and my favorite professor at UNC. Occasionally misses office hours but is very useful when he has them. Lectures are engaging and he really cares whether you understand the material or not. Homeworks and Tests are challenging and fair but certainly doable because of how in-depth lectures are. Take his class!
Andrew is a wonderful professor! He really helps students through difficult material, and is very good about pausing for questions during lecture. Homework and tests are fair, and office hours are a great resource.
He is honestly one of the best professors I have ever had. The material can be difficult but he tries his best to make sure that everyone understands it. You can really tell that he cares about his students.
Andrew is probably one of the best/better graduate math teachers. His lectures are helpful, attendance isn't required but it helps a lot so I wouldn't skip, and he usually gives example problems when he can. Homework assignments relate to what we're learning well, and office hours are a good place to get help on them. Tests are also pretty fair
Andrew is way better than any other math instructor I have had at UNC; I went into 383 expecting to lose a bit of my soul from what other students had told me, but he makes it super understandable. If you stay engaged during lecture you'll come out fine on exams and homework! Definitely take any math class you need with him if you can!
Here's a review Andrew, you're a great professor :D
Prudhom is an AWESOME grad student!!!! He is an amazing teacher and gives great examples. His tests are fair and follow the layout of his homework. He's very understanding and helpful and uses class time to make sure that everyone understands the material.
