Jonathan is one of my favorite teachers at CC.
hes a good teacher.
Bredin knows his stuff. Period.  He's one of the sharpest profs I've ever met. He has a kind of "electric intelligence" that's amazing.  It can throw some off-guard.  If you can handle his fast-pace and want to learn a lot, take his classes.  It's a go/no-go with Bredin.  The level of commitment he demands means you have to be "into" the class.
Had him for Linear Algebra and Intro to Comp Sci--he will work you VERY hard, but he is a PHENOMONAL teacher, and very dedicated and devoted to students and his job.
great prof. easy to approach. very helpful.
The hardest class I've taken at CC, but by far the class I learned the most in.  Jonathan has high expectations for his students, but if you work hard, he'll respect you for it.
