Great professor! Challenging class but worth it!
taking cs101E with him now. Excellent prof! (I can't read his writing on the board, tho.)
This man's class was the hardest I've ever taken and for no reason.  You will dread going to class for fear he'll call on you just to mock you for not knowing the right answer.  His assignments are impossible and will consume all of your time (many all-nighters).  Best wishes to anyone who has to take one of his classes especially CS414.
Really challenging programming assignments. I recommend that you get a partner, if you want to survive them.
Class is what I expected, but Humphrey is, well, an ****. He'll call people out in class and make fun of you if you don't get the question right. If you don't know the answer for sure, don't raise your hand or claim ignorance. It's better to bear the "I don't know" embarrassment rather than have the man mock you.
Great teacher! Really knows the material! very challenging, though. Best class I've taken at UVa.

Good teacher, interesting class.  Tough assignments but with work you can get through them and learn something.
