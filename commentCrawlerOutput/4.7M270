Professor Newport is an all around good guy. The course isn't easy, but his lectures are VERY informative. He is clear about his expectations on graded work. He has no ridiculous expectations outta you, go to class, pay attention and you'll do fine. What more can you want out of a professor?
Probably one of the best, if not the best, professors I've ever had. Clear, fair, concise, and helpful. Also not condescending at all, which seems to be a problem with a lot of CS professors. I would highly recommend taking his class for Algorithms. Only thing is that the material is tough - be sure to show up and take diligent notes.
Great professor, really good at explaining complex topics, so glad I took him for math methods. Tests were challenging but totally doable. Little awkward but definitely a nice guy.
Newport is no doubt an accomplished scholar and is very comfortable with the material he teaches. His use of the blackboard to actually write down definitions, important notes, and draw out diagrams is a welcome breath of fresh air at a time when most professors would rather click through a PowerPoint. Good luck reading his faint writing though!
One of the best professors I've ever had at Georgetown. He is an excellent and systematic explainer, and his grading is clear and fair (also he's published five excellent books about productivity and self-improvement that were life-changing to read). So glad I got him again for Intro to Algorithms.
This class hardly (if at all) used the textbook. If you went to class you saw everything that he wanted to know. One midterm and one final and a problem set due each week made the workload very manageable. The grading is a bit nitpicky so make sure to know the format he likes for problems from class. Overall a nice guy and very clear in lecture.
