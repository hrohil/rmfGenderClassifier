Hawaiian shirts aside, Edwards isn't that great at teaching a big lecture hall. When I go to office hours he is very informative, but I wouldn't recommend him if you want to pass the class without the use of office hours. DO THE PROGRAMS EARLY! He is sassy too.
The class is very informative and Edwards is incredibly knowledgeable, but the information is presented poorly. This course caused me to feel like my questions do not deserve answers and it is my fault for not being a master programmer right away. His tone is often condescending when speaking and does not seem to care about his students' confusion.
Stephen Edwards is the most condescending professor I have ever had. He teaches only to the students who know how to program, despite the fact that it is an INTRO CLASS, and just like the kids who do know how to program, he teaches the new programmers as if they're stupid. His lectures are always behind what we're doing in labs or programs.
Professor Edwards is a really good professor.  He made Web-Cat, a widely used automatic grading tool.  A lot of students hate Web-Cat, but I like that it gives you automatic feedback, you pretty much know what to expect, and you have unlimited submissions (meaning 100% on all projects if you start early!).  Always start on projects early!!
A very intelligent man who teaches and administrates the course very poorly. As much as he knows about the subject, his approach to the course was far more than disappointing.
this class is not fun at all!!! on top of that Steven Edward, this teacher should not teach he should be doing a research or something else he doesn't have the ability to teach what so ever and he helps out only people he likes  .trust me i have seen it!!! my addvise to you is dont take any class with him!!!
This guy cannot teach, and shouldn't be allowed to teach, if thats what you want to call his pitiful attempt  on mondays wednesdays and fridays. Horribile, never learned a thing, just worried about getting his projects done on time and he couldn't even figure out a lot of his own programs.  SAD
The course was poorly run and the grading system that prof. edwards created provided bad or no feedback.
