She expects you to read her mind and know exactly what she wants from you in every paper and presentation. Would never take again. One of my least favorite people and professors. Seems really sweet but can be a you know what.
She is a fantastic teacher! If you need help with anything, she's happy to help. Dr. Reese is great!
She seems like a great lady, but in the pre engineering class I facebooked the whole time... Her homework can be done ten minutes before class... She just did not keep my attention the whole time...
Best CS professor at MSU and knows how to explain difficult concepts in plain English.  Gotta love Dr. Reese...highly recommended.
She is awesome!
