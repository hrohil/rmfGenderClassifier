He is literally my favorite professor in the entire department. His lecture is always so well organized that everything flows. You could tell he really enjoys teaching and cares about students. He is incredibly smart, helpful, and SUPER chill. His office is always full with students. I already decided whichever class he teaches I'll go take it.
Professor Bhakta is a real gem.
Super smart man. Funnest class I've taken so far. You must think.
He is one of the best! His lecture is so engaging and obviously he knows what he is teaching. The homework problems are pretty hard and often you need to go to his office hour to get everything done. His office hour is always pretty crowded. His tests are really hard but the whole course is fair if you actually get this stuff.
Dr. Bhakta is brilliant!! So brilliant that maybe he should stay with the brilliant students. If you have no prior knowledge on computer science, this class is hell!!! If you do, it may be easy A. Also, he never returned back any lab assignments or hw, so I had no clue what grade I was going o get!
One of my favorite professors! His lectures are engaging and easy to understand. The course was challenging, but he's helpful and always available to students.  Dr. Bhakta is outrageously smart, knows his materials very well, (plus brilliant at board games), but he's far from condescending/intimidating. Very chill and can connect well to students.
Take him if you can. He has office hours almost everyday, and they're very helpful. Also, everything feels fair. All the resources necessary to get good grades are available to you. Labs and assignments are really easy to get 100 on, but tests are pretty hard. He also grades on a curve, but he never curves down. It will only help your grade.
