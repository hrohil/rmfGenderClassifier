The course design is faulty. Too many assumptions about the level of computer knowledge by the instructor.  There was a quiz every week (graded) and each week she added more and more pages to the base  assignment.  Strictly coding.  Must have some knowledge of Photoshop, Dreamweaver and javascript or else you will be clueless.
