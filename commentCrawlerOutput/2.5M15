Horrible teacher, Can't explain. TAs are just for "moral support", and it makes this class harder.
He is a good Professor. He knows the material and he cares to teach them right.  The material itself is not easy though.
Belittles students' questions during class.
Horrible instructor, avoid like the plague.
One of the best theory classes I have ever had (and I had quite a few). Though material is not trevial, he managed to retain my attention throughout entire class. I took the follow-up class as well. Very, very good!
Plotkin can't explain anything.  He should resign from teaching.
An ok teacher, doesn't really sympathize with students.
