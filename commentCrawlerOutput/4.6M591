Him: Translates concepts into perfect English. Soft spoken but excellent delivery. Easy to get in touch with outside class. Willing to adjust grades (if you provide solid reasoning). Class: I've had 3 classes that cover these topics; his was by far the easiest (because he can actually teach). I would recommend taking this class BEFORE calc 3.
Solid professor!  Had him for database management systems and will have him for DCSP as well.  We had a quiz every Friday, but if you studied for it you'd be fine.  Word of caution: we had a group project (though you could do it by yourself if you chose) that we got blasted on part 1 of because we didn't know he posted a grading rubric for it.
Crumpton is the man! He knows his stuff, and is a fair grader. The TA's, not so much.
Crumpton is awesome. You have to go to class since the material and the book are hard, but this guy knows his stuff.
Very nice and knowledgeable, good teacher. Preferred for CSE 1284
