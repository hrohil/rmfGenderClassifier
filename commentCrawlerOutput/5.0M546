Prof. Rosiglioni was an amazing professor.  He handled intro programming like a pro and was easy to understand his lectures. He wants class participation and asks questions, which is great!  Pay attention in class and you should be okay.
Interesting class. Enterprise Architecture Software. He knows his stuff. Gives good feedback.  Likes to make sure everyone understands the material. Takes a little too long to grade assignments, but makes up for that by allowing you to go back and make adjustments where needed. Breaks are weird, like 7 minutes. Why not 5min or just 10 min.
Answers questions and takes his time to explain.
