amazing class
He is very good prof. Fair to everyone! And I love his assignments(projects) and exams :) Great going Luis! And yea, amazing sense of humor!!!!
He is the best professor I ever had!!
One of the best professors I ever had.  He was engaged, prepared and seemed to care about teaching.  He was quick to respond to emails and provide feedback.  He also has a great sense of humor which made sitting through some dull material a little better.
One of the best professors I've ever had. Both as an undergrad and a graduate.  There are not many professors as good and helpful as Professor Gravano in any university I've attended.
Cutie!!!  Interesting projects, but a bit too much sometimes.
Excellent professor! Very clear in lectures and found problem sets doable yet challanging.
