Did a good job and was very helpful.
He is very boring in lecure. You can barely hear him and he makes the topic very dry. It was hard staying awake in his class.
There is a lot of work. The lectures can be boring but you must attend them to understand your assignments. Professor Bull is, however, adorable and clearly brilliant. He's helpful outside of class.
Bull is an awesome lecturer and is clearly brilliant - his lectures are very organized and tie together quite well.  As a result of his brilliance, however, the exams are a serious stretch and the assignments can be quite time consuming.  I learned a ton and really enjoyed the class, but be prepared to WORK if you take his class!
Bull's an awesome guy.  Very smart, very nice.  Assignments are quite time-consuming.  Or maybe they just felt like that because I put them off to the last minute...  Whatever, the class is kind of hard, but doable (and required for majors...)
His subject material is mind-boggling. It takes a lot of thinking, but he helps. He's a somewhat interesting lecturer, and you won't get the homework done without the lectures. Assignments are about 10 hours for a weekly assignment. Expect to stay up late in the computer lab wracking your brain. A little scatterbrained but helpful outside class.
