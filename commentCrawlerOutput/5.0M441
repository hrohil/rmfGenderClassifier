While the class itself was hard, Professor Helmuth did a great job at making the material understandable, and was always open to meeting to help with labs. He was a good lecturer and did a good mix of lecture and class interaction for the course. Straightforward in expectations, and understanding and helpful. Would 100% recommend.
I was in the first class that Helmuth taught and he was amazing!  He was such a great lecturer and was a quirky fun person to listen to.  He was helpful in lab and his expectations were clear and instructions easy to follow.
