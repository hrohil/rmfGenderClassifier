Easily one of the least inspiring and disorganized professors I have had at Vanderbilt. Despite the easiness of the class, I was thoroughly disappointed at how little I learned about the field of Scientific Computing. Grading was horribly untimely despite giving us dates when he would finish grading.
Dr. Bodenheimer ended up being the worst professor I had at Vanderbilt. The skills and materials required to be successful on the projects (which are the only grades in the class) are not sufficiently supplied by the lectures, leaving students in the dark. He is a prime example why Vanderbilt's CS department is not up to the caliber it should be.
(Fall 2010) I had Bobby B for the CS module of ES140 - without a doubt the most boring class I've taken. Reading the textbook was required, but the lectures were pulled straight from the book - making attendance pointless. Used software called Alice - one of the most non-user-friendly programs out there. TONS of extra credit though. Easy A.
His graphics class is hard, but it is great.  He is very smart and up to date in the field. The best teacher I've had here.
Bodenheimer is the worst teacher ever.  His class consists of him reading directly off of Powerpoint slides then showing us Disney movies.  He does not teach us anything about how to do the final project, which is worth your whole grade.  Pretty useless in general.
Might as well not go to class because he's not very helpful there.  Same applies for office hours.  He's fairly condescending in most conversations.  Needs to get down off his high horse.
Dr. Bodenheimer, though knowledgable in his field, is quite possibly one of the worst undergrad professors i've ever had.  His smug indifference for his students' understanding of the subject makes even visiting his office hours a loathesome chore.
Bobby B is the absolute worst professor that I've ever had.  His lectures were extemely unhelpful, assignments unreasonable, and worthwhile help outside of class was nonexistant. I've sworn never to give money to Vanderbilt until Bobby B is history.
