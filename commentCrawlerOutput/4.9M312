very helpful, very clear, and very fair - and quite funny as well. I thought I wouldn't like CS, but I rather enjoyed it!
He was very clear and very organized. He was also very funny and he likes Matrix, Buffy, and Harry Potter, which is always a huge plus.
Nice guy. Really terrific and helpful. He even offers late night hours at the science center to help with homework. One night he stayed until after 2 AM to help everyone understand an assignment. Seriously committed. Take his class, you won't regret it!
I love this professor! He is very very kind and helpful! He prepares well for classes and is a great lecturer. I find his examples particularly helpful.
