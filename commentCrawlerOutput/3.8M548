Marko Puljic is the man! While the material is upper level software engineering, which can be dense, Puljic is very a forgiving grader and flexible. The grade comes from a midterm and final project. In both cases you can basically create whatever you want as long as he approves it. If it runs, you will get a good grade. A++ for this C++ professor.
No textbook/any lecture notes.Basically have to learn on your own using the websites he posts, which makes taking this class kinda waste of money.Incoherent lecturing and hard to follow the point he's trying to make+bad sense of humor.Finishes C++ syntax in 2months.Willing to help students on 1-1 basis but why not just make the lecture better?
