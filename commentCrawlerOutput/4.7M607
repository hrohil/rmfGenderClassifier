Great guy, even a greater instructor. Cares a lot about the students and am not surprised to see that his rating is high. Definitely recommended.
He doesn't elaborate a whole lot with questions but I though his lectures and slides were very straightforward. You do not need the text, he doesn't even refer to it. It is purely lecture based. The way he takes attendance is unannounced quizzes which aren't graded, you go over them in class. Great teacher for ComSci
Professor Pu was an excellent teacher. He really seemed to care about students understanding the material, and the class ended up being a great learning experience. Course expectations were clear, but he allowed students a little bit of grace. Would definitely take again.
Very helpful. Explains the material, doesn't just read from a power point.
Mr. Cong is an outstanding instructor with a strong grasp of the material he teaches.  This is a tough class and the material is by no means easy, but he will go to great lengths to make sure you fully comprehend the information he puts out. I would take another class taught by him anytime.
Amazing teacher, easy to understand. He will answer any question you ask and if he doesn't know the answer he will look it up and explain it in the next lecture. He is a graduate student and already a better professor than others. He helped me with scholarshipjob applications and was very helpful. Take if possible!
Very nice, makes sure you understand everything that he's going over. Always open for questions, fair grader. Takes attendance.
