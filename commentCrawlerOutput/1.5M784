Good guy
He might as well be talkin Latin.. This is one of the worst professors i've had, "you know what i'm sayin" he explains like you have a Phd already.. also very hard to follow, doesn't use the book much .. however he is easy...
El-Diablo! Nasty, nasty man.  Knowledgable but he HATES students and teaching.  You can learn things from him in his database class, but he is not very helpful and his lectures are awful.
