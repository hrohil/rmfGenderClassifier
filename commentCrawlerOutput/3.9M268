Don't take this class if you are a CS major, since you won't learn anything and might actually get dumber. The class isn't hard (just three short assignments all semester) but basically involves Devost and random guest lectures bloviating. Grading criteria is unclear, but easy class if all you want is a B+.
Class was awesome and very much reality-based.
SUPER EASY. Got an A in the class. Pointers: Don't buy books, just go to class, and partner up with someone to write a sexy bomb-ass final paper. The more creative you are, the more likely you'll score brownie points. Also, kids get jobs from this class; perfect for seniors and grad students who are panicking about job searches.
Undergrads should take this course - its an easy intro to the cyber world and looks good being a "graduate" level course.  Readings are not really mandatory, neither is class participation.  Mostly guest lectures.  You really only need to work hard on your term paper -other than that its a breeze.

Information Warfare was a blast.  "Hacker storytime"... he brings in his just-as knowledgeable and authoritative and interesting friends to lecture.  Amazingly interesting and provocative class.  No final, papers are easy and interesting.  GREAT CLASS... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Class was very well-taught.  Experience in private sector was a definite plus.  Lots of readings, but you only have to do 3 of the short assignments.  Make sure not to miss class.  Highly reccomend taking the class.
