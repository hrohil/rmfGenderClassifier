Dan's the man. Don't leave without taking a class from him.
Dan is great! Super chill professor. Coding assignments were really interesting. Made me feel very confident in my choice to study comp sci at wes.
a great lecturer and a great person. I love him!!!!
Amazing professor. If you want to ensure a great experience be sure to take Licata. He teaches extremely well: It is very structured and useful. He cares about you.   If you take his class, be prepared to work hard. But the rewards are endless.   I loved it.
He's a very nice and funny guy. His lectures are quite long, but very clear. He will help you with any problems you have and clarify any questions. He once reached out to me to check up on my performance after screwing up an assignment, which really helped and motivated me. He sends out use grade progress reports every now and then. Great prof!
211 with Licata is rigorous but rewarding. It's basically a watered-down version of a very similar course he taught at CMU's SCS. Very helpful in lecture and lab. Having some background in programming isn't *necessary*, but definitely useful.
