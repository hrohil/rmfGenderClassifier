Took this course during summer school, and he did the reverse classroom setting. I enjoyed this approach for summer school and I think Dr. Thomas has a great mind set for summer school. He teaches you a lot without making you overwhelmed, and understands you want to do well so he helps his student be successful.
Best teacher I have ever had.
Avoid at all costs.  Anything else would be libelous.
Very thorough and easily understood.  You'll learn much!
