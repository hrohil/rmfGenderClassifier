Professor Balch is amazing! He's funny and very renowned in the quantitive finance industry. His videos on Udacity are extremely useful, and altogether the class was very doable.
This professor will forever be part of my top 3 lecturers at Tech. He made the course content very interesting and easy to understand (mainly thanks to his Udacity course). Almost all the questions in the tests are from the practice tests (a bit too many in my opinion). Homework is fairly challenging so start early and go to office hours!
Course is manageable but some of the assignments are quite challenging, seek help sooner. ML4T ended up being a weed out class for grad students (I thought we were all beyond such classes but I guess not). The professor seems nice overall, quite humorous during lectures. I am however not a fan of required Piazza, lots of useless posts.
Taking his class on machine learning for trading right now. He is no doubt one of my favorite professors ever and I've been at Georgia Tech for 5 years. Going to his lectures aren't necessary but he does drop a hint at test questions every now and then. Also, be prepared to watch a lot of videos from his Udacity course on ML4T.
He's funny. Knows his stuff
I am just taking his CS 6446 ML4T class. He is a great professor. He is not condescending at all. He is very humble, which I think is a great attribute. So you do not feel intimidated. I wish he offered more classes!
I am the instructor.  Thought I would start by giving myself a good review :-)
