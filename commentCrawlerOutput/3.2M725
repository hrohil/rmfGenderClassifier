I really enjoyed Programming 1 with Dr. Gray. I had never programed before but the course set up made it easy to learn and I like his approach to teaching.
I don't understand why Dr. Gray gets a bad rep. I think he's funny (I'm aware that that bit is mostly just me, others think he just has a weird sense of humor), clear, and very helpful. Go to his office hours if there's anything you don't understand. I didn't get that til the end. I didn't turn in 2 of the projects  and still got a B+ in the class.
Dr. Gray is great.  He's very approachable during office hours and will spend as much time as you need going over things one on one. He grades in a way that emphasizes improvement rather than letting your grade tank with one bad project which is especially nice when you're first learning. If you wanna know your grade, just ask.
Prof. Gray knows how to program, but fails in teaching the class in an exciting way. The biggest drawback is when he fails to go over the project after you turned it in. Also, he never gives the answers to the practice test and didn't go over the test in class much .  I would recommend taking java online course. Try Coursea or edx websites.
Very unclear; gives no feedback or returns no assignments/projects/tests. Highly recommend taking courses with other professors.
Although he sometimes would get his languages confused, he was very knowledgeable on the topic and was an extremely nice guy (although a bit eccentric). Overall it was an easy class with some exciting labs.
He seemed not very knowledgeable about Java. We turned in labs every week and homework, but I only got one or two back the entire semester. I knew more and could have taught the class better than him. I would not recommend taking classes with him. Take Dr. VanDrunen for CSCI 235. He knows and teaches the material much better than Dr. Gray.
