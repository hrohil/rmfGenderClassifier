240 was hard not gonna lie but ben really knows his stuff. Is he the clearest/most engaging in class though? No. Maybe it's because I didn't enjoy the content to begin with but I found it really difficult to focus in class and when I did it was confusing. He's alright in office hours though but won't help you as much as Jean will. 240 is rough
