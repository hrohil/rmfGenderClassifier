Her answer to pretty much all questions on assignments was, "google it." Really boring lectures and seemed to assign a lot of the work for the sake of assigning work. Basically just relies on an online course and provides zero helpful guidance.
Generally a very nice person, terrible teacher. Expects you to do everything on your own. Gave us a final exam on topics that were never once mentioned in class but were just from a textbook for the class. Generally extremely vague/boring lectures.
She skips a lot of details, probably because I know far less than she assumes I do. However, I learn a lot from her and she is really nice and helpful.
Generally nice person, but absolutely horrible professor - one of the worst I've had. Don't take any of her classes if you can avoid it. She zooms through the material and expects everyone to follow along with complete understanding. Lectures are dull and long, might as well not attend. Not supportive of people pursuing CS and having difficulty
Horrible professor, by far the worst I have ever had. But there are incredible course assistants (TAs). They're essential for doing well in the class and they're very available.
A very basic class. Lectures can begin to feel repetitive and boring after a few classes. Activities and homework are how you learn the most. It's extremely easy to get help with all the TAs and plenty of office hours. Homework projects can get pretty long, especially without previous experience in programming, but help is easy to find.
