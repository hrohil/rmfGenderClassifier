I learned a lot from Prof. Subramanian. She is a great teacher and professor.
Devika is one of the friendliest teachers I have come across at Rice. She is quite good at explaining difficult concepts, and is very patient when speaking to students outside of class. Don't even hesitate to take a class with her.
My experience, about 4 years ago, was that her classes were poorly organized. She jumped from one complex topic to another, without a lot of intuition to help students along. She's very energetic, and has a lot of passion for her subject. But, assignments didn't come back graded in time and there wasn't much appreciation for the subject conveyed.
