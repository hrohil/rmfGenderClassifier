She is probably the worst professor at Vanderbilt. I cannot think of a single thing on which to compliment her. Do yourself a favor and take the class when Doug Schmidt teaches it.
Great professor. Clear explanations and interesting lectures.
class was the single most disorganized thing I've ever had to deal with.
Worst professor ever
She gives way too much work.  Projects will take over your life.  Her assignments and tests are sometimes confusing and badly worded.  Harsh grading.  Be sure to take 270 or some other course in Lisp before you take this class since she does a poor job in Lisp introduction.
Easily the most work I've ever had to put into a class.  If you are not strong at LISP, do not take.  Taking time to write this review is the first break I've had from AI this semester.
Great course, the project is what's a lot of work--besides that its not too bad. I think we had 6 homeworks (best 5 counted) and a take-home midterm
Much more clear than Biswas and easier than Fischer.  Is willing to spend extra time to make sure you know the material if you ask for it.  Will joke around with you in class.  Recommended.
