Awful in general! Your teaching yourself!
His class is pretty useless, and his lectures are dry and boring. All you do is read boring papers that you learn almost nothing from. I did learn a little bit from the projects, though. I think his grading is predeterminedno matter what you do or don't do, it seems he's already decided what he's going to give you. Avoid if possible.
This professor is unclear and not helpful. He is unaware of what he is discussing in class and forgets what he tells students. He is not consistent with his grading, and changes his standards of grading each week without telling students. He does not understand the meaning of communication. Good Luck, avoid a class with this professor if you can.
Unstructured course, extremely confusing lectures, poor quality of assignments. Utter  waste of an elective.
This professor has vague expectations.  He does not grade anything in his courses, yet claims that each assignment is crucial.  He does not teach anything, and he often invites guest faculty to lecture.  Final grades are arbitrary based on how much he likes you.  If you're an InfoSec major, good luck because this professor's courses are mandatory.
Best professor I have ever met in my life. Extremely down to earth and very knowledgeable. Highly experienced and I am gratified to be one of his students.

I thought Prof Ahamad was very good and inspiring. He is very sharp and abreast with the research in his field. His projects focus on creativity and can be a bit openended.
Hard course, great teacher
