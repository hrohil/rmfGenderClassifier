Super patient and helpful. I was failing his Theory of Computation class, and he told me to drop out unless I came to his office hours every week for help. I did and each week he walked me through the assignments as well as retaught me concepts for his exams. I ended up with an A- for the semester. He was incredibly patient and kind to me.
Don't take any of his classes. He is unclear, not organized, and doesn't care about his students. This was his first year teaching this class, and he made no effort to prepare any lectures or review the assignments that he was assigning. If you go to his office hours, he doesn't even attempt to help you.
Professor Levy is a great teacher. The only bad thing is that he digresses too much sometimes.
nice and helpful but boring to the point that comprehension is lost
Easier than I thought it would be, Levy's a pretty awesome guy.  Don't ****him off, he knows karate.
Great teacher, made CompSci interesting to a Politics/History double major.  A lot of people in my section got around a B or A, but that's because he works hard to get everyone on track.

Drink lots of coffee before class, his voice can put you to sleep. Material is somewhat difficult, but he grades leniently and much of the final grade is based on labs. He likes when you come to office hours.
Good prof, though work can be hard and explanations not always clear... but he is good.
