Fatme is one of the best professors I have ever come across. She challenges her students to always think for themselves. She makes sure that her students are on the same page as her, which establishes a base of understanding. She is also a fearless learner, goes the extra mile to answer the tougher questions. I enjoyed her classes immensely.
Great instructor
Fatme is fantastic. She is organized, knowledgeable, approachable, and thorough. She is an authority on the subject matter. The homework was intense as well as lengthy, but for a purpose. I learned a great deal from her course.
Ok, you need to study to get a good grade. Don't take her class if you expect to get an A without studying. If you want to want to learn the material go for it. She is always available during office hours + after class to answer questions. Half her tests  are give-aways and the other half, you're expected to really understand the material to pass.
Makes the class harder than it needs to be. Would teach a concept then move to advanced topics. Would not recommend.
Hard to understand. You really have to want to understand the material to succeed and then some.
