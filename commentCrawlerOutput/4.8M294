he teaches. he inspires. excellent class!
Interesting, clear lectures. Very nice. Definitely knows what he's teaching. Great class.
It's not the easiest class out there but he's an awesome professor.  He really cares about his students.  I think he curves to a B+. :)
Runs class at a challenging but do-able level. A very interesting teacher who is concerned that everyone learn the material and succeed.
Went to almost every lecture...  The lectures were complex, yet followable.  He engages the class, and it very excited about teaching.  Great guy and fair in his exams.  Interested in students learning the material.
