Dr. Nowick is one of the best lecturers I have ever had. He is incredibly good at conveying his material in a manner that is both enjoyable and easy to follow. If you take a class from him be prepared to work extremely hard... And yes he assigns lots of homework and projects, but you really will learn a lot!
He makes you do things that consumes a lot of time but has no meaning in the projects. The TAs are tough graders and make you feel that your hard work does not worth it. Nothing much learned but a lot of work. The lecture and HWs/Projects are poorly designed really.
