Rikk was hard. He's one of the finest CS professors at State but he really makes you work for the grade. Although the Programming Assignments were pretty rough, Rikk tried everything he could to boost the grade.   PRO TIP: Make sure you have a good rapport with the TA. It really helps. Also, try not to screw your 1st assignment.
Amazing teacher.  He's very clear and gives good examples.  His assignments and tests are TOUGH, but he usually gives you two weeks on each programming assignment.  Take his advice and start on them immediately.  He has good office hours, and he'll help you if you get stuck.  Make sure you nail those programs. They're a big chunk of your grade.
Rikk is a great teacher. He will make you work for that A though! Beware of the programming assignments, they can make or break your grade. Make sure to start early on them. If you ask for help last minute, he will give you a metaphorical middle finger through email.
Mr. Anderson is a great teacher. He means business and takes the material very seriously. He upholds high standards for the CSE department and will not pass you if he doesn't believe that you are prepared for the next course. He is extremely sensitive to cheating and plagiarism. He will come off as intimidating; do not be intimidated by him.
Tough but fair. If you have trouble with something, he is very helpful during his office hours. Be very specific on his test answers. He can be a tough grader at times, but if you understand the material, you'll pass.
While lectures can be boring sometimes, he explains things extensively and gives lots of examples. He clearly is very knowledgeable about the material and enjoys what he does.  He is very available outside and after class to answer any questions you would have. Tests are fair and he usually tells you what is going to be on it, especially if you ask
Pros: - On time to class  - Will give pointers - Shows example code (Please note that he has errors in his code.) Cons: - Extremely slow grader  - Counts off for the littlest things - Expects you to know CC++
Dr. Anderson was great! He was very clear about how to do things and knew what he was talking about for the most part. He's not big on homework but the ones he does give are hard but do make you think. He loves quizzes but always makes sure you know what to study for. He is very good about teaching concepts with will help in later classes.
