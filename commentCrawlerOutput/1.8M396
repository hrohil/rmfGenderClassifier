Without question, the worst instructor I have ever had at Vanderbilt. Everything in the class, from quiz dates to material to office hours to grading criteria is subject to change at a moment's notice. Quizzes were extremely difficult and you had to seek them out to get them back; the assignments were not graded until the last few weeks. Huge curve
Otte definetely fits more to the role of a great teaching assistance, he just cannot take the responsibility as a professor. However, you got the trade-off: he is a way-easier grader than doug schmidts and gives out final letter grade very generously, which could save your  GPA.
If you take CS 251 with Otte, you will learn nothing, or little.
Otte is the most irresponsible professor I've ever seen in Vanderbilt. The other day he let us go 15 minutes early because he was not prepared for the next ppt.
Take otte's class if you are suicidal and want to have more reason to end things.
All he cares about is his wife.  Otte is the worst professor I have ever seen in Vanderbilt, he decides whether or not to hold office hours in the weekend depending on his wife's travel plan. And his lecture was so boring that most of the students fall asleep. And he would not tell you anything about android and then let you do an app from scratch.
I learned a ton taking CS 251 from Otte but the class was one of the hardest things I've done in my life. Probably spent 20+ hours per week on his assignments for mediocre grades. That being said I really felt like I was a better programmer by the end of it all. Occasionally places too much emphasis on C++ features as oppose to design idioms
Knows his stuff.  Perhaps not the very best lecturer, he is very helpful in office hours.
