Really good lecturer and accessible outside of class for questions. Algorithms is tough but he makes it understandable and manageable. Only thing is he manages to sound a little bit condescending no matter what he's saying.
His lecture is a great way to accelerate study, but if you miss some, there is clear syllabus denoting which contents are demanded and which parts of textbook you should refer to as an alternative. Course content has considered students of different backgrounds: optional lectures or contents are offered for those in need of higher level study.
Fineman's likely the smartest professor in the entire department. Algorithms is lecture-based, and it's all on the whiteboard so you'll need to show up and take notes. The weekly HWs and the midterms stress problem solving, and there's almost no programming. Everything's done in pseudocode. The HW problems are few but difficult. Manageable class.
