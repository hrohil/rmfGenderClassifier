Professor Hoyle is a decent professor, and a nice guy, but his class wasn't anything special. Partially, this can be attributed to the wide curriculum. I was able to mostly understand when he explained, but sometimes it was a little confusing. I occasionally got the impression of an ego from him. I didn't always feel comfortable speaking.
I had a really hard time in the class (labs are really intense), partly because of my own life/health things. But Prof. Hoyle is very caring and understanding. He also uses comic strips to introduce topics, which I enjoy ;) Good lecturer w/ constructive activities, values student feedback, &amp; gives fun, open-ended final projects (no tests).
Had him for Systems and Data Structures. Roberto is still a new teacher and I think he's still improving.  His lectures can be pretty confusing and sometimes feel kind of irrelevant. Systems in general is a hot mess but I feel like Roberto didn't exactly help. Still, he's passionate, caring, and good in office hours.
Roberto is a true legend. He is somehow good at explaining things 1-on-1 but terrible at clarifying in class. Some people liked his lectures, most didn't, but he makes up for it in after-hours help/approachability. Also, he responds to emails/ class questions at 3am. To understand the material well u will have to study outside of lectures.
Professor Hoyle is a great guy, and is incredible at explaining CS concepts without using metaphors, which I love and appreciate. Data Structures is fairly easy, although that has a lot to do with which graders you get for the labs. He's also really nice, and always accessible. Unlimited resources, lots of learning. Highly recommend him.
