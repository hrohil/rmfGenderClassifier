Terrible professor who assigns everything last minute, with the worst TAs possible. The class is a joke. He responds to nothing on Piazza, and gives zero feedback. You might as well take parallel programming at your local community college.

a really nice guy.  very accessible outside of class and is always willing to help.  tho his attempts to help sometimes get more difficult than necessary.  assignments are long but very doable, and the exams are easy.  recommended for intermediate programming.
Very friendly teacher who makes alot of jokes, even tho no one laughs. Its sad, however hes a good guy and the assignments are long but not too bad. The tests are a demon tho.
