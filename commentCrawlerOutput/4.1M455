Dr. Abowd is probably the best professor I have had during my academic career, and possibly one of the best at Geogia Tech. He is a leader in his field, an incredible lecturer, and a sociable and caring guy. His classroom is creative and will be a unique experience that will benefit you in any career as you learn user centered thinking and design!
Abowd is the GOAT. His classes are fun and interactive. Every Friday we got food in the class! He is very knowledgeable and just a great human being. This man does it all. The class is pretty easy, though sometimes the grading criteria can be confusing. Be sure to have a good team in this class!
Curves class down but doesn't tell you about it. Class A con artist
Gregory tries to do nice things for his class, but his personality basically cancels that out He has a very intense way of communicating, and is overly critical/nitpicky at any slight imperfection He asks for criticism to improve the class, but usually just whines and disagrees A is possible, but expect him to make you feel bad about yourself
Besides a good teacher and a caring advisor, he is a nice, honest and very professional and a very helpful person.
