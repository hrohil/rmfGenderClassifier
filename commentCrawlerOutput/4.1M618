If you don't go to class or don't ask for help there is no chance you will pass the class at all. This class is easy if you actually attend and pay attention and just try to do your best. He is a little bit of a tough grader but if you actually take the time to email or talk to him about homework he will give you lots of points back. Pop quiz two.
One of the worst professors I have ever had. He is completely full of himself. Goes off-topic quite often. Is not clear about what he wants you to learn or how to answer questions he asks. Does not actually clarify when asked. Is extremely vague and you could learn the same amount by simply reading w3schools for basic database knowledge.
Makes datamining techniques understood and presents methods in context with modern applications.
He did a great job in covering the most important aspects of database architecture. Knowlegeable, punctual, and eager to help.
I liked this course.  Leo focuses on practical aspects of things.  He relates practice to theory in a way that makes sense.  He is strict with class requirements but he is very fair.
Practical approach great.  Needs a better textbook
Half of what he says is bs, you just don't know which half. Also, extremely full of himself. He is a marketer and he himself is the product. Which got him far, apparently. He may dazzle you until you know better. Think of the manager from "The Office".
Great databases professor.
