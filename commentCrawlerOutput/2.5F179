She was absolutely awful. No personality and no sense of humor. Didn't help one bit and let me just fall through the cracks. Completely Incompetent. I walked in to class on the first day and I said "hello" to her and I just got a blank stare back. I should've known right then that she was going to be a horrible professor.
Beth was a great professor for my intro computer science course. Most days she gives a brief (5 min or less) lecture and then lets you start working on your own. If you get stuck, just ask and she is happy to help, and does so in a straight forward way. The class was low stress and I enjoyed it a lot.
