section can be a pain but the class is very easy. I attended (almost) every lecture and got a 98 on the first exam and a 92 on the second exam. 15412
Good teacher.  His lectures can go on but they are easy to understand and useful.  The projects take a long time because like most TAs they are completely useless.
This is a really easy class, he's a super nice guy. The lectures aren't that exciting, but you don't even really have to go because he posts all of his lecture slides online afterwards.
