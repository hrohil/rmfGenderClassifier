I've taken 3 classes with her, no one has received an A. I have received a 92.73 and was told that my work was "great, but not A quality", this was the top grade for the course. Does not give clear expectations and believes leaving out instructions is key to building good developers.
Although her grading was tough and goes through material very quickly, its with the expectation that you read the material before class and you have 2 weeks to complete assignments. Her quizzes are hard, but its open notes and open book. Where she provides the most value is in her industry insight. Advice: stay ahead and ask industry questions
Great lecturer but doesn't like to give anyone an A even if they have earned it. Hater.
Exams are difficult, written with an attempt to trick you. 98% of class time is spent watching her blow through PowerPoint slides; no actual programming work is ever done in class. Might was well try and learn to speak Arabic watching someone run through a slide deck for 3 hours. Knowledgeable but stubborn.
