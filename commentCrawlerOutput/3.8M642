Computer science is one of the hardest to teach as a teacher so, don't expect it to get everything by listening make sure you do every question given then it's an easy A+.
Skon is the nicest Professor you will ever meet in Kenyon College. It's hard to keep up with him it's true but when it comes to helping he will be available anytime, and very helpful if you reach up to him. I will definitely take the course with him again.
Took Intro to Programming, and was a difficult class. Skon is caring and nice person, but the way he taught the class made it impossible to stay on track. He is disorganized and goes so fast when he lecture and writes code in class that it is impossible to catch up with him. His lab assignment are very hard and time consuming. Avoid!
Skon knows what he is doing and, unlike some in the Math/Computer Science department here at Kenyon, doesn't just lecture on what he knows. He leads the class through the basics of programming, allowing for trial-and-error but not allowing for any student to fall behind in the process. A wonderful method to teach material like this!
He is an intelligent and nice man but doesn't know how to teach. I wish he could have been my caring uncle rather than my professor.
