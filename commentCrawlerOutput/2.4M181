Love and respect the guy.
Took a programming class from Amer.  He is passionate about his work, strict in grading.  I saw other reviews, they are not accurate. If you are a good hard-working student, you should take his class. If you are looking for an easy class, stay away from him.
awesome teacher
Awful teacher and a total dick. Blows at his subject. Be prepared to kiss ass for a decent grade.
Amer must be writing his own reviews, because no student would *EVER* rate his classes as "Very Easy". (Notice all positive reviews are on 2/18/03) Take from someone else if you can, if not stay on his good side and answer questions in class.  G
Learn a lot in this class, but due to such harsh grading I would reccomend another professor.
Horrible Horrible Man

Pedantic, harsh grader.  Do not take anything from him if at all possible.
