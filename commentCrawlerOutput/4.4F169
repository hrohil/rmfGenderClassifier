Alexa is a decent lecturer with excellent powerpoints. Unfourtuantely, she is not very helpful outside of class. If you want to get help in office hours or ask clarifying questions about confusing topics, her classes are not for you.
Alexa is a wonderful, helpful professor. She's extremely knowledgeable and an exciting lecturer. I would highly recommend her classes.
Best professor I've had.  Can't recommend highly enough.
She's fantastic. Major recommendations!
She's wonderful and brilliant! Really clear, and really fun! I love computer science now. TAKE HER CLASS.
Alexa's refreshingly funny. She's always willing to help, and she's really pretty, too! *wink
Alexa is really great. I thought CS 150 with her was a lot of fun. She knows what she's doing. Highly recommend.
