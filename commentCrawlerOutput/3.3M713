He is a great Prof. Always helpful, and has a wonderful beard.
He's the best
Class was very boring, however he did provide help with assignments and projects. Did really teach us. Expected us to learn everything from the book.
I had him for first year seminar and the class overall was pretty boring. He's a nice guy and is pretty good with helping you when you need it, but the texts he chose for this particular course weren't the best. On the papers we wrote, he was a really easy grader. Not sure how he would be in a normal CS class.

very nice man... but don't take his class if you actually want to learn something...
He's not a great classroom prof.  But, what he lacks there, he makes up for in pure knowledge and an extreme willingness to help outside of class.  If you talk to him outside of class, he's really really helpful, and will guide you as much as you need.
