Pros: By the end of this class, you will have some decent knowledge of how to built your own working programming language. Cons: Impossible midterm and final, high risk since they are worth most of your grade. Labs take 16+ hours a week. Help is limited beyond classroom forcing you to goto office hours. Don't take this course with Chang if you can.
Took his Principles of Programming Languages class.  If you don't ABSOLUTELY have to take this class, do not do it.  Its 'project-based' meaning he doesn't teach you anything, you are supposed to discover it on your own, as you work through a series of lab assignments written in a language you don't know(scala).
This class is ridiculously hard and Change does not help make it any easier. Do NOT take this class with Chang. He will make you life a living hell.
This class is just insane with the amount of work that you have to put in just for the labs, grading interviews, in-class exercises, online exercises, and you also have to participate in online weekly discussion. All that amount of work will not prepare you for the Midterm or Final Exam. Professor teaching style and as teacher is just terrible.
Yeah, it's a hard class.  You have so many outlets to get help through: classes are entirely based off what everyone needs help with, the recitations are extremely useful, and he answers every question on the online forum within like 2 hours. This class is his baby so take it was Chang-- NO ONE ELSE. And it's curved so you'll be fine.
I came, I saw, and I left. Chose not to take this class for credit to avoid a catastrophe. This professor was just not working for me at all on many levels; oh, and groups are mandatory.
Per credit-hour, one of the most intensive classes I've taken. He is a good teacher, but don't expect hand-holding. If you pay attention, you will learn a lot and do well because he knows what he is talking about. The tests are also impossible, but they are extremely curved.
The course required an incredibly high amount of work to complete the lab assignments and was capped off by a soul crushingly difficult final exam that the labs, quizzes, and everything in the course up until the exam didn't even come close to preparing me for. If you value your time or sanity stay far far away.
Class is way too hard. Lectures don't explain material well. Tests insanely hard. Far too much time required. Assignments require many hours, but overall grading only weights 20% on homework results. Tests don't reflect homework but then count 65% toward overall grade. Class needs to be re-thought. He means well, but this is a bad class.
