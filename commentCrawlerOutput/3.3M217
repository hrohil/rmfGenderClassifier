Horrible lecturer, discusses a topic which is mostly unrelated to what you have to do later, and skips over essential difficult topics which he frequently asks about (design patters for the most part). His homework is ridiculously long and the textbook is 90% useless in relation to his course material. If you value your happiness, take COMS1004
Class subject itself is interesting. Topics included various methods of developing visual interfaces including biometrics. But you won't learn how to actually implement them. That you have to figure out yourself when you do projects on your own. Be careful - Kender has sent multiple students to Dean's Discipline for supposed 'cheating allegations'.
An excellent professor, perhaps even the best in the CS department. Take his classes!
He is a very mentoring and attentive advisor.  He devotes at least one hour of personal meeting time each week with each grad. student and schedules more time if necessary.
