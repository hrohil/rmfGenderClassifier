I had Kevin for Alt Lens, a funky digital photography class that was super informative. I love how ATLAS is unconventional and blends art classes with design and engineering courses. There is truly nothing else like it at CU and Kevin Hoth is a key contributor to that.
Kevin is a photography wiz without the pompous bs associated with CUs photography department. He doesn't spoon feed or give easy A's. I got some B grades and some As. Others below say he's a harsh grader and that's not a complete lie. I'd say he just doesn't accept half assed work for A credit. The A projects in class were obvious though.
He's tough, and sometimes he's overly particular in what he sees as "art", but he's willing to be swayed if you take him seriously. If you give an honest and thoughtful effort, he'll usually appreciate it. He gets less reachable in large classes, but his Alt Image class is really cool. He's got a lot of experience, but you have to seek it out.
I feel like this would have been a better class if it was two labs per week. Lecture was pointless and isn't at all why I signed up for T.A.M. Two labs would also let him teach more in class so we would stop watching boring Lynda videos.
I took Image last year and I am taking Alternative Digital Images now with Kevin. Image was bad like people said. You could tell he just hated giving big lectures to 100 people. Alternative Images is a better class in a small room. I'm a studio art major and Atlernative Images better than what is taught in the Art Dept.
Fine class. Least favorite of the TAM program because the projects were boring to me
Extremely knowledgable and helpful professor.  Kevin knows what he's talking about and has a ton of experience.   Yes, you have to apply yourself, but that's part of your education; you get out what you put in.  Kevin builds a solid framework to work in.  Good class and instructor overall.
Very unclear in project descriptions and rude. Since the projects are "art" he grades subjectively. Even though you may do good work in photoshop, if its missing what he calls a "human element" or "just doesnt like the rudimentary idea" he will grade harshly. Also projects are worth 25% of the grade and there are three of them.
I had Kevin for Digital Media 1. He's not the most exciting of professors but he knows what he's talking about. Pay attention and ask questions if you need help because if you fall behind in coding or photoshop you're done for. Definitely easier if you come into class with existing knowledge of htmlcssadobe.
