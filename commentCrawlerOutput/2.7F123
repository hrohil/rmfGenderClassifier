All tests are very heavy fill in the blank and essay questions that require very precise answers. Very strict on assignment due dates, but takes weeks to post the grade.
She is the only professor you will have that makes you write in single space half-inch margins Avoid her at all costs she lost my assignments and then would not email me back unless I harassed her. If you have to take her class for credit do so but you have to stay on her every step of the way.
This teacher helped me out when I had an unexpected death during finals. She is also very responsive and willing to work with you with assignments and such. I would recommend her to anyone doing online classes for Computer Science at the Continuing School of Study.
