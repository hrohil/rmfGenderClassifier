Great! One of my favorite CS classes I've ever taken.  Very clear and consistent.  Gives a very thorough understanding. Lectures are fun and interesting.
Mike Vanier is an intersting and, at times, hilarious professor who made CS 1 a pleasure to take (aside from those dang environment diagrams). A clear, knowledgeable lecturer, and a cool guy.
Nice cource, learn python in 3 hrs.  Vanier is helpful and his assignments are interesting.
