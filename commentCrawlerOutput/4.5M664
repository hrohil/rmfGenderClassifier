PM is a really ameizing professor. He is humorous and intelligent, he gave reasonable amount of assignments and those assignments were  extremely useful and interesting to do. It was an enjoyment to take his class and I would definitely take it again. His graders and mentors are ameizing as well.
PM is exceptionally organized. He always posts assignments on time and gets assignments back to his students within a couple days. He's a really cool dude and he always keeps his language G-rated too.
Osera is very clear, and often presents things visually (this is a data structures class). The class is really fun, although there are a few long homework assignments. Just start them earlier. The C Programming book is online, so don't buy it if you can't afford it/don't want to. Especially take this if you're interested in CS but hated 151!
Lectures are easy to follow and he is also very easy-going. Homework is usually a big project, and he doesn't believe in providing the grading rubric. Exams are hard; being able to do his practice exams doesn't prove anything. Although, he a is reasonable person, so he is willing to slide everyone's grades up if the entire class did terribly on it.
Always willing to help students with questions  Funny &amp; lectures are not boring  Knows his stuff, and you'll learn a lot, but the class is easy - ideal  There is a lot of homework, though.  It's a time commitment
