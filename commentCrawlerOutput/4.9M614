He wrote the textbook! Literally! He really knows his stuff and the only problem is that he tries to cover more than the slow students can take in.
Amazing professor, always available for discussion after class, "there are no dumb questions" in his class. You can ask him any and everything.
He is really fun in class, but tests are tough.  Study what he hints at in class.
