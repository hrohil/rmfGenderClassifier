This professor is extremely difficult, as if the material were not difficult as it is, his assignments are very challenging and time consuming. Very smart and knowledgeable, if you are up for a challenge be ready, i mean it, are you top 1%?
It's a hard subject, so it's gonna be hard to teach. He's extremely knowledgeable though.
I'll admit, Eggert isn't the easiest professor, but you actually learn your stuff in his class.  He has an excitment and a passion for what he teaches, and that translates into a class that students actually enjoy and pay attention to.
He is a very difficult teacher
