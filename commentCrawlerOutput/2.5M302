Really bad. Not verse in topics.Avoid him; take other ML courses in AMS or BME. Those instructors are defintely better!
This professor really cares about his students, and he really wants you to learn his stuffs. Work hard and you will be okay with this course and learn a lot.
It's a great professor with a lot of home work. If you pay a lot of attention on it, you will get good reward.
a waste of time, prof avoids answering anything but the most superficial questions, can't deal with theory or anything formal.  made lots of mistakes in grading and in lecture.  assignment were riddled with errors.  class devolved into "what people do" and abandoned "why they might do it" or anything useful for serious ml students
