Best.
One of the better professors in the dept. Problems are relevant in the CS discipline and in CS job interview questions. Wish he taught more courses and made it a bit more difficult. Homeworks are fun and lectures are concise and helpful. Take this course!
Not the hero we deserve but the hero we need
Best thing to happen to Emory CS.
Very knowledgeable in NLP. Wished that this class was more focused on machine learning. Definitely a unique elective course worth taking.
He is one of the greatest CS professor at Emory. He is brilliant and really cares of his student. He makes sure you get the grade you deserves. He is always there if you need help with course material.
Good lecturer and really cares about what you learn more than what you already know. One of the most important class to take not just for computer science majors. People complain that his class is hard, but they obviously don't put in the work and just complain.
Hard grader and hard tests. Cares about students success and really will take time to learn everyones name and if you go to his office hours he will sit with you until you understand the material
