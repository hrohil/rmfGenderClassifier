Professor Aikat was nice but it is very easy to tune her out in class.  She takes attendance daily so it is important to be there.  The first half of the class is straight forward, but it is very easy to become lost in the second half.  Going to TA office hours is crucial.
I ended up taking COMP110 just to maintain a 15 hour course load, and it ended up being one of the bests classes I've ever taken here.  Professor Aikat is very clear with instructions, and drops your lowest assignment grade, which makes life so much easier.  Lectures were fun, and she is quite funny at times.
She drops your lowest assignment and quiz grade and gives clear instructions about what is expected of you on assignments. Easy A if you pay attention and make sure you can do the examples from class yourself.
The second half of the semester the material is a lot more challenging and confusing. It is really easy to get lost in lecture, but going to office hours helps out a lot. Parts of the assignments are difficult, but there aren't many and you can go to office hours and knock them out in two hours or so tops.
Pretty easy class with a few assignments and labs. There are multiple opportunities for help if you're struggling but overall its relatively manageable. She's a good teacher.
This class definitely required effort. Lectures were ok; easy to tune out or get lost. However office hours is very helping and the assignments help you understand a lot; that why they are worth 50% of final grade. The midterm and final are not so horrible. As long as you understand basics, you will do fine on those. Got 70% on both and got an A.
I took this class Spring 2014; it was 300 kids in GNS lecture hall. The first half of the class is easy; the second is confusing. She had 5 personal office hours a week and 10 with the TAs. She offered 9 points on your final letter grade throughout the semester. Do the work; the first half gets 60% of your grade and is easy. Tests are tricky.
Midterm and final were sort of tricky, but similar to study guide. Programming assignments are 50% of your grade so if you do all of them and study for test you can at least make a B. TAs are very helpful. She gives extra credit opportunities to add 3 points on to your final grade. Class was boring, but she has daily attendance quizzes.
If you are not a math person, do not take this class. Probably the worst decision I've made at carolina. Daily attendance. She gives tests that are extremely difficult and lots of trick questions. The class has about 10 TA's who do not communicate correctly with what will be on tests. She gives you study guides but they are LITTERED with errors.
