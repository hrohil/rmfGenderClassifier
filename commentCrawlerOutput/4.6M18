He's an amazing professor who knows his stuff very well, but he will make you work for the grade. Interacts with his students often, and is willing to help out whenever.
I started this class with no knowledge of programming, but Glen Structured the class well enough that i was able to finish the touch assignments on time.  Good Professor, teaches the best classes at Caltech
AWESOME
He lectures well, though it is his organization, lecture notes, and his approachability and helpfulness that make him an _amazing_ teacher.
Very tough class, but he was always there to help and is extremely patient, even with the most incompetent students (like me!)  Lectures were a bit boring and dry, but generally clear and he was very thorough with the material.  One of the best instructors I ever had in EE although I've now moved on to forestry/biogeography.

I've been in the software industry for four years now, and the man I can thank most for my success is Glen.
Took CS1 in '97.  Made thorough notes and answered questions in class.
