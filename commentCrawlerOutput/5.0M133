Dan is an absolute gem. He is so kind and intelligent, and has AMAZING availability to help. The class content can be tough, but he only ever wants you to succeed and will always give help if you ask (key is asking). He can look at your code and know exactly what's going on in seconds, and is really good at explaining things in different ways.
