While the C++ libraries used in this class are... wonky at best, the actual lecture style and delivery are phenomenal. Very funny, sarcastic humor. Translates topics into REAL ENGLISH.
He also does pop quizzes very often, and they're graded on a Y+ (Yes plus 5/5), Y (Yes 4/5), N(No 3/5), 0 basis.  Only way to get a zero is to not even try.  These quizzes collectively count for 10% of your grade so even if you got N's on all of them you'd still get 6 of that 10%
I've got mixed feelings about TJ.  His lectures are well taught and organized, but his homework is far harder than anything he does in lecture, and he gives a lot of it (about one every week).  Tests are pretty hard.  Fortunately, our homework was graded pretty leniently.  The final exam is him asking you questions in his office. Avoid if possible.
