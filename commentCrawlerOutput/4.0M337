I took Introduction to Programming with Professor Epstein and TA-ed for him the following year. He is a good professor that genuinely cares if whether or not you learn the material. If you have a question, ask; he will help you. Yes, there is such a thing as a stupid question. He won't just give you the answer so pay attention and do the readings.
Professor Epstein always offered to help, but when he did it was often condescending and made me regret ever asking. He was available outside class which helped especially during the final project, which can be done in a pair. Two tests, homework and labs count for a lot. So even if you don't show up to lab, make sure you complete the problems.
