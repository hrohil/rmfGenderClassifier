                      One of the most inspirational professors of all time. He made me laugh by dancing on desks, and cry on the last day of class with his emotional annecdote on pursing our dreams. He gave every student a special business card with a painting on it to go with the story that I still carry in my wallet to motivate me everyday. Also learned SO much.
                  
                      Bruce Conforth is the most passionate, intelligent, and talented person and musician I have ever met.  I wish I took more of his courses, as his History of American Blues Music enhanced my perspective on so many things. A true icon of the music world.
                  
                      I am so lucky to have taken a class taught by this guy! Insanely passionate and funny, really knows his stuff, and I never wanted to miss a lecture.
                  
                      Coolest dude ever, really knows what he's talking about and cares about students. Class was based on weekly reflection papers, 3 take-home online quizzes, midterm, final, and one project. Don't bother doing any readings - don't even buy the book. Go to his office hours with your midterm, he will give you points back.
                  
                      If you show up to class every day and really pay attention to his lectures, Bruce will probably change your life - fair warning. I have never had another professor that has half the passion and zeal that he brings to every single lecture. He cares immensely about the topics that he teaches and he cares about his students even more. Don't miss out.
                  
                      This was my favorite class of all time. Bruce teaches because he wants to inspire, and he wants students to reflect on what they are doing with themselves. I never missed a lecture because they were so interesting, and I would talk about what I'd be learning with my friends because I enjoyed it to that extent. Definitely take a class with Bruce
                  
                      This guy was great! He was passionate each and every day he came to class and seemed as knowledge as anyone about the information he was teaching. The material reflected a great deal of personal depth and experience. He was rarely competitive. There are two exams with easy online homework in-between. On the whole, a worthwhile class.
                  
                      The fact that Dr. Conforth is a great scholar in the subjects he teaches (I've taken AC208, AC219, and AC405 with him) the fact that he has personal experience in each topic makes him an invaluable resource as a teacher.  I doubt that there are many other professors who have as much and as extensive real world experience in their topics as he does.
                  
                      Bruce's seminar on American Folk music was an amazing experience.   We discussed the incredible link between folk music and left wing politics (something I knew nothing about), the ways in which people band together as communities and create art to express themselves and build solidarity,  and so so much more.  Amazing class.
                  
                      Legend
                  
                      Easily one of the best professors at UM. Never known a single person to have a bad opinion of him. He is incredibly knowledgeable about the 60s and the hippy movement (as a result of him being very deeply ingrained in it). His stories make each class fun, and I am changing my plans for future classes to take more with him.
                  
                      Hippies, Beatniks, and Punks was the best class I've taken at U of M so far. I actually WANTED to go to class, because Bruce is such an inspirational guy. His lectures are really interesting, I felt like I got to know all three of the subcultural groups, but my favorite parts of the class were Bruce's life stories. Definitely take this class.
                  
                      After 4 years I finally got to take Bruce's subcultures course and wow was it worth the wait!  I don't think there are any other professors like Bruce anywhere.  He's caring, compassionate, unbelievably intelligent, witty, funny, hot as hell, and just is everything and more that you'd want in a professor.  An amazingcourse,  Bruce is incredible!
                  
                      Bruce Conforth is honestly one of the best professors I have had. He makes everyone feel like they matter in his class. He tries to make his lectures not only about the information, but also about life in general. The quizzes and tests are kind of tough, but this class is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Take it.
                  
                      This is the 3rd class I've taken with Professor Conforth and every one has been remarkable.  He's a great teacher.  Clear, concise, interesting, funny, and extremely knowledgeable.  He's just an amazing prof.  The best UM has to offer.
                  
                      This class has been nothing short of astonishing.  I never experienced anything like the remarkable way Dr. Conforth teaches and I don't think I ever will again.  He's the smartest, most caring professor you could want.  I've already learned more about the topic and life than I have in all my other classes combined and I'm a senior! Take his class
                  
                      It is absolutely unbelievable the way that Bruce teaches a class.  Not only is he an amazing scholar and knows so much about so many things, the life lessons he teaches you are remarkable.  If you go to class (you'll want to) and you pay attention (it's hard not to) you'll leave his class an infinitely greater person.
                  
                      I was expecting a bit more from Professor Conforth; with all the hype, i thought this would be the greatest class I ever took by a long shot. Not the case - while the course was interesting, it just didn't live up to the hype. Not hard to get a good grade if you study enough for the exams, and lecture was always fairly interesting to attend.
                  
                      Bruce is a legend at UM and there many reasons why.  He's compassionate, incredibly interesting, REALLY knows a LOT, worked at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and as a musician, he's a scholar, but most of all he REALLY cares if you learn the stuff in class and how you can apply it to your own life.  He's hands-down the best prof at UM!
                  
                      Dr. Conforth is an awesome professor.  His lectures are very interesting and you can tell he genuinely enjoys the subject matter.  The class is pretty easy to get a B- in, but beyond that you really need to work hard to get a better grade.  I, unfortunately, realized I was not interested in folklore, but Dr. Conforth still made lectures interesting
