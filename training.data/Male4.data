                      Dave Winn is by far my favorite professor at the University of Michigan. He's lectures are both very intense and extremely hilarious!
                  
                      I thought he was a decent professor, but I wouldn't say amazing or anything. This might be because persoanlly I wasn't really a fan of the subject matter he taught to begin with, but his explanations often confused me more, and the quizzes were unnecessarily stressful.
                  
                      Dr. Winn is the best professor I've ever had at Michigan. He makes the toughest engineering prerequisite a course that you actually want to take and show up for lecture. He's very understanding and accessible outside of class; however, the class itself is very, very tough. Be ready to study a lot.
                  
                      Dave Winn is probably a good professor, but Physics 240 is impossible at Umich. The lectures have little to nothing to do with quizzes, and homework problems are never tested on. Most of the content is learned on your own. Dave is a friendly, funny guy though.
                  
                      Winn is honestly a good professor, I just personally struggle with Physics and he intentionally makes the quizzes very hard. If I was a Physics or Engineering major, I would probably love him, but as someone who is just trying to pass the class, it's pretty tough.
                  
                      Makes class enjoyable and explains very well. Incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the topics
                  
                      Professor Winn was an excellent professor, covering a lot of material quickly and clearly. That said, I wish I had taken multivariable calculus before taking this class rather than at the same time. This course requires a lot of work and the quizzes don't necessarily reflect the homework assignments, so the practice quizzes and roulette are key.
                  
                      A very good lecturer who teaches the topics well and focuses on the conceptual background. Also he has a lot of great demonstrations, which help give the content a real world connection, something more inherently difficult in 240.
                  
                      Solid choice. Very clear instructor. His jokes are the amazing part of this class (but people seem to not get those all the time)
                  
                      One of my favorite professors. Wore sandals and the same shorts everyday which I loved. Class is hard and sometimes he puts really hard questions on exams and doesn't realize it but overall a great guy and great lecturer. Also can't move well. Jokes are hilarious.
                  
                      Professor Winn is, without question, the worst professor I've ever had at the University of Michigan. He's scattered and can not clearly present relevant material. The textbook is the only thing that stopped me from failing. Take 405 with literally anyone else. I'm pretty sure I understand less having finished the course than I did after 260.
                  
                      Winn is an amazing lecturer, and the perfect mix between funny and awkward. Quizzes can be hard, but the lowest grade is dropped and there is lots of extra credit available. If you do enough Problem Roulette and don't cheat with iClickers, you can get an A.
                  
                      Fantastic lecturer. Professor Winn constantly makes the class laugh. He also does a great job of making highly complex physics concepts seem immensely simpler. If you are about to take Physics 240, I HIGHLY recommend you take it with Professor Winn. Plus he always wears socks and chacos, which is undoubtedly the greatest outfit in existence.
                  
                      This guy could be the most awkward professor I've had to date, but he's an incredible lecturer. Probably one of the few collegiate lectures actually worth going to without additional incentives.
                  
                      Great lecturer. The grading in his class is based on only 6 quizzes, with the lowest quiz grade dropped. There is extra credit for showing up to class and answering iClicker questions as well as doing the homework.
                  
                      He is by far the most amazing professor I ever have at UofM. He is very caring about his students and want us to get As in the class. He is very helpful during the i-clickers and try to help us as much as possible. He is funny, generous, and has a cute sense of fashion. Physics 240 is supposed to be a hard class but he makes it worth it.
                  
                      I wasn't a fan of Professor Winn.  Even though he's funny during lecture, his teaching is always heavy on the theoretical material and he never covers any problems with math (which is what most of the homework/exams is based on).  Only good part of this class is that the extra credit can significantly raise your grade (brought me from B+ to A).
                  
                      Prof Winn's jokes and quirky personality made 9am lecture worth it. The material is tough, but you'll do well if you start your hw early and go to office hours (camp out in the Physics Help Room). He recommends doing Problem Roulette to study, but I redid the hw & lecture slides. DO THE PRELECTURES! easy points + makes life SO much easier trust me
                  
                      Overall he's a really solid professor. He's funny and makes jokes in class but also covers the material thoroughly and at a good pace. He has very strict grading criteria which he clearly lays out at the beginning of the term but he also has no leeway for bumping up grades
                  
                      Winn is a fantastic lecturer. He's excited about the material, and he's excited to teach it. He also keeps it engaging with demos and a great witty sense of humor.
